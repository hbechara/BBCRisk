https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/14/politics/israel-iran-attack-planning-trump,How days of frantic diplomacy and dire warnings culminated with Israel’s attack on Iran,2025-06-14 09:00:03,"President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum this spring to Iran’s Supreme Leader: Strike a nuclear deal in 60 days, by mid-June, or face consequences. He urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on attacking Iran to give the negotiations space to progress.
But even as Trump administration figures were publicly projecting determination to pursue a diplomatic solution, Israel was privately warning the US that it had already decided to attack.
Late last month, a small group of House lawmakers visited Netanyahu in Jerusalem, where he stated firmly that Israel was going to strike Iran – and they were not seeking permission from the US to do so, according to a person who attended the meeting and another person briefed on it.
“We fight or we die,” Netanyahu told the lawmakers, according to the people.
In response, two of the lawmakers in attendance May 26, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Rep. Michael Lawler of New York, urged Israel to coordinate with the US and stressed that the country must let Trump’s 60-day ultimatum for Iran run its course.
On Friday, day 61, Israel launched unprecedented strikes on Iran, targeting its nuclear program and military leaders.
“This didn’t just happen overnight,” the attendee told CNN, adding that Trump’s 60-day deadline “was not a bluff.”
Trump made a similar point to CNN Friday. “Iran should have listened to me when I said — you know, I gave them, I don’t know if you know but I gave them a 60-day warning and today is day 61,” he said.
The attack was much longer in the making – the result of years of meticulous planning by Israel and days of high-stakes talks between Tel Aviv and Washington, according to officials CNN spoke to in both countries. It has long been a priority for Israel to destroy Iran’s nuclear capability, which Netanyahu described Friday as a “threat to Israel’s very survival.”
The Trump administration knew in advance it was coming and that Netanyahu was unlikely to be dissuaded, with the US rallying international pressure on Iran even as diplomats sought to keep negotiations alive to the last minute.
An Iran deal
Trump has long fashioned himself a dealmaker and, after pulling the US out of the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal in 2018, made clear at the beginning of his second term that he would like to find a new diplomatic solution with Iran.
But in the intervening years, Iran had made significant strides toward obtaining a nuclear weapon. The president and top officials had asserted Iran could not obtain a nuclear weapon – but it was unclear whether they would allow Iran to enrich uranium, which hawks in the US and Israel strongly opposed, or how any deal would be different from the Obama agreement.
Israel, meanwhile, was watching Iran’s enrichment efforts with heightened concern and making meticulous plans for an attack. The Israeli intelligence agency Mossad put spies on the ground inside Iran and smuggled weapons into the country, according to Israeli security officials, and would use the weapons to target Iran’s defense from within. The officials said Israel also established a base for launching explosive drones inside Iran.
Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz on Friday said the strikes’ timing was aimed at both thwarting Iran’s capabilities and removing the threat of destruction from Israel.
“We are at a key point where, if we miss it, we will have no way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons that will threaten our existence,” he said. “We have dealt with Iran’s proxies over the past year and a half, but now we are dealing with the head of the snake itself.”
Trump had long warned of potential military strikes if a new nuclear deal wasn’t reached, and Tehran, in turn, said that any attack on it would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.
Negotiations on a new deal, led by special presidential envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and moderated by Oman, began in April. The group last met for talks on May 23 in Rome – three days before Netanyahu told US lawmakers he planned to strike – with a sixth round initially scheduled for Sunday in Muscat.
On Thursday, hours before the Israeli strikes began, the International Atomic Energy Agency board, a United Nations nuclear watchdog, met and adopted a resolution declaring Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations. The resolution ultimately passed with 19 nations voting in favor, three against, and 11 abstentions, according to Reuters.
Two days earlier, the US sent a demarche to eight countries that it viewed as potentially persuadable, urging them to either vote with the US on the IAEA vote or not vote at all, according to a US official. The move marked a major engagement from the US on the issue, which Israel pointed to as one of its rationales for its strikes.
Still, White House officials continue to argue after the strikes that the president is committed to salvaging the ongoing nuclear talks. Witkoff is “ready” to meet Iranian officials when they are, whether it be in Oman on Sunday as previously scheduled or at some date thereafter, according to a source familiar with discussions.
Trump suggested Friday that Iranian officials had been in touch with him as he continued to express optimism about a deal.
“They may have another opportunity. We’ll see,” Trump said. “They’re calling me to speak,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News.
Asked who was calling, he said, “The same people we worked with the last time … Many of them are dead now.”
Israel plans
The US had a relatively clear picture of the scope of the Israeli operation as early as last week, when some intelligence officials were already receiving multiple updates daily and were planning for different contingencies depending on how Iran responded, according to one source with direct knowledge of that planning.
Although Israel minimized what it shared with the Trump administration, that source said the US understood the targets and order of operations – even if the extent of the damage to Iran, including losses to its leadership, and the question of how Iran would respond remained unknown.
On Sunday evening and Monday, Trump and top advisers, including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, huddled at Camp David for previously scheduled meetings on a number of foreign policy issues. Among the topics of discussion at the retreat: how to get an Iran nuclear deal done without an escalation. And the clock was ticking.
That same weekend Witkoff engaged in direct messaging with his Iranian counterpart in the talks, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Early in the week Witkoff also reached out to the Omani intermediaries with a new idea for a possible deal framework, according to a source familiar with the matter. The initial proposal from the US tabled during the 5th round of talks in Rome – which Iran was privately opposed to – was changing. It was unclear what prompted the proposal of a new concept, but by Friday, some people involved in the talks began to think that it was a stalling tactic by Witkoff.
But a senior administration official said no stalling tactics were used, with Witkoff working “from the outset to reach a deal under the timeline set by President Trump.”
Before he departed Camp David, the president and Netanyahu spoke by phone to discuss Iran. During their call, Trump asked Netanyahu to stop talking about an attack on Iran, a source familiar with the conversation said, and halt the leaks and reports about plans. After the call, the president cast some doubt on prospects nuclear talks would bear fruit.
“We’re trying to make a deal so that there’s no destruction and death. And we’ve told him (Netanyahu) that, and I’ve told him that. I hope that’s the way it works out, but it might not work out that way. We’ll soon find out,” Trump told reporters.
In a podcast taped the same day, Trump acknowledged to the New York Post he was getting “less confident” about the possibility of a deal.
Trump’s rhetoric was becoming less optimistic at the same time US officials were beginning to believe that Iran was not going to accept a deal with the US terms.
A brewing attack
Public signs that something was afoot began to emerge on Wednesday afternoon, US time, when the US State Department prepared to order the departure of non-essential personnel from the US embassy in Iraq and US consulate in Erbil, as well as nonessential personnel and family members at the US embassies in Bahrain and Kuwait, due to what sources described as increased security risks in the region. The president was aware of the decision, a White House official said at the time.
Trump began to nod publicly at the possible attack, warning during an East Room event about the potential for a “massive conflict” in the Middle East that could take place “soon.”
“We have a lot of American people in this area, and I said, look, we gotta tell them to get out cause something could happen – soon. And I don’t want to be the one that didn’t give any warning and missiles are flying into their buildings,” he said.
Top Trump officials were instructed to call their counterparts in the region on Thursday with a message that was heavy on the need for diplomacy and emphasized that the US was not involved. They were not always successful in getting through; Tulsi Gabbard, for example, was unable to reach her Israeli counterpart.
By late Thursday, it was clear to the Trump administration that Israel could not be dissuaded from launching the attacks, according to two other US officials who spoke to CNN at the time. One of the officials said the US thought it might be able to delay the operation by a matter of hours to put in place protections for its own forces in the region, but no more.
Trump spoke with Netanyahu multiple times on Thursday. Trump convened a Cabinet-level meeting Thursday as the strikes took place. A carefully balanced message soon went out.
“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a terse statement. “Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”
‘Full-spectrum blitz’
Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress were not surprised that Israel took the step, though some were privately taken aback by the scope.
House Speaker Mike Johnson was briefed ahead of the strikes on Thursday, one person said, though there was no Gang of Eight briefing in Congress, per two congressional sources. Top lawmakers, including committee leaders, were scrambling for briefings from the administration on Thursday night and Friday.
And even though US diplomats had worried about the increasing likelihood of an Israeli strike on Iran, they were still surprised when it happened Thursday night. “Maybe Donald Trump knew but I don’t think the rest of us did,” one senior US diplomat told CNN.
Going into the attacks, intelligence officials believed Iran would have to take stock of what they had left before retaliating, a US official said.
The regime would have to assess whether it has enough left to be a credible deterrent to ensure its survival – or whether they are already on a path to being deposed. If the latter, officials expected Iran could respond with strategic strikes using what was left of their most sophisticated weapons and terror attacks using their various proxy groups in the region.
Initial battle damage assessments indicate that the Israeli strikes on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility were extremely effective and went far beyond superficial damage to exterior structures, knocking out the electricity on the lower levels where the centrifuges used to enrich uranium are stored, two US officials told CNN.
“This was a full-spectrum blitz,” said another source familiar with early damage assessments.
By Friday night, Iran had carried out attacks on “dozens of targets, military centers and air bases,” belonging to Israel, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement. It was not clear how much more would be coming.
The US is also closely monitoring events in Iraq, where there is a particular concern about the safety of US troops – not only because of the proximity to the Iranian border but also because there are a number of deeply ideological proxy militia groups loyal to Iran operating there.
And although US intelligence officials believe Iran will respond to Israel directly first, they also believe it’s possible that Iran may eventually launch cyber attacks against domestic US critical infrastructure in retaliation.
“The situation is pretty fluid,” a US official said Friday as Iran’s response began. “I think it’s gonna be a long night.”","['Betsy Klein', 'Sarah Ferris', 'Katie Bo Lillis', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Alayna Treene']",en

It is a dramatic turn of events for the American government-funded broadcasting system that was shut down by the Trump administration in March.
Steve Herman, who has been VOA’s chief national correspondent since 2022, said the broadcaster specifically brought back Farsi language speakers who have been on paid administrative leave. The move suggests that the US government wants to bolster its programming into Iran.
Before the cutbacks were instituted in March, VOA said that it produced four-plus hours a day of “Persian-language programming to Iran.”
The VOA website said the content “confronts the disinformation and censorship efforts of the Iranian regime and enhances U.S. efforts to speak directly to the Iranian people and the global Persian-speaking diaspora.”
It is unclear how much content VOA has been beaming into Iran in recent weeks. The broadcaster’s VOA Farsi channel on YouTube showed eight new videos since Israel struck inside Iran early Friday.
Staffers from some other VOA language services have also been called back to work.
Brett Bruen, president of the consulting firm Global Situation Room, reacted to Herman’s X post about the news by tweeting to Kari Lake, the Trump loyalist who has been tasked with gutting VOA.
“Turns out not having a channel to communicate with the Iranian people was a pretty bad idea, @KariLake,” Bruen wrote.
A spokesperson for Lake did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
Patsy Widakuswara, one of the sidelined journalists who is suing the Trump administration to salvage the broadcaster, told CNN on Friday that “VOA’s role in providing independent, factual and authoritative news has been proven throughout countless times of crisis. But after months off the air, we’ve already lost a lot of audience and credibility. They should bring us all back so we can respond to breaking news in all parts of the world.”",['Brian Stelter'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/middleeast/israel-attack-iran-mossad-analysis-latam-intl,Israel’s unprecedented attack shows Iran has become a ‘playground’ for the Mossad,2025-06-13 21:37:13,"Before Israel launched an unprecedented wave of strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military leaders this week, its spies were already on the ground in enemy territory.
Israeli intelligence agency Mossad had smuggled weapons into Iran ahead of the strikes, according to Israeli security officials, and would use the weapons to target Iran’s defense from within.
The officials said Israel established a base for launching explosive drones inside Iran, and the drones were later used to target missile launchers near Tehran. Precision weapons were also smuggled in and used to target surface-to-air missile systems, clearing the way for Israel’s Air Force to carry out more than 100 strikes with upward of 200 aircraft in the early hours of Friday local time.
The plan to disable Iranian defenses seems to have been effective; Israel said all of its aircraft returned safely from the first waves of strikes, appearing to show Israeli air superiority over parts of a country hundreds of miles away.
Intelligence gathered by the Mossad in Iran also gave Israel’s air force the ability to target senior Iranian commanders and scientists.
In an incredibly rare move, the Mossad released video from some of its operations, showing drones attacking what appear to be unsuspecting missile launchers.
It is the latest operation to show how deeply Israel’s intelligence services, including the Mossad, have penetrated some of Iran’s most closely guarded secrets. The operations have made the Mossad appear a nearly unstoppable force in Iran, capable of hitting at some of its highest-ranking officials and most sensitive sites.
“Mossad has treated Iran like its playground for years now,” said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and curator of the Iranist newsletter.
“From assassinating top nuclear scientists to sabotaging Iranian nuclear facilities, Israel has proved time and time again that it has always had the upper hand in this shadow war that has now been playing out in the open since the first tit-for-tat strikes in April 2024.”
An Israeli security source said the latest operation required commando forces operating deep within Tehran and across the country while avoiding detection from Iran’s security and intelligence agencies. The source said Mossad teams targeted air defense missiles, ballistic missiles, and missile launchers as the attack from the Israeli Air Force began.
A second Israeli security source said the Mossad operations were years in the making, involving both intelligence-gathering efforts and the deployment of Mossad commandos deep behind enemy lines.
Some of the Mossad commando forces operated in the Iranian capital itself, according to the security source.
In addition to the drone base established by the Mossad long before Wednesday’s attack, Mossad commandos deployed “precision-guided weapons systems” near Iranian missile air defense systems, which were activated at the same time as the Israeli air force began striking its targets. A second operation deployed sophisticated vehicle-mounted weaponry to target other Iranian defense systems.
The Mossad operation also involved assassinations of top Iranian officials.
Israel has shown – flaunted even – the Mossad’s ability to operate with near impunity in Iran in the past.
Starting in the early-2010s, Iran accused Israel of carrying out a campaign of assassinations against the country’s nuclear scientists. Former Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon tacitly acknowledged the targeted killings when he said in 2015 that Israel cannot be held responsible “for the life expectancy of Iran’s nuclear scientists.”
From 2007 to 2012 Israel allegedly carried out five covert assassinations, nearly all in Tehran, through remote-controlled bombings, or remote-controlled machine guns. Only one of Iran’s key nuclear scientists survived the assassination attempt, Fereydoon Abbasi.
Just last month, Abbasi told Iranian state media that any attack on production sites would have little impact on the timeline of developing a bomb, saying, “our capabilities are spread all over the country. If they target production sites, it will be inconsequential to our timetable, because our nuclear materials are not stored above ground for them to hit.”
Abbasi was one of the scientists killed in Israel’s early morning attack in Tehran.
The Mossad’s actions soon became much more public.
In early-2018, Israel stole Iran’s nuclear archive from Tehran, displaying the intelligence coup in a live broadcast from Jerusalem. Speaking in English, Netanyahu showed off the archive, including what he said were copies of 55,000 pages of Iranian nuclear information and a display of discs he said were 55,000 files.
Iran tried to dismiss Netanyahu’s comments as “childish” and “laughable,” but the plundering of the archive showed the confidence Israel had in the Mossad’s ability to function in Tehran. The operation, which would have required extensive planning and an intimate knowledge of the archive’s location and security, pushed the first Trump administration to withdraw from the original nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
Israel wasn’t done yet.
In November 2020, Israel assassinated Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s chief nuclear scientist, while he was in a bulletproof car traveling with his wife. Fakhrizadeh’s car was moving in a convoy with three security vehicles when he came under fire. Iranian state media said a remote-controlled machine gun opened fire on the nuclear scientist, who had been a long-time target for Israel.
The operation, which Israel has not publicly acknowledged, was carried out with remarkable precision, and it displayed a deep knowledge of Fakhrizadeh’s pattern of life.
And yet despite its repeated inability to stop the Mossad, Iran has proven incapable of improving.
Ram Ben Barak, the former deputy director of the Mossad, said the organization’s continued success is “due to a very, very disliked regime, even hated by most of the public, so this allows for intelligence penetration on one hand, and on the other, you have the sophistication and professionalism of the Israeli intelligence personnel.”
After the start of the war in Gaza, Israel assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the heart of Tehran. A source familiar with the matter said Israel planted an explosive device in a guest house where Haniyeh was known to stay. The bomb was concealed in the room for two months before the targeted killing and detonated remotely once Haniyeh was in the room.","['Tamar Michaelis', 'Oren Liebermann', 'Jeremy Diamond']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/politics/iran-israel-military-intelligence-strikes-analysis,What Israel’s kitchen-sink operation against Iran tells us so far,2025-06-13 00:00:00,"Brett McGurk is a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
Israel’s military and intelligence operation against Iran that began Thursday night is unprecedented in scale and scope. I was on live with Anderson Cooper as it happened and the full extent of the attack began to clarify.
Now that we know more, here are three points to consider as events continue to unfold.
First: A full-spectrum military and intelligence operation, unprecedented in scale, scope and effectiveness.
Israel is calling it “Operation Rising Lion,” an appeal to the Iranian people, the vast majority of whom do not support the ruling regime, with reference to Iran’s national symbol (a lion and sun) before its 1979 revolution. I’d also call it Operation Kitchen Sink: airstrikes, sabotage, operatives acting inside Iran and with targets across the entire country.
Thus far, the result is a swift decapitation of Iran’s military command: its top commander, its top missile and drone commander, the head of Iran’s external support for proxies across the Middle East and many others we likely have not yet heard about.
Any Iranian official right now is either looking over his shoulder or hiding in a bunker — or both. President Donald Trump this morning warned Iran the attacks will continue unless and until Iran returns to the negotiating table and shows it’s prepared to dismantle its nuclear program. This places Iran’s leaders in a severe predicament, fearing for their own lives while seeking to project confidence in their own damaged country and considering response options against Israel.
Second: Israel has demonstrated full intelligence dominance over Iran, and now has air superiority as well, placing Iran in a severe quandary.
By eliminating an entire command structure in a matter of hours, Israel has shown it has total intelligence penetration of Iran, and it has now achieved air dominance as well. This will further limit Iran’s ability to mount a coherent and coordinated response. Israel destroyed much of Iran’s strategic air defense systems in October of last year in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel at the time.
Now, Israel has destroyed the rest and can fly where it pleases over Iran with manned and unmanned aircraft.
Significantly, the Iranian officials who would have met this morning to coordinate a response are all dead. And what Iran attempts, it knows Israel can strike back at will. Iran still has options — missiles, drones, proxies — and no doubt will seek to continue its response, but it’s in a quandary due to the scale and effectiveness of Israel’s attack. Iran’s supreme leader has named replacements for some of the dead commanders, but these are undesirable posts, since they can be targeted at will, particularly if they seek to attack Israel.
Third: Why now? Iran made a fateful strategic error in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attacks against Israel, and then foolishly doubled down with nuclear escalations.
Hamas’s horrific invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, forever changed the strategic equation in the Middle East – but not as Hamas intended. Hamas, a terrorist group long supported by Iran’s Quds Force, the commander of which Israel killed last night, had hoped it would so weaken Israel that Israel’s existence might be called into doubt.
Immediately after the October 7 attacks, Iran fatefully chose to join in the assaults against Israel. It supported Hezbollah in Lebanon to open a northern front against Israel, and it provided munitions to proxies across the Middle East — from Iraq to Syria to Yemen — to attack Israel from multiple directions and simultaneously.
Iran also launched two massive direct salvos of missiles and drones against Israel in April and October of last year. Both attacks were largely defeated by Israel and a coalition of military forces led by the United States, and coordinated from the White House.
At the same time, Israel has made clear that after October 7, it will never again allow threats to fester — whether on its borders or inside Iran. That especially includes Iran’s nuclear program, which after October 7, Iran chose to significantly escalate beyond any conceivable civilian need or use case.
Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency found Iran to be in “egregious failure” with respect to upholding commitments to demonstrate its nuclear program lacks a military dimension. Then, just yesterday in Vienna, 19 countries found Iran to be in breach of its commitments under the nonproliferation treaty — something that has not happened in 20 years. Only Russia, China and Burkina Faso supported Iran in this vote at the IAEA Board of Governors.
Iran responded with another escalation, announcing it would install new advanced centrifuges in a deeply buried facility called Fordow, and declaring a new underground enrichment facility, all once again with no plausible civilian need or use case. The moves threatened to place Iran’s nuclear activities out of reach of a military response should the diplomacy to curtail its program fail.
This was clearly the final straw for Israel, and understandably so. Israel will not watch an adversary sit at the threshold of a nuclear weapons capability. It will act to defend itself, and last night it felt it had unique window to do so.
That opportunity was opened because of the staunch support the United States provided Israel across now two administrations. Hezbollah is degraded and ineffective. The Assad regime in Syria — historically an ally of Iran — is gone, eliminating Iran’s ability to export weapons and terrorists across the Middle East toward Israel. Iran’s air defenses were degraded last year, allowing last night’s air attacks to take place with reduced risk for Israeli pilots.
The crisis is not over, of course. Israel’s attacks are ongoing, as are Iran’s. I helped coordinate the defense of Israel from the White House during those April and October attacks last year. Any attack with hundreds of missiles is extremely serious, but we know how to defend against such attacks, and must be prepared to do so again.
By Friday afternoon Eastern time, Iran had fired “hundreds of various ballistic missiles” toward Israel, in what Tehran called the beginning of its “crushing response” to Israeli attacks on the country. It’s important that the United States do all it can to help defend Israel against these attacks, as it did twice over the course of 2024.
The fastest way to defuse this entire situation for good would be for Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions and for Hamas to release hostages and relinquishing its control in Gaza. They are the ones, after all, who started this war. And until they do so, Israel will continue to act in its own national security interests and the United States will stand by it.
That is the hard and unmovable equation in the Middle East today, sparked by events launched by Hamas and Iran and now rebounding decidedly against them.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/middleeast/how-israels-campaign-to-wipe-out-irans-nuclear-program-unfolded-invs,How Israel’s campaign to wipe out Iran’s nuclear program unfolded,2025-06-13 19:42:20,"Israel launched a wave of unprecedented strikes on Iran shortly before sunrise Friday morning, hitting key sites in the nation’s nuclear program as well as residential areas in upscale neighborhoods of Tehran and killing some of the country’s highest-ranking military leaders.
A CNN analysis of satellite imagery and dozens of videos shared on social media offers insight into how the wide-ranging operation unfolded across the country. The attacks landed hundreds of miles from Tel Aviv, with strikes continuing through the afternoon as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the bombardment could go on for days.
Israel’s military said it used some 200 fighter jets in the operation, called “Rising Lion.” Based on a review of strike targets, the attack had several prongs: Heavy strikes against at least one of Iran’s uranium enrichment sites as well as its stockpiles of ballistic missiles, and more targeted strikes in Tehran to decapitate the regime’s military leadership. It aimed to halt what Israel said was Tehran’s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons.
Videos geolocated and verified by CNN reveal multiple residential neighborhoods were hit across Tehran, including in the north, west and east. Aftermath footage showed crowds and emergency workers surrounding collapsed buildings in densely populated areas.
The Israeli operation came after years of threats and days of heightened speculation.
Earlier in the week, the US had made efforts to withdraw non-essential personnel from locations around the Middle East, with one official citing “developing tension” in the region. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump told reporters in the White House that he did not want Israel to target Iran while talks to reach a new agreement to limit Iranian nuclear enrichment were ongoing.
In retaliation, Iran launched a barrage of missiles toward Israeli territory on Friday evening local time.
Here’s what we know about how Israel’s attack unfolded, minute by minute. All times are local to Iran.
Pre-dawn: First strikes
The first reports of explosions in Tehran came at around 3:30 a.m. local time Friday. Video geolocated by CNN showed a fire burning across several floors of an apartment block in northern Tehran, as emergency services arrived at the scene.
Seven miles west of those buildings – still in the north of the city – another video showed damage from a strike on the upscale Chamran Town neighborhood. An entire wall had been stripped off one of the buildings, with people seen climbing through the rubble inside.
One strike hit centrally near Laleh Park, the site of protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after Iran’s morality police detained her for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.
Beyond the capital, a video showed a strike on the Piranshahr military base in western Iran, some 350 miles (about 560 kilometers) away from Tehran. The video showed the dark night sky being lit up by a series of rapid explosions, with smoke rising in the distance.
Trevor Ball, a munitions researcher and former US Army senior explosive ordnance technician, told CNN the video indicated “rocket motor burning,” which would be consistent with a strike on a ballistic missile storage facility.
Strikes also hit the Natanz nuclear facility, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) south of Tehran. Social media footage showed a huge fireball rising from the site. CNN obtained radar imagery from a space imaging company, Umbra, which captured damage to several areas of the facility. Other satellite imagery reviewed by CNN showed the same damage in more clarity; black plumes of smoke rising from multiple locations across the site.
The Natanz nuclear facility includes two large underground halls believed to hold centrifuges for enriching uranium, according to a 2003 report from the Institute for Science and International Security, which includes satellite imagery of the site under construction in 2002. Based on that imagery, the latest attacks do not appear to have hit the underground buildings, but the full extent of the damage is not yet known.
Iran’s atomic energy agency said its primary nuclear enrichment facility “did not encounter serious damage” and there were “no radiation leaks that would cause concern to the people” after Israel attacked it. The spokesperson of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, said on Iranian state media that the damage was on the ground level away from the underground facility at the plant.
Rafael Grossi, the head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement that “radiation levels outside the Natanz facility remained unchanged” but added that there was “radioactive contamination present inside the facility,” which “can be managed with appropriate protective measures.”
4:14 a.m.: IDF speaks
Soon after the first explosions rocked Tehran, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it had launched preemptive strikes against Iran’s nuclear program.
It said it used jets to strike “dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.”
The statement came at 3:44 a.m. in Israel, which is 30 minutes behind Iran’s time zone.
4:35 a.m.: Rubio distances US
Within minutes, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed that the US was “not involved” in Israel’s strikes and that Israel’s actions were “unilateral.”
“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” Rubio said in a statement on X, anticipating a potential Iranian response.
Sunrise: Strikes continue
Just one mile west of the strikes on Chamran Town, daylight video showed the aftermath of a strike on Tehran’s Chizar neighborhood. A huge hole had been blown in the top two floors of a building, with twisted iron bars hanging from the concrete structure.
Residents of Tehran later told CNN how they had been woken up by their homes “shaking” from Israel’s attack.
A 17-year-old Iranian, who asked to remain anonymous, said people were “screaming” in the streets. “I didn’t know what was happening. It was really scary,” the teenager said.
5:17 a.m.: Netanyahu announces Operation ‘Rising Lion’
As evidence of Israel’s strikes began to pour in, Netanyahu gave a televised address, saying that Israel had acted to “roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival.” He said the operation would continue for as long as it takes “to remove these threats.”
Netanyahu claimed Iran had produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine nuclear weapons. In a report sent to member states May 31, the IAEA had said that Iran possessed a quantity of uranium enriched to 60% purity – not yet weapons-grade, but sufficient to eventually make nine nuclear weapons if further enriched to 90%.
“Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year. It could be within a few months,” Netanyahu said. “This is a clear and present danger to Israel’s survival.”
The prime minister claimed Israel had struck Iran’s main enrichment facility in Natanz, which was corroborated by video of the site.
Past 6 a.m.
As the sun rose, the full scope of Israel’s attack became clearer. Videos published after 6 a.m. showed the aftermath of a strike on a military base and a cargo terminal in the western Kermanshah region, which borders Iraq, over 250 miles from Tehran and 167 miles from Baghdad.
6:26 a.m.: IAEA ‘concerned’
After Netanyahu claimed Israel had targeted the nuclear facility at Natanz, the UN nuclear watchdog confirmed that Natanz had been hit.
“The IAEA is closely monitoring the deeply concerning situation in Iran,” it said.
The agency said it was in contact with Iranian authorities regarding radiation levels in the area. In a later statement, it said it had not observed an increase in radiation.
8:35 a.m.: IDF announces killings
The Israeli military said it had killed three of the most senior men in Iran’s military and its nuclear program.
Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, head of the secretive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was the highest-profile of those killed. In its initial statement, Israel also said it killed Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, and Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid, leader of Iran’s emergency command.
Later, the IDF said it had killed Ali Shamkhani, a close aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC’s air force.
Many of the strikes on Tehran appear to have been targeting these senior officials. Last year, Israel demonstrated its ability to assassinate its adversaries in highly targeted attacks on Iranian soil. In July 2024, it killed Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas – the Iran-backed militia in Gaza – by remotely detonating a bomb that had been hidden in his room in Tehran.
While Friday’s strikes appeared extremely targeted, there have also been reports of civilian casualties.
8:48 a.m.: Iran responds
The IDF said that Iran had launched more than 100 drones towards Israeli territory, and that Israel’s air defenses were preparing to intercept them.
“We’re expecting difficult hours,” it said.
Around midday
Early afternoon, Iranian media reported that Israel had launched a fresh strike on the northwestern city of Tabriz. Tamsin news agency said the Tabriz Airport had come under “heavy Israeli attack.”
12:26 p.m.: Trump posts
After learning the extent of Israel’s attack, Trump urged Iran’s leaders to agree to a new nuclear deal “before there is nothing left” of their country.
Trump said he had given Iran “chance after chance” to make a deal. “JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.
Under a 2015 nuclear deal struck by President Barack Obama, Iran agreed to drastically limit its number of centrifuges and cap uranium enrichment at levels far below those required to make weapons, in exchange for sanctions relief.
But during his first term as president in 2018, Trump withdrew from the deal, saying the “rotten structure” of the agreement was not enough to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. He ramped up sanctions on Iran and threatened to sanction any country that helped the regime obtain nuclear weapons.
In his second term, Trump has revived efforts to strike a new nuclear deal with Iran.
Just hours before Israel’s attack, the president on Thursday cautioned Israel against launching a strike while talks are ongoing. US officials have held several rounds of high-stakes nuclear talks with Iran in recent weeks, demanding that Tehran stop all uranium enrichment activity.
Iran has long claimed that its nuclear program is peaceful. It has said it wants to keep enriching uranium for civilian purposes, like building a nuclear reactor, and not for weapons.
“Zero nuclear weapons = we DO have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in an X post last month, setting out Tehran’s red lines in the talks.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/middleeast/iran-attacks-israel-intl-latam,Iran launches ‘hundreds’ of missiles at Israel following attack,2025-06-13 18:37:35,"Tehran launched retaliatory strikes against locations across Israel on Friday, following Israel’s attacks on Iranian military and nuclear targets.
Iran said Friday evening local time that it had fired “hundreds of various ballistic missiles” towards Israel, in what it called the “beginning” of its “crushing response.”
“Moments ago, with the launch of hundreds of various ballistic missiles toward the occupied territories, the operation of decisive response to the savage attack of the Zionist regime has begun,” Iran’s official news agency, IRNA, reported.
Iran claimed that it struck Israeli military-industrial centers used for producing missiles and other military equipment, adding that “field reports, satellite imagery and intercepted intelligence indicate that dozens of ballistic missiles effectively hit strategic targets.”
Following the barrage, Israel’s military claimed that Iran fired fewer than 100 missiles toward Israel and only landed a “few hits.” Some of those hits were from interception debris, Effie Defrin, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said in a video statement.
The United States helped Israel to intercept Iranian missiles on Friday evening, two Israeli sources have told CNN. Other countries in the region also supported Israeli air defenses, one source said, in a similar way to how they had done in previous Iranian attacks on Israel.
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said late on Friday that Iran had “crossed red lines” by firing missiles at civilian population centers and vowed it would pay a “very heavy price” for its actions.
Smoke and explosions in Tel Aviv
During the attack, CNN’s teams in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem could hear large explosions, and video from Tel Aviv showed incoming rockets and smoke rising amid the city’s skyscrapers.
At least 34 people have been injured in Gush Dan, according to the Israeli emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA). At least one woman is in critical condition and a man has been seriously injured, MDA added.
Gush Dan, which includes Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan, is Israel’s largest metropolitan area.
Information on injuries from individual hospitals across the country suggests that there could be dozens of injured people in hospitals, some of which have not yet been included in the MDA’s figures.
About an hour after the strikes began, authorities told Israelis they could leave their bomb shelters.
A CNN journalist took shelter with her neighbors approximately 100 meters from where a missile landed. As the projectile made impact, her group heard a noise similar to a jet engine, then a large explosion followed by a smaller one.
Images and video released by MDA showed civil defense workers surveying mangled cars and collapsed building facades in central Israel.
The Iranian barrage came after Israel launched a massive two-pronged attack on Iran early Friday morning local time, with strikes aimed at destroying Iranian nuclear sites and decapitating its military leadership in Tehran.
Israel’s attack culminated years of threats and days of heightened speculation – but was executed without the blessing of Israel’s closest ally: the United States. The Trump administration has stressed that Israel acted unilaterally and that Washington was “not involved.”
In a speech posted Friday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke directly to Iranians, saying that “Israel’s fight is not against the Iranian people,” but rather its government.
“More is on the way. The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker,” Netanyahu said.
In April 2024, Iran launched more than 300 projectiles – including around 170 drones and over 120 ballistic missiles – toward Israel, but “99%” of them were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense systems and its “partners,” according to the Israeli military.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/business/iran-israel-gas-prices-oil,Gas prices: What the Israel-Iran conflict means for your summer driving season,2025-06-13 17:03:39,"Israel’s unprecedented attack on Iran raises the specter of sharply higher gasoline prices, just as the summer driving season heats up.
Up until now, pump prices had been low and stable. Relatively cheap gas prices have helped drive down inflation and offset consumer concerns about sky-high tariffs.
While gas prices tend to rise mildly during the warmer months as people begin their summer vacations, everything has changed since Israel’s stunning strikes on Iran – an attack that Tehran has vowed to respond to. Analysts say the severity of that Iranian response, and whether it derails the flow of oil out of the Middle East, will help determine just how gasoline prices go.
Oil prices immediately spiked as the market braced for a wider conflict, one that endangers the region’s critical energy supplies. US crude spiked as much as 14% overnight, before pulling back.
As of midday on Friday, crude was up 6%, on track for its biggest one-day increase since April 2023. For the week, oil has surged by about 12%, the most since October 2022 when OPEC sharply cut oil production.
“We’re still at the tip of this situation, but Iran calling the strikes a declaration of war doesn’t bode well for the flow of oil,” said Patrick De Haan, vice president of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a fuel tracking platform.
De Haan told CNN that gasoline prices are likely to drift higher over the next few weeks, increasing by about 10 to 25 cents per gallon. The national average for regular gas stood at just $3.13 a gallon on Friday, according to AAA. That’s down from $3.16 a month ago and well below the year-ago level of $3.46.
But pump prices are likely to move significantly higher in the coming days because of the increase in crude prices.
“I expect gas prices will jump, but not back to record highs,” De Haan said. “But the risk is that we see Middle East incidents move beyond borders. Will the violence spread? Will the flow of oil be impacted?”
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil and gasoline prices skyrocketing in early 2022, eventually driving up gas prices to a record of $5.02 a gallon.
Thankfully, energy prices enter this crisis at relatively low levels.
Fears of a supply shock
There remains significant uncertainty over just how high gasoline and oil will go because Iran’s response is unclear.
Analysts warn that if Iran dramatically escalates the situation by attacking regional energy infrastructure or US military personnel, prices could spike much higher.
“Oil has already spiked… and its ultimate landing point will likely hinge on whether Iran revives the 2019 playbook and targets tankers, pipelines, and key energy facilities across the region,” Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.
The big fear is that Iran retaliates by targeting the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow body of water separating the Persian Gulf from global oceans, and the most critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Iran has in the past threatened to do just that.
“In the unlikely scenario of Iran disrupting flows through the Strait of Hormuz, we could see a significant supply shock with oil prices rising sharply,” Jorge León, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, wrote in a report on Friday.
That’s because about 21 million barrels of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz per day, accounting for about one-fifth of the world’s daily consumption, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
But Rystad Energy said that if Iran opts for a more “limited” response that only focuses on Israeli military sites, the oil market reaction could remain “contained and temporary.” And that in turn would limit how much gasoline prices increase.
A return of $100 oil?
Any effort to disrupt shipping through the Strait of Hormuz would also have to contend with the US Navy, which is positioned nearby in part due to such a threat.
Croft, a former CIA analyst, said it would be “extremely difficult for Iran to close the strait for an extended period given the presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain.”
Still, Croft noted that Iran could attack tankers and mine the waterway to disrupt traffic.
Goldman Sachs estimates that oil prices could blow past $100 a barrel if there is an “extended disruption” to the Strait of Hormuz, because such an unlikely event could prevent core OPEC producers, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, from ramping up production.
However, Goldman Sachs views a disruption to the Strait of Hormuz as “much less likely” and on Friday only slightly increased its summertime oil price forecast.
“We still assume no disruptions to oil supply in the Middle East,” Goldman Sachs strategists led by Daan Struyven, co-lead of the bank’s commodity research team, wrote in a report to clients.
How will OPEC respond?
But if oil prices continue spiking, several steps could be taken to help supply meet demand.
One option is that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations could accelerate recent production increases that began earlier this year.
“If oil is caught in the cross-fire,” RBC’s Croft said, “we anticipate that President Trump will seek OPEC spare barrels to try to keep a lid on prices and shield US consumers from the economic impact of the Middle East conflict.”
Goldman Sachs assumes that if Iranian oil exports plunge by 1.76 million barrels per day during the conflict, core OPEC+ production would make up half of the Iranian shortfall. In that scenario, Goldman Sachs estimates that Brent crude would climb above $90 a barrel before declining back to between $60 and $70 next year.
Emergency oil stockpiles
Another option: The United States and other major oil consumers could release emergency oil stockpiles, as they did in 2022. Former President Joe Biden aggressively drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to prevent gas prices from spiking even higher after Russia invaded Ukraine.
“We’re ready to act if needed,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said in a post earlier on Friday.
Birol said the IEA, which is an intergovernmental organization that coordinates the use of member states’ oil reserves, is “actively monitoring” the situation and noted that the group’s oil security system has more than 1.2 billion barrels of emergency oil stockpiles.
OPEC, which represents oil producing countries, strongly pushed back at those comments on Friday.
In a statement on X, OPEC’s secretary general argued that the IEA statement “raises false alarms and projects a sense of market fear through repeating the unnecessary need to potentially use oil emergency stocks.”
Still, releasing emergency oil is an option that Trump could at least hint at to cool off energy prices if the situation in the Middle East escalates.",['Matt Egan'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/politics/republicans-israel-support-analysis,Americans’ - and Republicans’ - increasingly complicated relationship with Israel,2025-06-13 16:50:44,"The president who promised to easily and quickly bring about peace has now found himself accounting for yet another major escalation. President Donald Trump had publicly discouraged Israel from striking Iran in recent days, as he pushed to instead secure a deal to curtail Iran’s nuclear program.
But it didn’t pan out. Israel launched a massive attack overnight that targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities and killed high-ranking officials – strikes that Trump told CNN by phone early Friday were “very successful.”
It all reinforces how the world we live in is much more complex than the one Trump pitched on the campaign trail.
And from a domestic perspective, the situation with Israel is arguably more complex than it has been in many decades.
Multiple indicators suggest Americans’ support for Israel has reached historic lows as its war in Gaza has dragged on. And while Republicans are much more likely to back Israel than Democrats, even that is getting more complicated – particularly as influential voices on the right voice skepticism of a hardline approach to Iran.
Much remains to shake out amid the historic escalation in the Middle East. Things will shift. There is a real question about whether Iran is even capable now of the kind of significant retaliation that could lead to a wider war.
But the US decisions that lie ahead aren’t as easy as they once might have seemed, politically speaking.
A Quinnipiac University poll released this week – ahead of Israel’s strikes – epitomized the shifting landscape.
Polls for decades have asked Americans to choose whether they sympathize more with Israelis or Palestinians, and Israel is almost always the runaway favorite. But this one showed Americans sided with the Israelis by a historically narrow margin: 37% to 32%.
After Hamas’ October 2023 terror attack on Israel, that margin had been 61-13% in the Israelis’ favor. So a 48-point edge has shrunk to five.
That’s not only the lowest advantage for Israel since Quinnipiac began polling this question in 2001, but it appears to be about the lowest since at least 1980 across multiple polls, according to data compiled by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.
Those findings, while telling, don’t strictly apply to a conflict between Israel and Iran. But it’s also clear that overall support for Israel has waned over the past year and a half.
To wit:
What was particularly striking about that last one: These views were almost completely nonpartisan. It was about 4 in 10 Democrats, independents and Republicans who said Israel’s business was none of ours.
That suggests that Trump’s injection of non-interventionism in the conservative movement has caught on, even as it relates to our most significant ally in the Middle East.
But it’s more than just non-interventionism; there are also plenty of signs that even Republicans have soured on Israel.
The Quinnipiac poll showed the percentage of Republicans who sympathized more with the Israelis than Palestinians dropping from 86% in October 2023 to 64% today. (Almost all of the shift was to a neutral position, rather than to the Palestinians.)
And the Pew poll showed unfavorable views of Israel among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents rising from 27% in 2022 to 37% in March. Most remarkably, right-leaning voters under the age of 50 were about evenly split in their views of Israel.
These modest but significant shifts have come as certain corners of the MAGA movement have adopted a more skeptical view of the American alliance with Israel and cautioned against a hardline approach to Iran.
Those tensions are perhaps best exemplified by an intense and ongoing feud between Fox News host Mark Levin and his former Fox colleague, Tucker Carlson.
Carlson on Friday morning went so far as to say the United States should decouple itself from Israel altogether. He said the Trump administration should “drop Israel. Let them fight their own wars.”
Carlson said the United States not only shouldn’t send troops, but that it shouldn’t provide any funding or weapons.
Also this week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard used her personal X account to promote a cryptic video. She urged people to “reject this path to nuclear war” and said certain “elite warmongers” were carelessly pushing us toward it, in the knowledge that they personally had nuclear shelters that others didn’t.
It’s not clear if Gabbard was alluding to the tensions in the Middle East – as opposed to, say, the war between Russia and Ukraine. But she has long advocated a softer approach to Iran. Back in 2020, while she was still a Democrat, she called Trump’s killing of a top Iranian commander an unconstitutional “act of war.”
Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana responded this week that Gabbard should “change her meds.”
In other words, this isn’t even simple on the right anymore. Trump leads a country and a movement that are increasingly torn about the path ahead.
He has landed firmly in Israel’s corner thus far. But very difficult decisions could lie ahead.",['Aaron Blake'],en

The two countries had been trading attacks since Israel launched “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13. The operation was aimed at stopping what Israel said was Tehran’s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons. Its targets included Iran’s main enrichment facility in Natanz and what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “the heart of Iran’s ballistic missiles program.”
Several of the most important men in Iran’s military and nuclear program were killed in Israel’s initial strikes. Among them were Iran’s highest-ranking military officer and the head of its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Iran, which insists its nuclear program is peaceful, began retaliatory strikes after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Israel would face “severe punishment.""
On Saturday, Trump ordered US warplanes to drop massive bombs on three nuclear sites inside Iran. “Our objective was the destruction of Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world’s No. 1 state sponsor of terror,” Trump said during his four-minute speech from the White House Cross Hall.
Iran retaliated Monday by firing about a dozen ballistic missiles at the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US military installation in the Middle East. But Tehran tipped both the United States and Qatar that the strike was coming, and air defenses were able to intercept all but one of the incoming Iranian missiles, according to US and Qatari officials. No deaths or injuries were reported in Qatar.
Trump announced the ceasefire deal hours later.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/middleeast/iran-nuclear-program-explainer-intl-dg,Does have Iran have nuclear weapons? What to know about their nuclear program,2025-06-13 00:00:00,"After decades of threats, Israel on Friday launched an audacious attack on Iran, targeting its nuclear sites, scientists and military leaders.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation had “struck at the head of Iran’s nuclear weaponization program.”
But international assessments, including by the US intelligence community, say that Iran’s nuclear program isn’t currently weaponized. Tehran has also repeatedly insisted it isn’t building a bomb.
Still, that doesn’t mean it couldn’t if it chose to.
Iran has spent decades developing its nuclear program and sees it as a source of national pride and sovereignty. It maintains the program is solely for peaceful energy purposes and plans to build additional nuclear power plants to meet domestic energy needs and free up more oil for export.
Nuclear plants require a fuel called uranium – and according to the UN nuclear watchdog, no other country has the kind of uranium that Iran currently does without also having a nuclear weapons program.
That has fueled suspicions that Iran isn’t being fully transparent about its intentions. Tehran has used its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium as a bargaining chip in talks with the United States, repeatedly saying it would get rid of it if US-led sanctions are lifted.
So, what exactly is uranium’s role in a nuclear weapon, and how far is Iran from weaponizing its program? Here’s what you need to know.
When did Iran’s nuclear program start?
The US launched a nuclear program with Iran in 1957. Back then, the Western-friendly monarch – the Shah – ruled Iran and the two countries were still friends.
With backing from the US, Iran started developing its nuclear power program in the 1970s. But the US pulled its support when the Shah was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Since the revolution, which transformed Iran into an Islamic Republic, Western nations have worried the country could use its nuclear program to produce atomic weapons using highly enriched uranium.
Iran has maintained that it does not seek to build nuclear weapons. It is a party to the UN’s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), under which it has pledged not to develop a bomb.
Here’s where its nuclear facilities are located.
Why is the program so controversial?
At the heart of the controversy over Iran’s nuclear program is its enrichment of uranium – a process used to produce fuel for power plants that, at higher levels, can also be used to make a nuclear bomb.
In the early 2000s, international inspectors announced that they had found traces of highly enriched uranium at an Iranian plant in Natanz. Iran temporarily halted enrichment, but resumed it in 2006, insisting it was allowed under its agreement with the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
It prompted years of international sanctions against Iran.
After years of negotiations, Iran and six world powers in 2015 agreed to a nuclear deal that limited Iran’s nuclear threat in return for lighter sanctions.
The deal required Iran to keep its uranium enrichment levels at no more than 3.67%, down from near 20%, dramatically reduce its uranium stockpile, and phase out its centrifuges, among other measures.
Uranium isn’t bomb-grade until it’s enriched to 90% purity. And nuclear power plants that generate electricity use uranium that is enriched to between 3.5% and 5%.
Does Iran have nuclear weapons?
It’s unclear how close Iran might be to actually building a nuclear bomb, if at all, but it has made significant progress in producing its key ingredient: highly enriched uranium. In recent years, it has sharply reduced the time needed to reach weapons-grade levels – now requiring just about a week to produce enough for one bomb.
In 2018, Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and initiated new sanctions on the regime to cripple its economy.
Tehran in turn said it would stop complying with parts of the agreement, and started increasing uranium enrichment and uranium stockpiles, and using advanced centrifuges.
It removed all of the IAEA equipment previously installed for surveillance and monitoring activities.
The Biden administration then kicked off more than a year of indirect negotiations with Iran aimed at reviving the deal, but those broke down in 2022.
In 2023, the IAEA said uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity – close to bomb-grade levels – were found at an Iranian nuclear facility. Its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had also grown to 128.3 kilograms, the highest level then documented.
And last year, the US shortened Iran’s so-called “breakout time” – the amount of time needed to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon – “to one or two weeks.”
An IAEA report sent to member states late last month said Iran’s stock of 60% purity enriched uranium had now grown to 408 kilograms. That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick.
The IAEA has long accused Iran of violating its non-proliferation obligations, but on Thursday – for the first time in almost 20 years – its board passed a resolution officially declaring Iran in breach of those obligations. Iran promised to respond by escalating its nuclear activities.
What exactly is enriched uranium?
Enrichment is a process that increases the amount of uranium-235, a special type of uranium used to power nuclear reactors or, in much higher amounts, to make nuclear weapons.
Natural uranium is mostly uranium‑238 – about 99.3%, which isn’t good for power or bombs. Only about 0.7% is uranium‑235, the part needed to release energy.
For nuclear energy use, that tiny amount of useful uranium-235 needs to be concentrated. To do this, uranium is first turned into a gas, then spun at high speeds in machines called centrifuges. These machines help separate uranium-235 from the more common uranium-238. That is what enrichment is.
Uranium used in nuclear power plants is typically enriched to about 3.67%. To make a nuclear bomb, it needs to be enriched to around 90%. Iran has enriched uranium to 60% – not enough for a bomb, but a major step closer to weapons-grade material.
Centrifuges are essential for enriching uranium. The more advanced the centrifuge, the faster and more efficiently it can separate uranium-235 from uranium-238 – shortening the time needed to produce nuclear fuel or, potentially, weapons-grade material. Iran has spent decades improving its centrifuge technology, starting with its first-generation IR-1 model in the late 1980s. Today, it operates thousands of machines, including advanced models like the IR-6 and IR-9.
According to the Arms Control Association, Iran’s current centrifuge capacity could allow it to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in less than two weeks.
How has Iran’s nuclear program been hit?
Israel says it’s targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in its attack.
Natanz, the facility at the heart of Iran’s nuclear ambitions, was engulfed in flames on Friday, according to social media images geolocated by CNN and Iranian state television coverage.
The nuclear complex there, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of the capital Tehran, is considered Iran’s largest uranium enrichment facility. Analysts say the site is used to develop and assemble centrifuges for uranium enrichment, a key technology that turns uranium into nuclear fuel.
The IAEA said three nuclear sites, Fordow, Isfahan and Bushehr, had not been impacted.
Six of Iran’s nuclear scientists were also killed in Israel’s strikes, Iranian state-affiliated Tasnim news agency said.
Iran has spent years strengthening its nuclear structures against the threat of military strikes, which will make it difficult to comprehensively destroy them, military experts have told CNN.
Some facilities are buried deep underground to put them out of reach of Israel’s weapons.","['Mostafa Salem', 'Helen Regan', 'Lou Robinson']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/middleeast/israel-attack-iran-nuclear-program-explainer-intl,Israel hit Iran’s nuclear program - and Iran hit back. Here’s what we know,2025-06-13 14:47:20,"Iran and Israel have continued to trade deadly blows into the weekend, following an unprecedented Israeli attack on Friday aimed at destroying Tehran’s nuclear program and decapitating its military leadership.
Iran launched multiple waves of missiles and drones toward Israel throughout the day on Saturday. Simultaneously, Israel undertook new airstrikes against Iranian targets, with Iran claiming that Israel set a critical natural gas field ablaze, as well as an oil depot.
The skies above Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem were lit up Saturday by incoming missiles, drones, interceptor rockets and explosions. Both sides have threatened more to come.
Israel’s military and intelligence operation against Iran early Friday was unprecedented in scale and scope, prompting Iran to vow a “crushing response” as the escalating conflict risks pulling the Middle East into a wider war.
Here’s what you need to know.
Israel and Iran trade missile attacks
Shortly before sunrise in Iran on Friday, Israel launched the first strikes of its operation against the regime’s nuclear program.
That operation, called “Rising Lion,” had two prongs: Heavy airstrikes against at least one of Iran’s enrichment sites, and more targeted strikes in Tehran to decapitate the regime’s military leadership. It aimed to halt what Israel said was Tehran’s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons.
At a United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday, Iran’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani said the Israeli strikes had killed at least 78 people and injured more than 320, mostly civilians.
Israel’s attack came after years of threats and days of heightened speculation – but without the United States’ blessing. The administration of US President Donald Trump stressed that Israel acted unilaterally and that Washington was “not involved.”
Iran hit back on Friday evening, launching what state media said were “hundreds” of ballistic missiles as part of a “crushing response.” Iran claimed that it struck Israeli military-industrial centers used for producing missiles and other military equipment.
But Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Iran had “crossed red lines” by firing missiles at civilian population centers and vowed it would pay a “very heavy price.”
At least three people were killed in Israel and dozens injured by Iranian strikes, Israeli authorities said.
Overnight into Saturday, Israel and Iran continued to trade deadly missile attacks, unleashing destruction in both countries and forcing residents to flee to underground shelters. In Israel, emergency crews launched search and rescue efforts on Saturday, as people remained trapped under destroyed homes and buildings, while explosions were heard in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The Israeli Air Force said it carried out a new wave of strikes hitting defense arrays in Tehran overnight and the Israeli military said it struck two Iranian air force bases used for missile and drone operations.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s operation would continue “for as many days as it takes” to eliminate Iran’s nuclear threat. Tehran, which insists its nuclear program is peaceful, says it has “no option but to respond.”
Where and when did Israel strike?
Iran has not seen such a widespread assault in a single day since the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Israel targeted locations all across the capital city, Tehran, and around the country.
The first explosions tore through Tehran at around 3.30 a.m. Friday (8 p.m. ET Thursday). Videos geolocated by CNN showed flames and smoke billowing from buildings across the city.
Residents of Tehran were blindsided. Many did not expect Israel to strike so swiftly. “I didn’t know what was happening. It was really scary,” a 17-year-old Iranian told CNN, requesting anonymity due to safety concerns.
Shortly after explosions rocked Tehran, Israel struck elsewhere in the country. Israel’s military said it used jets to strike “dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.”
An explosion was reported at Iran’s main enrichment facility in Natanz, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Tehran.
The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed that Natanz had been hit, but said it had not observed an increase in radiation levels in the area. Israel later claimed that it had hit a second nuclear facility in Isfahan.
On Saturday, flames erupted at Iran’s South Pars gas field – the world’s largest natural gas field – according to reports in Iranian state media.
Video footage circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows a large blaze and plumes of smoke rising from the gas field in Iran’s southern Bushehr province.
The oil field was hit by an Israeli drone strike, according to the Iranian state media reports.
Later, Iranian state media reported that an Israeli strike hit the Shahran oil depot and a separate fuel tank near Tehran, causing a large fire.
What did Israel say?
Israel will “strike every target” of Iran’s regime, Netanyahu said in a video address on Saturday as his country and Iran continued to trade blows.
In the “very near future, you will see Israeli planes, the Israeli Air Force, our brave pilots, above the skies of Tehran,” Netanyahu said.
“We will strike every site and every target of the Ayatollah’s regime,” he warned.
Netanyahu had earlier said Israel would continue its operation for as long as it takes “to remove these threats.”
Netanyahu claimed that Iran had in recent years produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine nuclear weapons.
“Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year, it could be within a few months,” he said. “This is a clear and present danger to Israel’s survival.”
“Tehran is burning,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz posted to X on Saturday accompanying a video showing a large blaze near the Iranian city.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said it had destroyed Iran’s ballistic missile launch sites and stockpiles.
Addressing the Iranian people directly in a video released Friday night local time, Netanyahu warned “more is on the way,” urging civilians to “stand up and let your voices be heard.”
He said Israel’s fight is not against them but against the Iranian government.
Who did Israel kill?
Several of the most important men in Iran’s military and its nuclear program were killed in Israel’s strikes.
Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, head of the secretive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was the highest-profile of those killed.
Israel also said it killed Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces; Ali Shamkhani, a close aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC’s air force.
Nine scientists and experts involved in Iran’s nuclear program were also killed, Israel’s military said. This includes Ali Bakhouei Karimi, Mansour Asgari, and Saeed Barji — experts in mechanics, physics and materials engineers respectively, the IDF said.
How has the US responded?
The Trump administration – which has been pursuing a diplomatic path with Iran in recent weeks – sought to distance itself from Israel’s attack.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel’s actions were “unilateral.” Although Israel notified the US ahead of its strikes, Rubio said the US was “not involved” in the attack.
“Our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” he added. Earlier this week, the US had made efforts to arrange the departure of non-essential personnel from various countries in the Middle East, leading to speculation that an Israeli attack on Iran could be imminent.
Nonetheless, the US helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles on Friday evening, two Israeli sources have told CNN. Other countries in the region also supported Israeli air defenses, one source said.
President Trump urged Iran to agree to a new nuclear deal “before there is nothing left,” suggesting that follow-up Israeli attacks on the country would be “even more brutal.”
Trump said he had given Iran “chance after chance” to make a deal. “JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.
What happened to the last Iran nuclear deal?
Under a 2015 nuclear deal struck by former US President Barack Obama, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to drastically limit its number of centrifuges and cap uranium enrichment at levels far below those required to make weapons, in exchange for sanctions relief.
But during his first term as president in 2018, Trump withdrew from the JCPOA, saying the “rotten structure” of the agreement was not enough to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. He ramped up sanctions on Iran and threatened to sanction any country that helped the regime to obtain nuclear weapons.
In his second term, Trump has revived efforts to strike a new nuclear deal with Iran. Just hours before Israel’s strikes, the president cautioned Israel against launching an attack while US-Iran talks are ongoing.
“As long as I think there is an agreement, I don’t want them going in because that would blow it. Might help it, actually, but also could blow it,” Trump said.",['Christian Edwards'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/middleeast/iran-response-israeli-strikes-intl-cmd,A weakened Iran has few options for striking back after Israel’s devastating blows,2025-06-13 11:49:53,"In the face of Israel’s far-reaching strikes Friday, it’s not clear that Iran – its longtime foe – has the capacity to muster the furious response that might be expected.
Israel has once again demonstrated it is the pre-eminent military and intelligence power in the Middle East, heedless to civilian casualties and the diplomatic impact of its actions on its allies.
As with their remarkable operation to decapitate their northern opponent – the Iranian proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah – the overnight operation has the hallmarks of months or even years of preparation. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have been faced with using this capability now, or losing it, as diplomacy kicked in during a sixth round of nuclear talks scheduled for this weekend between the United States and Iran in Oman.
Iran is now left counting its far-reaching wounds. Images from across Tehran show apartment blocks hit, it seems, in specific rooms – suggesting the pinpoint targeting of individuals, likely through tracking cellphones. Iran has lost its top three active-duty commanders, as well as a leading voice in nuclear talks, overnight, but as the dust clears it may emerge more have been hit, and the survivors will likely be concerned they, too, could still be targeted.
This will slow and complicate any Iranian response. As will the damage the Iranians continue to sustain. A raid by Israel in October took out a large tranche of Iran’s air defenses. Israel’s military said Friday that it had destroyed dozens of radars and surface-to-air missile launchers in strikes by fighter jets on aerial defense arrays in western Iran. The Iranian atomic energy agency confirmed that the nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz had also been damaged, but it’s not yet clear to what extent.
In the days ahead, Israel’s superior intelligence apparatus will search for targets of opportunity - commanders and equipment changing location, or the movement of materiel to facilitate a response – and continue to strike.
Such a wide-ranging assault was possible only because Hezbollah – Iran’s second-strike capability if their nuclear apparatus was hit - had been dismantled over a ruthless but effective months-long campaign last summer. This is beginning to look like a months-long Israeli plan to remove a regional threat.
The risks remain high. Iran could now try to race for the nuclear bomb. But its faltering defenses and clear, humiliating infiltration by Israel’s intelligence, make that a long shot. Rushing to build a nuclear weapon is no simple task, especially under fire, with your key leadership at risk of pinpoint strikes. Netanyahu may have calculated that the risk of an Iranian nuclear breakout was depleted, and manageable with yet more military might.
There is another victim of the overnight barrage: the Trump administration’s standing as a geopolitical power.
There may be suggestions from Trump advocates in the hours ahead that the Israeli assault was part of a wider masterplan to weaken Iran ahead of more diplomacy. But, in reality, a simpler truth is revealed: Israel had no trust in the United States to implement a deal with Iran that would remove its nuclear ambitions.
Despite public pleading by US President Donald Trump for it to hold off, Israel went ahead with the most significant attack on Iran since its war with Iraq in the 1980s. Israel neither cared for or feared Trump’s response, and is apparently prepared to risk fighting on without US support.
That is perhaps another indictment of Iran’s ability to respond now. Israel is less bothered by what it can do. Israel’s operation against Hezbollah provides reason for it to be confident (but also should stir anxieties about hubris and overreach). Israel has likely hit the vast majority of its key targets already, to maximize the advantage of surprise, and the extent of that damage will take days to be revealed.
What of proliferation now? There is a lot that we do not know about Iran’s nuclear program. Israel may have known a lot more. But we are now in a binary moment where the strikes on the Natanz facility may either herald its end, or its race to completion – in the form of a nuclear weapon. Iran has always insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, but the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog on Thursday declared it in breach of its non-proliferation obligations, prompting Tehran to promise escalatory action.
In the moment of its greatest weakness, the Islamic Republic will struggle to project the regional swagger it has maintained for decades. It may feel it is unable to grasp diplomacy with the US as its way out, without looking even weaker. It appears unable to hit Israel back proportionately, so may look to strike asymmetrically, if possible.
In the immediate confusion, one basic fact is clear: Israel is acting in the Middle East now unimpeded by allies, unafraid of wider risks, and - at times brutally - seeking to alter regional dynamics for decades to come.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Israel-Iran
Israel has launched an unprecedented attack on Iran that targeted its nuclear program and military. Israel’s 200 fighter jets hit dozens of targets and reportedly damaged the country’s primary nuclear enrichment facility. Nuclear scientists and key military leaders — including the commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran’s highest-ranking military officer and an aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — were killed. During the “large-scale strike,” Iranian civilians reportedly felt the ground shaking and heard repeated explosions. Multiple videos showed flames and smoke billowing from buildings across Tehran. In response, Khamenei has vowed that Israel will face “severe punishment for the attacks.” Israeli citizens have already begun to prepare by closing schools and securing medical facilities. Overnight, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israeli territory in what is expected to be the first stage of a much larger counter-attack.
2. Air India crash
At least 290 people died when an Air India jet crashed soon after departure from an airport in Ahmedabad, India, yesterday. The plane, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, was en route to London when it crashed, hitting a hostel for doctors. The death toll includes 241 passengers and crew on Flight AI171 as well as people on the ground. Only one passenger, a British national, survived. Three officials from India’s National Disaster Response Force said the flight recorder had been located. According to Boeing, this was the first major incident involving a 787 Dreamliner since the aircraft entered into service in 2011. However, the aerospace giant has had to deal with numerous safety incidents in the last several years, including fatal crashes and quality issues.
3. DOGE cuts
The GOP-led House narrowly passed some of the federal spending cuts that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sought to make unilaterally. The vote on Thursday to cancel $9.4 billion in federal spending for foreign aid and public broadcasting looked like it was going to fail. Then, Rep. Nick LaLota of New York and Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, both of whom had initially voted no, changed their votes in the final moments. If approved by the Senate, the legislation would cut $8.3 billion for US Agency for International Development (USAID) programs that provide humanitarian assistance, including health care, disaster aid and hunger relief. The bill would also slash $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. Full Congressional approval would codify the DOGE cuts into law so that they can’t be reversed by the next administration, and would help to insulate the Trump administration from legal challenges.
4. Immigration protests
Hours after a district court judge ruled that President Donald Trump had unlawfully federalized thousands of members of California’s National Guard and ordered him to return control of the troops to the state, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals put that ruling on pause. California Gov. Gavin Newsom had sued Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after the president called the troops into federal service to quell the anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. In his ruling, senior US District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump had not satisfied any of the requirements that must be met to call up a state’s National Guard and that the demonstrations did not constitute an insurrection. A panel of three judges from the 9th Circuit will hold a hearing on the issue next week.
5. Extreme weather
Torrential rains swept through San Antonio, Texas, on Thursday, triggering flash floods that swept away 15 vehicles and claimed the lives of at least five people. The rains were so sudden and heavy that the San Antonio River rose from about 3 feet to over 25 feet in just two hours. Ten people had to be rescued from trees and bushes about one mile from where they entered the water, a San Antonio Fire Department official said. Authorities are continuing to search for two people who are still missing.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/business/oil-prices-markets-israel-iran-attack-intl-hnk,Oil prices jump 7% and stocks drop as Israel-Iran tensions escalate,2025-06-13 00:00:00,"Oil prices surged, stocks dropped and investors flocked to safe havens like gold on Friday after tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, stoking concerns of a broader conflict in the region.
The price of oil surged Friday in the market’s largest single-day increase in years after Israel attacked Iran, reflecting fears that a wider conflict in the Middle East could lead to serious energy supply disruptions.
US oil surged 7.26%, settling at roughly $72.98 per barrel Friday. Brent gained 7%, settling at around $74.23 per barrel. US oil and Brent had surged as much as 14% and 13%, respectively, earlier in the day.
Those were the biggest single-day gains for the oil benchmarks since March 2022, weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The oil benchmarks also posted their biggest weekly gains since October 2022.
The surge illustrates “both immediate supply concerns and a growing sense that negative headlines could extend the timeline for escalation unlike the prior Israel-Iran episode,” Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at Pepperstone, a financial services firm, wrote in a research note.
Meanwhile, US stocks fell, sending investors retreating to traditional safe haven investments like gold, which rose about 1.4% to $3,433 per troy ounce. The US dollar slightly strengthened.
The Dow closed lower by 770 points, or 1.79%, on Friday after Iran said it had retaliated. The S&P 500 had dropped 1.13% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.3%.
The S&P 500, which had been hovering near an all-time high, closed the week in the red and snapped a two-week winning streak.
Stocks turned sharply lower after reports that Iran has fired “hundreds of various ballistic missiles” towards Israel, in what it called the “beginning” of its “crushing response” to Israeli attacks on the country on Friday morning.
“Moments ago, with the launch of hundreds of various ballistic missiles toward the occupied territories, the operation of decisive response to the savage attack of the Zionist regime has begun,” Iran’s official news agency, IRNA, reported.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, surged 19%.
Israel-Iran turmoil roils markets
Shares in airlines and travel companies fell on Friday amid the turmoil in the Middle East.
United Airlines (UAL) was lower by 4.4%, Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 3.8% and American Airlines (AAL) dropped by 4.9%. Shares in European airlines tumbled, too: Easyjet fell 3%, British Airways parent IAG fell 3.7% and Lufthansa dropped 2.8%.
Expedia Group (EXPE), a travel company, fell 3.5%. Shares in cruise ships dropped. Royal Caribbean (RCL) fell 2.9%, Norwegian (NCLH) fell 5% and Carnival (CCL) dropped 4.9%.
Meanwhile, defense contractors jumped higher. Lockheed Martin (LMT) gained 3.7% and and General Dynamics (GD) rose 1.1%.
Early on Friday, Israel launched an unprecedented attack against Iran’s nuclear and missile facilities, killing at least two of Iran’s top military commanders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address that the “targeted military operation” is expected to continue for “many days.”
“This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,” Netanyahu said.
A state of emergency had been declared in Israel in anticipation of an Iranian retaliation, which appears to have begun. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel will face “severe punishment” for the attacks.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not involved in the Israeli operation and warned Iran against targeting US interests or personnel.
President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that Israel’s attacks on Iran are “great for the market” because it means Iran won’t have a nuclear weapon.
“I think ultimately, it would be great for the market because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. It will be great for the market — should be the greatest thing ever for the market. Iran won’t have a nuclear weapon that was a great threat to humanity,” he told the newspaper in a phone call.
Oil prices spike higher
Investors are concerned about how a retaliation by Iran may play out, whether the US may be targeted and whether a critical oil transport route may be disrupted.
If the conflict eliminates Iranian oil from the market, oil prices could spike by about $7.50 a barrel, according to Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, a consulting firm.
“Iran knows full well that Trump is focused on lower energy prices and actions by Iran that impact Middle East supply and consequently raise oil prices damage Trump politically,” he said.
The bigger fear now is an even broader conflict that impacts the flow of oil from the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical chokepoint for oil supplies on the planet.
“Should oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz be affected, we could see $100 oil,” Lipow said.
OPEC on Friday pushed back on suggestions that surging oil prices after Israel’s attack on Iran could require the release of emergency oil stockpiles.
OPEC’s secretary general said in a statement on X that there are “currently no developments in supply or market dynamics that warrant unnecessary measures.”
Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, told CNN that the OPEC statement is “consistent with their posture, which is to hunker down, lay low and hope this blows over.”
A rise in global oil prices could also reignite inflation, complicating the outlook for policymakers like the Federal Reserve.
“Any rise in energy inflation would be another reason for central banks to proceed cautiously with cutting interest rates, and for the Fed to remain on the sidelines for now,” analysts at Capital Economics said in a Friday note. Fed policymakers are set to meet next week to discuss the economic outlook and interest rates.
McNally at Rapidan Energy Group also told CNN the oil market had been “complacent about the risk of geopolitical disruptions” from the region.
“With Israel having commenced attacks against Iran, we expect significantly more risk premium to come into the price of crude in the coming days,” he said.
Iran’s preparation for a military response “raises the risk of not just disruptions but of contagion in other neighboring oil producing nations too,” Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at Phillip Nova, told Reuters.
“Although Trump has shown reluctance to participate, US involvement could further raise concerns,” she said.","['John Liu', 'Matt Egan', 'John Towfighi']",en

Their deaths will send shockwaves through the nation’s military establishment and could seriously hamper the Islamic Republic’s ability to respond to Israel’s attacks. Here’s what you need to know about them.
Major General Hossein Salami
As the head of the secretive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major General Hossein Salami, was one of the most powerful men in Iran, overseeing its most potent military arm and reporting directly to its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Born in 1960, according to a US sanctions docket, Salami had headed the secretive and IRGC since 2019.
The position saw him helming one of the most powerful tools wielded by the Iranian state, which has been instrumental in crushing dissent at home and projecting Iran’s power abroad.
Analysts say the IRGC funds and supports a vast network of militias across the region which it uses to strike at US and other military personnel across the Middle East.
The IRGC is also believed to provide materials and support to Yemen’s Houthis, enabling the group to strike international shipping in the Red Sea and launch missiles and drones at Israel.
Salami was at the helm of the IRGC when Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in April and October last year, in the first direct strikes by Iran on Israeli territory.
In footage released by Iranian state media in January, Salami was seen inspecting what the media said was an underground military facility that had played a role in those attacks.
Wearing a green military uniform and short beard, Salami took the salute of soldiers in the cavernous underground complex and walked over the United States and Israel flags on the ground.
The site was now manufacturing “new special missiles,” semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News reported.
Salami was head of the IRGC when it shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet shortly after it took off from Tehran’s international airport, killing all 176 people on board.
An unnamed IRGC commander of the Tor M1 surface-to-air missile defense system that shot down the plane was sentenced to 13 years in prison, according to Iran’s Mehr news outlet.
CNN’s security analyst Beth Sanner said that removing Salami is akin to taking out the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff: “You can imagine what Americans would do,” she said.
Major General Mohammad Bagheri
Since 2016 Mohammad Bagheri had served as the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, which IISS estimated could call on more than 500,000 active personnel.
The General Staff is “the most senior military body in Iran, which implements policy and monitors and coordinates activities within the armed forces”, according to a US Treasury document laying out sanctions against Bagheri in 2019.
Bagheri was sanctioned along with nine others close to Ayatollah Khamenei “who have for decades oppressed the Iranian people, exported terrorism, and advanced destabilizing policies around the world,” the document said.
Photos published by Iran’s Tasnim news outlet showed him allegedly meeting with Iranian troops fighting on the ground alongside government forces in Syria in 2017.
In April Bagheri met Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud in Tehran, in a rare visit by a senior Saudi royal to the Islamic Republic.
The next month Reuters reported that during the meeting the Saudi defense minister had delivered a warning to Bagheri: take President Donald Trump’s offer to negotiate a nuclear agreement seriously because it presents a way to avoid the risk of war with Israel.
Ali Shamkhani
Ali Shamkhani was a close aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and represented Tehran at talks which sealed a landmark agreement to restore diplomatic ties with foe Saudi Arabia.
Iranian state TV network IRINN confirmed his death following Israel’s unprecedented strikes on Friday.
Shamkhani served as the country’s top national security official for a decade from 2013, and before that served in a number of important roles, including in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the ministry of defense.
He had been a rising star of Iranian diplomacy, well known in foreign-policy circles in Washington and Europe.
Shamkhani represented Iran in China-brokered talks with Saudi officials that led to the two countries agreeing to re-establish diplomatic ties after years of hostility.
But he was abruptly replaced in mid-2023.
The former national security chief was ambitious, experts say, and had an extensive portfolio. He ran for president in 2001 to held key posts in the IRGC and the defense ministry. Some analysts suggested at the time that Khamenei may have thought him too ambitious.
Still, he remained a close aide to the supreme leader, and gave advice as Iran re-entered nuclear talks with the administration of US President Donald Trump.
In April, days before talks with the US, he warned Tehran could expel UN nuclear inspectors and cease cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if it feels under threat.
Amir Ali Hajizadeh
The death of Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC’s Air Force, is a major blow to Tehran.
Hajizadeh headed the country’s missile program, which was involved in defending the country’s air space and carrying out attacks overseas.
Hajizadeh was the mastermind of Iran’s previous attack on Israel in April 2024 as well as the missile attack on a US base in Iraq in 2020.
The Israeli military said Hajizadeh was killed alongside other senior air force leaders in a strike as they gathered at an underground command center.","['Ross Adkin', 'Tamar Michaelis', 'Nadeen Ebrahim']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike-us-diplomacy,Trump didn’t want Israel to strike Iran but they did it anyway,2025-06-13 02:12:24,"In the hours before Israeli warplanes carried out an attack on Iran early Friday, raising fresh fears of all-out war in the region, President Donald Trump made clear it was an outcome he hoped to avoid.
“I don’t want them going in because, I mean, that would blow it,” he said, referring to his diplomatic efforts to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
The fact Israel went in anyway – without any US involvement, and against the president’s publicly stated wishes – now thrusts Trump into one of the biggest tests of his young presidency. After promising as a candidate to end foreign wars and keep American troops out of faraway conflicts, his ability to avoid getting mired in a new Middle East war now faces reality.
By his own telling, the strikes risk scuttling his attempts at diplomacy with Tehran, even as his top envoy Steve Witkoff was preparing to depart for Oman for another round of talks this weekend. Trump said early Friday his offer for diplomacy was still open, even as Iran vowed retribution for the killing of most of its top military leaders.
“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,’ but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
“Certain Iranian hardliner’s spoke bravely, but they didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!” the president went on. “There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end. Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.”
Whether Trump and Witkoff are successful in using the Israeli strikes as leverage for their diplomatic efforts with Iran remained an open question. Even before the Israeli strike, Trump had begun expressing doubts about Tehran’s willingness to reach a deal. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Israel of “harsh punishment” following Friday’s attack.
After months of simmering tension, the strikes could darken the pall over Trump’s already tense relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he urged as recently as this week to hold off on a strike. Trump did not mention Netanyahu in his statement, and there was no announcement of a phone call between the men.
Trump offered no signals in the immediate aftermath of the attacks that he was prepared to use American military assets to help defend Israel from expected Iranian reprisal, as his predecessor Joe Biden did when Israel and Iran exchanged fire last year.
Instead, the focus of public messaging from the US administration was on protecting the tens of thousands American personnel in the Middle East, and warning Iran not to drag the US into the fray.
In his warning to Iran on Friday, Trump implied the US would provide Israel with more military equipment – “Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come,” he wrote – but he stopped short of saying American resources would come to Israel’s defense. Trump is set to meet with his National Security Council later on Friday morning.
Without American assistance, Israel’s air defenses could be unable to withstand a major Iranian onslaught.
Trump, who ran on a promise to end wars and bring about peace, will now find himself caught between competing crosscurrents from within his own party. Many Republicans were quick to offer their support to Israel on Thursday, including Sen. Lindsey Graham – a longtime Iran hawk – who wrote on X: “Game on.”
Yet Trump has never quite adopted that strain of his party’s foreign policy, particularly in his second term. His administration is stacked with officials, starting with his vice president, who take a deeply skeptical view of US military involvement abroad without express American interests on the line.
Still, for all the complicated dynamics for Trump to now sort through, the attack hardly came as a surprise to the president and his team.
Even as he was speaking from the East Room on Thursday, the president and his aides were aware the strikes were likely coming soon, sources said, despite Trump’s repeated attempts at urging Netanyahu to hold off.
As the strikes were getting underway, Trump was appearing on the South Lawn at a congressional picnic. He returned to the West Wing afterward to huddle with top officials, according to a White House official and other sources.
Afterward, a terse statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to put distance between the US and any role in the attack.
“Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” read the statement, which was distributed by the White House.
“Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners,” Rubio continue. “Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”
Devoid of even boilerplate language offering support for Israel and its defense, the statement made clear: this would be Israel’s conflict, not Trump’s.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/middleeast/israel-iran-strikes-intl-hnk,"Netanyahu says Israel launched operation Rising Lion, hits Iran’s nuclear program and military leadership",2025-06-13 00:00:00,"Israel struck at the heart of Iran’s nuclear, missile and military complex early Friday, in an unprecedented attack that has killed several of Iran’s most powerful figures and plunges the wider Middle East into dangerous new territory.
The strikes on Iran’s nuclear program and senior military leaders could be a turning point in the long-running conflict, with Israel braced for a major Iranian retaliation – and the threat of a wider regional war breaking out now a real risk.
Later Friday morning, that retaliation appeared to be underway after Israel’s military said Iran had launched more than 100 drones toward Israel, and that Israel had begun “intercepting” them outside of its borders.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Israel will face “severe punishment” for the attacks, and confirmed that a number of Iranian commanders and scientists had been killed. Iran’s Armed Forces spokesperson said both the United States and Israel would “pay dearly,” while Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the attack “a declaration of war.”
The US was not involved in the strikes, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, noting that Israel had “advised” the US that it believed the “action was necessary for its self-defense.” On Thursday, President Donald Trump had warned of the possibility of “massive conflict” in the Middle East that could take place “soon.”
Posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, early Friday, Trump urged Iran to agree to a nuclear deal “before there is nothing left,” suggesting that subsequent Israeli attacks on the country could be “even more brutal.”
Washington has long sought to limit Tehran’s nuclear capacity, with the most recent negotiations in Rome last month ending with no agreement. A sixth round of US-Iran talks had been scheduled for Sunday in Oman – it’s not clear if it will go ahead.
Israel’s strikes came shortly after Tehran said that it would ramp up its nuclear activities due to the International Atomic Energy Agency passing a resolution saying that the country was not in compliance with its non-proliferation commitments, senior US officials told CNN.
In a televised address to the nation early Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military operation had “struck at the head of Iran’s nuclear weaponization program” and targets included Iran’s main enrichment facility in Natanz, Iranian nuclear scientists, and Iran’s ballistic missiles program.
“Moments ago, Israel launched operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival,” Netanyahu said.
“This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”
Repeated explosions could be heard in the capital, Tehran, terrifying its residents, and multiple videos geolocated by CNN showed flames and smoke billowing from buildings across the city. Iran’s airspace has also been closed, its civil aviation authority said.
An Israeli military statement later Friday said Israeli fighter jets had also completed a “large-scale strike” on aerial defense arrays in western Iran. “As part of the strikes, dozens of radars and surface-to-air missile launchers were destroyed,” it said.
Several of Iran’s most powerful men have been killed, according to Iranian authorities and state media. They included Gen. Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of the country’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces and the country’s highest-ranking military officer.
Also among the dead are Iran’s former national security chief Ali Shamkhani – a key adviser to Khamenei who served as secretary of the National Security Council for almost a decade – and Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the IRGC’s Air Force, who was killed alongside two other air force commanders. Six of Iran’s nuclear scientists, were killed, state affiliated Tasnim news agency said.
Khamenei appointed new commanders on Friday to head key military entities, including Brig. Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, the new head of the IRGC.
Friday’s strikes suggest Netanyahu saw a window of opportunity to meet Israel’s longstanding objective of obliterating Iran’s nuclear program. Iran is in its weakest military position in decades following crippling economic sanctions, previous Israeli strikes on its air defenses and decimation of its most powerful regional proxies, including Hezbollah.
US officials had previously told CNN that Israeli strikes on Iran would be a brazen break with Trump’s approach on the Middle East.
Trump told CNN on Friday that the US supports Israel and called the strikes on Iran “a very successful attack.”
Several countries voiced alarm and condemnation over Israel’s strikes, with Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry saying the attack undermines Iran’s “sovereignty and security and constitute a clear violation of international laws and norms,” and China’s embassy in Iran calling the situation “severe and complex.”
Residents in Iran faced a long and terrifying night. “People reported the ground shaking, hearing explosions, and jets flying overhead,” Negar Mortazavi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, told CNN.
Azzam, a 35-year-old Iranian citizen who lives close to Saadat Abad in northern Tehran, an area targeted by Israel, told CNN: “I woke up with the whole house shaking. I was very scared, not knowing what had happened.”
Sam, 29, told CNN that he fears further attacks. “I am concerned about the escalation of this, and what this means for us in Tehran.” Like Azzam, he requested anonymity due to concerns for his safety.
Israel declared a state of special emergency, closing its airspace, shutting schools and banning social gatherings. “Tens of thousands” of Israeli soldiers were being called up in preparation for an Iranian retaliation, Israel’s military chief of staff said.
Fears of wider war
Analysts and experts have long warned that Israeli strikes on Iran’s nuclear capabilities could trigger a massive Iranian retaliation and threaten to tip the region into a full-scale war.
And if Israel and Iran become entangled in wider conflict, it could risk drawing the US into the fray. The US is Israel’s closest ally and biggest weapons supplier, and there are currently about 40,000 US troops across the Middle East, including nearly 4,000 in Iraq and Syria.
Indications of that risk emerged earlier this week as the US ordered the departure of non-essential personnel from locations around the Middle East as intelligence warnings increased that an Israeli strike on Iran was imminent.
Netanyahu has repeatedly pushed for a military option to stop Iran’s nuclear program, and recent US intelligence reports said that Israel was seeking to capitalize on the destruction inflicted after it bombed Iran’s missile production facilities and air defenses in October.
Experts say an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities would also likely spell the end of Iran’s nuclear negotiations with the US.
The facility at the heart of Iran’s nuclear ambitions was engulfed in flames on Friday, according to social media images geolocated by CNN and Iranian state television.
The nuclear complex in Natanz, a city about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Tehran, is considered Iran’s largest uranium enrichment facility. Analysts say the site is used to develop and assemble centrifuges for uranium enrichment, a key technology that turns uranium into nuclear fuel.
The Iranian atomic energy agency confirmed that the Natanz facility had been damaged. The complex has overground and underground facilities and it’s unclear what was impacted but no casualties were reported, the agency said.
The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said there were no elevated radiation levels at Natanz. Other nuclear facilities in Iran, Isfahan and Fordow “have not been impacted,” Grossi added.
‘Explosive drones’ activated
Israel’s Mossad spy agency smuggled weapons into Iran ahead of Friday’s strikes that were used to target its defenses from within, according to an Israeli security official.
The official said that “a base for launching explosive drones was established inside Iran and that the drones were activated during Friday’s attack to target missile launchers at a base near Tehran.”
Israel had also “smuggled precision weapons into central Iran and positioned them near surface-to-air missile systems,” the official said, adding that Israel had deployed strike systems on vehicles.
Iran oversees a so-called Axis of Resistance across the region that includes loyal proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, as well as various militia groups in Iraq and Syria. Since Israel’s war in Gaza began in 2023, attacks by those proxy groups have escalated in solidarity with the Palestinians.
Last year Israel and Iran’s years-long cold war erupted into the open with a series of missile strikes from both sides. At the time, the US warned Israel not to strike Iran’s energy or nuclear infrastructure.
Friday’s operation goes much further than previously seen. CNN’s security analyst Beth Sanner said that removing Salami is akin to taking out the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff: “You can imagine what Americans would do,” she said.
Iran is now “under existential threat” and as such, the Israelis will be expecting “a massive, much bigger retaliation than what they saw last time,” Sanner added.","['Helen Regan', 'Lauren Izso', 'Tamar Michaelis', 'Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Kara Fox']",en

Follow live updates here.
President Donald Trump told CNN in a brief phone call Friday morning that the United States “of course” supports Israel and called the country’s strikes on Iran overnight “a very successful attack,” while warning Iran to make a nuclear deal.
When asked about a statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday that sought to put distance between the US and the Israeli action, Trump told Dana Bash: “We of course support Israel, obviously, and supported it like nobody has ever supported it.”
The president went on to urge Iran to reach a deal.
“Iran should have listened to me when I said — you know, I gave them, I don’t know if you know but I gave them a 60-day warning and today is day 61,” he told CNN.
“They should now come to the table to make a deal before it’s too late. It will be too late for them. You know, the people I was dealing with are dead, the hardliners,” the president said. He would not specify which people he was referring to.
In contrast to Trump’s aggressive tone, Rubio clarified in a statement late Thursday that the US had no involvement in the strikes.
“Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said.
Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, a White House official said. He’d spoken to the prime minister several times on Thursday, including prior to Israel launching the strikes, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
The source would not divulge the substance of those earlier calls but reiterated that Trump believes the attack was a result of Iran failing to strike an agreement on a new nuclear deal before his 60-day deadline expired.
White House officials continue to argue that the president is committed to salvaging the nuclear talks. The source said special envoy Steve Witkoff is “ready” to meet Iranian officials when they are – whether it be in Oman on Sunday as previously scheduled or at some date thereafter.
The president had warned Iran earlier on Friday to agree to a nuclear deal “before there is nothing left,” suggesting in a social media post that subsequent Israeli attacks on the country will be “even more brutal.”
The post marked Trump’s first public comments since Israel launched strikes on Iran targeting its nuclear program and military leaders, with the US president saying he had tried to steer Iranian leaders toward diplomacy, but they failed to act at great cost.
“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,’ but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done,” Trump wrote.
Trump wrote that Iranian leaders “didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!”
“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end. Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left,” Trump added.
A sixth round of nuclear deal talks was still scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday as previously scheduled, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Special envoy Steve Witkoff was in touch with the Omanis overnight in an effort to keep the plans for this weekend on track, sources said. But those sources acknowledged that holding the talks this weekend is highly unlikely. Oman has facilitated the US-Iran talks to date.
Despite several rounds of talks between Iran and the US to thrash out a new nuclear deal, major sticking points remain, with Iran insisting on its right to nuclear enrichment. Trump said earlier this week that he’s grown less confident of being able to strike a deal, saying in an interview earlier this week that Tehran could be “delaying” an agreement.
Trump warned of possibility of ‘massive conflict’ in Middle East
Trump had warned earlier on Thursday of the possibility that “massive conflict” in the Middle East that could take place “soon.”
US officials were increasingly concerned that the risk of Israel striking Iran had risen after Tehran said on Thursday that it would ramp up its nuclear activities due to the International Atomic Energy Agency passing a resolution saying that the country was not in compliance with its non-proliferation commitments, senior US officials told CNN.
Questioned about a potential strike earlier on Thursday, Trump said it “could very well happen.”
“I don’t want to say imminent, but it’s something that could very well happen,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
US embassies in the Middle East carried out emergency action assessments this week, and that process is ongoing as the US monitors the threat environment in the region, the officials said.
Asked what the Israelis told him to prompt the departure of US personnel from the region, Trump replied: “They didn’t tell me anything, but I said look, there’s a chance of massive conflict.”
He described the deliberations that led him to the decision.
“We have a lot of American people in this area, and I said, look, we gotta tell them to get out cause something could happen – soon. And I don’t want to be the one that didn’t give any warning and missiles are flying into their buildings. It’s possible. So I had to do it. You know, I had the choice – do I do it or not? Doing it has its downside but it also has its upside, like you’re going to save a lot of lives if it should happen. Hopefully that doesn’t happen.”
Later Thursday, Trump in a Truth Social post underscored his preference for diplomacy in Iran, saying his administration remains “committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue!”
Trump also said he does not want Israel to target Iran as negotiations on a potential nuclear deal continue, with a sixth round of talks set for Sunday in Oman.
“I want to have an agreement with Iran. We’re fairly close to an agreement. … As long as I think there is an agreement, I don’t want them going in because that would blow it. Might help it, actually, but also could blow it,” he said when asked about a potential Israeli strike.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/middleeast/global-march-gaza-egypt-israel-blockade-intl,Thousands head to Egypt in bid to break Israel’s Gaza blockade,2025-06-12 11:36:59,"Thousands of activists from around the world are expected to descend on Egypt on Thursday for a “Global March to Gaza,” a movement aiming to break the Israeli blockade that has pushed the territory to the brink of famine.
Some 4,000 volunteers from over 80 countries will join the protest, according to organizers. They will land in Cairo, take buses to the city of Arish in northern Sinai, and then march around 30 miles through the desert peninsula to the Egyptian side of the Gaza border at Rafah. Organizers told CNN the activists will sleep in tents along the route and are expected to arrive at the border on Friday but do not plan to enter the war-ravaged enclave.
The march puts Egypt in an awkward position as it tries to balance its ties with Israel and the United States against its public condemnation of the war’s brutal toll on Gaza’s civilians. A key mediator with direct channels to both Hamas and Israel, Cairo has been wary of the conflict spilling over into its territory. It has kept its side of the Rafah crossing closed to Palestinians, even as anger at Israel’s actions continues to rise at home.
In a statement Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he expects the Egyptian government “to prevent the arrival of jihadist demonstrators to the border of Egypt-Israel and not to allow them to carry out provocations and to try to enter into Gaza.”
This will “endanger the security of IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers and we will not allow it,” Katz added.
The international activists will be joined by another convoy of 2,000 protesters arriving from Tunisia. That group arrived in Libya, which neighbors Egypt, on Wednesday, organizers said.
Among those joining the march are Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela, a former South African lawmaker and grandson of Nelson Mandela, and Hala Rharrit, a former US State Department diplomat who resigned from her US government position during the Biden administration over Washington’s handling of the Gaza war.
“This is just another tool, another way (for) the people to raise their voices, to let governments know that we are not happy,” Uzma Usmani, the sponsorship and logistics lead for the UK delegation of the march, told CNN. “We need to take things into our own hands, to raise awareness, to put pressure on all the different governments so that they start taking action,” she said.
As Israel’s war in Gaza enters its 21st month, high-profile international campaigners are becoming increasingly active in their attempt to break the siege.
On Monday, Israel intercepted a Gaza-bound aid ship, the “Madleen,” detaining its passengers and taking them to Israel.
Among the activists on board was Swedish climate and human rights activist Greta Thunberg and French member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan.
Israel imposed a full humanitarian blockade of Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians in the territory for 11 weeks.
Faced with growing international pressure, it began allowing a trickle of aid in late May. But humanitarian organizations say it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war.
Organizers of the Global March to Gaza have said that they have reached out to Egyptian authorities, informing them of their plans and asking for cooperation and protection but have received no response.
The Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement that activists must obtain permits ahead of their arrival in Cairo.
“Egypt stresses the importance of adhering to these established regulatory measures to ensure the safety of visiting delegations due to the sensitive security conditions in this border area since the onset of the crisis in Gaza,” the ministry said, adding that “that no requests or invitations will be considered or responded to if submitted outside the framework specified by the regulatory provisions.”
Organizers said they followed “all the required protocols detailed in this statement.”
They told CNN on Wednesday that some activists have experienced harassment and been detained upon arriving in the Egyptian capital, saying they fear deportation.
On Thursday, organizers said 170 people are currently facing delays and deportations at Cairo airport, but that thousands of participants are already in Egypt and are determined to continue their march.
CNN has reached out to the Egyptian foreign media press center and the foreign ministry for comment on those allegations.
In a video shared with CNN by the march’s Canadian delegation, a large number of Egyptian authorities are seen standing on the tarmac as the Canadian activists disembark a plane. One man can be seen holding a scarf with the Palestinian flag, and in another video, activists can be heard chanting “free Palestine.”
Rharrit, the former State Department official, told CNN: “Children are starving to death, and at this point, the only thing I feel I can do is action.”
“Now is no longer the time for talk only. We need action, and we saw that with the (“Madleen”) flotilla,” she told CNN’s Becky Anderson this week. “This is humanity saying no more, let the food in.”
Egyptian authorities “have no reason not to support this march,” Rharrit said, adding that delegations across the world had informed Egyptian embassies of their plan well ahead of time.
“There have been meetings with Egyptian ambassadors. Egyptian authorities have not said no,” she said, adding that the march is “in line with everything Egypt has been trying to do diplomatically.”","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Annoa Abekah-Mensah']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/middleeast/israel-gaza-ghf-attack-hnk-latam-intl,Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says Hamas attack has killed multiple aid workers,2025-06-12 00:40:46,"Multiple aid workers were killed after a bus was attacked in Gaza on Wednesday night, according to a US-backed humanitarian aid organization which accused Hamas of carrying out the assault.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a controversial US and Israeli-backed aid initiative, said on Wednesday night that a bus carrying more than two dozen of its team members was attacked by Hamas at around 10 p.m. local time, killing five and injuring others. GHF added on Thursday that three more team members had died.
CNN has reached out to the Hamas-controlled Government Media Office in Gaza for comment.
In reference to the same incident, Al-Khazindar Company, a Palestinian group working with GHF, said on Thursday that Hamas militants had targeted its workers, killing eight people.
“Hamas targeted them after several threats, and we never expected the situation to escalate to the point of assassinating these workers,” the company director Raafat Al-Khazindar told CNN, adding that other workers were beaten and shot.
The incident happened near the Quba Mosque in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, the director added.
On Sunday, Hamas media said its forces have “full authority and mandate to strike decisively against any entity or individual collaborating with the enemy’s plans or with any rogue, criminal, or traitorous elements that violate the law and the traditions of our people.”
“All agents, thieves, and armed criminal gangs are considered legitimate targets for the resistance and its security apparatus,” the militant group said.
More than 20 Palestinians killed
GHF was established amid Israeli accusations that Hamas is stealing aid in Gaza and profiting off its sale but the organization has been controversial from the get-go and criticized by multiple international aid agencies.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains desperate.
Multiple Palestinians have been killed by gunfire near aid distribution sites since GHF began operations.
More than 20 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near aid distribution sites in Gaza on Thursday, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
The ministry said 13 people were killed and more than 100 injured by Israeli fire near the aid distribution site in central Gaza along the Netzarim Corridor early Thursday morning.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they fired “warning shots” at people they say “posed a threat” to Israeli troops. The military also said that “the number of reported individuals injured does not align with the information held by the IDF.”
Another eight Palestinians were killed near distribution sites in southern Rafah early Thursday morning as they were seeking aid, according to the health ministry. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
GHF said that three distribution sites were open on Thursday, two in southern Gaza and one in central Gaza. The organization said they handed out approximately 45,000 boxes of pre-packaged food
Late Wednesday the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it “continues to receive reports from the Gaza Strip of people being killed and injured while trying to access food.” It did not specify any locations.
“OCHA reiterates in the strongest terms possible that no one should be forced to risk their lives to receive aid, as people across Gaza are at risk of famine,” it said.

A near-total communications blackout in parts of Gaza has now lasted over 24 hours, internet monitoring site Netblocks has said, warning the disruption would hamper search, rescue and aid efforts in the enclave that has been battered by Israeli military strikes.
The disruption in Gaza City and northern Gaza is the longest in recent months and continues to “severely limit visibility into events on the ground,” the site said in a post on Wednesday.
The blackout affects both physical and wireless data connections, as well as mobile phone usage.
CNN’s team in Jerusalem has been unable to contact anyone in Gaza since Wednesday.
“The collapse of telecommunications services, internet connectivity and emergency communication systems is again a real threat,” the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Wednesday.
“This would cripple life-saving coordination and prevent affected communities from receiving critical information.”
Reports of disruptions in central and southern Gaza began to emerge Thursday.
“Metrics show further disruptions to internet connectivity across the Gaza Strip; the telecoms disruptions are likely to impact search, rescue and aid efforts,” Netblocks said in an update.",['Lauren Iszo'],en

The two leaders spoke on the phone on Monday. Trump later said the call went “very well, very smooth.”
The call for Israel to change course comes as Washington pushes for a nuclear deal with Iran and engages in indirect talks with Hamas over a ceasefire in Gaza.
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
Netanyahu convened his top ministers Tuesday night after there was “some progress” in negotiations toward a ceasefire deal, according to his office. The purpose of the meeting was to give updates on the negotiations and discuss next steps.
Earlier in the day, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said there had been recent progress in ceasefire talks that also aim to bring back hostages held in Gaza.
“Israel is serious in its will to secure a hostage deal. There has recently been certain progress,” Sa’ar told a news conference in Jerusalem, adding that “in light of past experience, I don’t want to overstate it at this point.”
On Thursday, Hamas said it remains open to the ceasefire deal proposed by US envoy Steve Witkoff, but said it requires stronger guarantees against Israeli attacks.
In a televised speech on Thursday, Khalil Al-Hayya, a high-ranking official in the militant group, said Hamas has not rejected Witkoff’s proposal but has submitted amendments with stronger security guarantees.
Hamas wants any deal to include a permanent end to the war in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli forces.
Growing rift
Trump and Netanyahu appear increasingly at odds over the war in Gaza as the conflict passes the 20-month mark. Netanyahu has made clear that his war goals include the complete disarmament and removal of Hamas, while Trump has pushed for an end to the war.
It’s one of several major issues in the region where a growing rift is emerging between the US and Israel. In recent weeks, the Trump administration bypassed Israel on a trip to the Middle East, reached a ceasefire deal with the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen that failed to halt their ballistic missile attacks at Israel, and lifted sanctions on Syria – even as Israel warns against legitimizing a regime run by former jihadists.
Meanwhile, Trump said his administration is “trying to make a deal so that there’s no destruction and death” in Iran. The sixth round of talks between the US and Iran is slated to start in the coming days.
During their call, Trump asked Netanyahu to stop talking about an attack on Iran, the source familiar with the conversation said, and halt the leaks and reports about plans and preparations for an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Netanyahu has repeatedly pushed for a military option to stop Iran’s nuclear program. In the conversation with Trump, Netanyahu told Trump that Iran is just trying to buy time and isn’t serious about negotiations, the source said. CNN reported last month that Israel was preparing for a possible strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
The Trump administration has also been trying to expand the Abraham Accords, the landmark series of agreements from Trump’s first term that saw Israel normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.
But Saudi Arabia – whose agreement to such a deal would be the ultimate prize – has repeatedly made clear that it will not normalize relations with Israel without concrete steps towards recognition of a Palestinian state and a plan to implement the two-state solution.
US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said this week that a two-state solution is no longer a goal of US policy, as it had been for decades of both Republican and Democrat administrations.
“Unless there are some significant things that happen that change the culture, there’s no room for it,” Huckabee told Bloomberg News in an interview in Jerusalem. He said it won’t happen “in our lifetime.” Huckabee has previously advocated for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and once said that “there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.”
Earlier in the war, Trump laid out vague plans for a “Gaza Riviera” that envisioned US control of the coastal enclave and the displacement of large parts of the Palestinian population living there.","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/10/europe/france-palestinian-authority-reform-commitments-intl,France says Palestinian Authority makes ‘unprecedented commitments’ to reform ahead of conference on statehood,2025-06-10 16:14:06,"France said it has received a letter from the Palestinian Authority that contains “concrete and unprecedented commitments” to reform as Paris prepares to co-chair a conference on Palestinian statehood in New York.
The letter, which France said was signed by Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas, includes condemnation of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, a call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages, and pledges to hold elections and reform the authority, according to excerpts shared with CNN.
“Hamas will no longer rule Gaza and must hand over its weapons and military capabilities to the Palestinian Security Forces, which will oversee their removal outside the occupied Palestinian territory, with Arab and international support,” the Élysée Palace cited Abbas as writing.
The letter France says it received comes as anticipation builds around whether President Emmanuel Macron might recognize the State of Palestine at a summit next week aimed at building support for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. France is co-chairing the summit with Saudi Arabia.
Hussein Al-Sheikh, vice president of the PA, confirmed to CNN that the Palestinian presidency sent the letter to France.
France said Abbas pledged to organize presidential and general elections within a year in order to “rejuvenate the Palestinian governance.”
Abbas, 89, is deeply unpopular among Palestinians. He has led the PA since the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 2004 and has clung to power despite being seen by critics as lacking democratic legitimacy. Proposals put forth by Arab states for a post-war Gaza have excluded Hamas from governance and called for the reformation of the PA.
The Guardian reported on Saturday that France may be retreating from its plan. The conference “has weakened its ambition and will instead hope to agree on steps towards recognition,” The Guardian said, citing diplomats, adding that “French officials briefing their Israeli counterparts this week reassured them the conference will not be the moment for recognition.”
However, an Élysée source told CNN that the French presidency refutes such reports, and that Paris is moving in the direction of recognizing a Palestinian state.
“We can clearly see that some have an interest in suggesting that we are not moving in the direction of recognition. That is false,” the source said Tuesday, adding that “we are determined to recognize a Palestinian state in order to create the conditions for the state’s existence.”
The source highlighted the importance of the upcoming conference at the UN.
“Recognizing Palestinian statehood is consistent with France’s position in support of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,” the source said. “As part of the June 18 conference, it must contribute meaningfully to the momentum behind implementing the two-state solution, based on the principles reaffirmed by the President of the Republic.”
France would be the most prominent Western country to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last year, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized the State of Palestine in a move that provoked backlash from Israel.","['Saskya Vandoorne', 'Joseph Ataman', 'Nadeen Ebrahim']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/10/uk/uk-sanctions-israel-ministers-smotrich-ben-gvir-intl,"UK, Canada and Western allies sanction two far-right Israeli government ministers",2025-06-10 00:00:00,"The United Kingdom, Canada and other allies announced sanctions Tuesday on two hardline Israeli government ministers for repeatedly “inciting violence against Palestinians,” in a stark joint move that comes amid growing Western condemnation of Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich will face a travel ban and an asset freeze, the UK government said.
Ben Gvir and Smotrich both lead far-right political parties that help keep Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fragile governing coalition afloat. Both men have faced criticism for their inflammatory comments about the occupied West Bank as well as their positions on the war in Gaza.
The sanctions are being jointly implemented by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and the UK, according to a joint statement by the five countries’ foreign ministers.
“We are steadfastly committed to the two-state solution which is the only way to guarantee security and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians and ensure long term stability in the region, but it is imperilled by extremist settler violence and settlement expansion,” the joint statement said.
“Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous,” the statement added. “We have engaged the Israeli Government on this issue extensively, yet violent perpetrators continue to act with encouragement and impunity.”
The sanctions imposed by the five Western nations represent a break in policy with the United States. While European and Commonwealth allies have increasingly put pressure on Netanyahu’s government, the Trump administration has repeatedly reaffirmed the US-Israel alliance. Washington has also called for the conflict in Gaza to end, but last week, the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution demanding a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the sanctions, saying the actions “do not advance US-led efforts to achieve a ceasefire, bring all hostages home, and end the war.”
He said that the US rejected “any notion of equivalence” between the Israeli government and Hamas and “we remind our partners not to forget who the real enemy is.” Rubio added, “The United States urges the reversal of the sanctions and stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel.”
While the sanctions are in relation to the West Bank, the Western allies’ joint statement added that “of course this cannot be seen in isolation from the catastrophe in Gaza. We continue to be appalled by the immense suffering of civilians, including the denial of essential aid.”
Smotrich and Ben Gvir both live in settlements in the West Bank, which Palestinians and the vast majority of the international community hold as part of a future Palestinian state.
Both ministers responded defiantly to the travel bans and financial sanctions on Tuesday afternoon, vowing to continue their agenda and accusing Britain of echoing its colonial-era restrictions on Jewish migration to British-mandate Palestine.
Ben Gvir, the leader of the Jewish Power party, said that “the sanctions do not scare me,” adding, “I will continue to act for our country, for our people, I will continue to act and make sure that they do not let humanitarian aid into Hamas.”
Smotrich, speaking during the inauguration of the new Jewish settlement of Mitzpe Ziv in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, said that he “heard that Britain has decided to impose sanctions on me because I’m thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state. There couldn’t be better timing than this.”
“Britain already tried once to prevent us from settling the cradle of our homeland, and we will not let it happen again. With God’s help, we are determined to continue building,” said Smotrich, who leads the National Religious Party–Religious Zionism.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the government will hold a “special meeting” early next week “to decide on our response to this unacceptable decision.”
“It is outrageous that elected representatives and members of the government are subjected to this kind of measure,” Saar said.
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway said in their statement: “The measures announced today do not deviate from our unwavering support for Israel’s security and we continue to condemn the horrific terror attacks of 7 October by Hamas. Today’s measures are targeted towards individuals who in our view undermine Israel’s own security and its standing in the world.”
Ben Gvir quit Netanyahu’s government in January to protest the ceasefire in Gaza, only rejoining the government after Israel returned to war in March. He has repeatedly called for Palestinians to be driven out of Gaza and previously said Israel should “encourage voluntary migration of Gazans to countries around the world.”
Smotrich, who as finance minister has a seat on the Israeli security cabinet and holds significant sway over Netanyahu, has previously called for the formal annexation of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In May, he said his idea of victory in Gaza would be that the territory is “destroyed” and civilians are moved to a “humanitarian zone” in the south of the strip or leave for third countries.
Last month, UK Foreign Minister David Lammy slammed Smotrich’s comments on the possible destruction and cleansing of Gaza, telling British lawmakers: “It is extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous, and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.”
At the time, the UK paused trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers, but stopped short of sanctioning the far-right Israeli minister.

“Greta Thunberg just departed Israel on a flight to Sweden (via France),” Israel’s foreign ministry wrote in a post on X alongside two photos of the young activist aboard a plane.
Thunberg, 22, is a well-known climate activist who has long eschewed air travel, famously sailing to a climate conference in New York in 2019.
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), which organized the aid ship, the Madleen, said that four of the 12 activists who had been on board left Israel on Tuesday: Thunberg, two French citizens and a Spanish citizen. Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, remains in detention, along with seven other activists from Turkey, the Netherlands, France, Brazil and Germany, it said.
“Over the last days and hours, the President of the European Parliament has been in constant contact with the Israeli authorities…to ensure the safety and security of the Member of the European Parliament, Rima Hassan, who was one of the people aboard the boat Madleen and all those accompanying her,” Delphine Colard, a spokesperson for the European Parliament, said on Monday.
Adalah, an Israel-based non-governmental legal organization that is representing some of the activists, said that those who remain are being held in Givon Prison in Ramleh, central Israel.
France’s foreign minister said that crew members who refused to agree to depart voluntarily would be deported.
“Last night our consul was able to see the six French nationals who were arrested by the Israeli authorities. Their families have been contacted. One of them agreed to a voluntary departure and is expected to return today. The other five will be deported,” Jean-Noël Barrot wrote in a post on X.
Israel’s foreign ministry had said earlier that anyone who refused to sign deportation documents and leave Israel would be brought before judicial authorities to authorize their deportation.
The detained crew of the Gaza-bound aid ship that was intercepted by Israel on Monday morning docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod Monday evening, according to Israel’s foreign ministry.
The Madleen is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel’s blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat.
The FFC said the Israeli military had “attacked” and “unlawfully boarded” the Madleen which was attempting to deliver aid to Gaza – where more than 600 days of war, and an 11-week Israeli blockade of all aid, has pushed the enclave’s 2.1 million people deeper into a hunger crisis.
Amnesty International also condemned the detention of the activists.
“The operation of intercepting and blocking the Madleen in the middle of the night and in international waters violates international law and put the safety of those on the boat at risk,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said in a statement.
In a statement to CNN, Israel said that it “is preventing the entry of all vessels into the Gaza Strip, in accordance with international law.”
Israel had repeatedly vowed to stop the aid boat from reaching Gaza and described the ship as a “selfie yacht” carrying “celebrities.”
Israel imposed a full humanitarian blockade of Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory for 11 weeks.
Faced with growing international pressure, Israel began allowing a trickle of aid in late May. But humanitarian organizations say it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, and have warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine. A UN-backed report warned in late April that one in five people were facing starvation.
Dozens of Palestinians have been killed over the past week while on their way to try and obtain aid from a new US-backed group commissioned to deliver aid to Gaza, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The group is intended to replace the UN-led system of distributing aid in Gaza. The United Nations has warned that the new distribution mechanism has become a “death trap” for desperate people seeking food in the strip.",['Lucas Lilieholm'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/08/middleeast/freedom-flotilla-gaza-aid-ship-thunberg-intl-hnk,Seized Gaza aid ship docks in Israel with Greta Thunberg aboard,2025-06-09 00:52:11,"The detained crew of the Gaza-bound aid ship that was intercepted by Israel on Monday morning docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod Monday evening, according to Israel’s foreign ministry.
Those on board the Madleen aid ship, including Sweden’s Greta Thunberg and other prominent activists, underwent medical examinations on Monday evening, the foreign ministry said.
On arrival to Ashdod, the activists were taken to a room to be shown a screening of the “horror film documenting the October 7 massacre” carried out by Hamas, according to Israeli defense minister Israel Katz.
“When they saw what it was about, they refused to continue watching,” Katz claimed.
Katz accused Greta and the rest of the ship’s crew of ignoring Hamas atrocities by “closing their eyes to the truth.”
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) said the Israeli military had “attacked” and “unlawfully boarded” the Madleen, which was attempting to deliver aid to Gaza – where more than 600 days of war, and an 11-week Israeli blockade of all aid, has pushed the enclave’s 2.1 million people deeper into a hunger crisis.
Earlier on Monday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel planned to bring the detained activists to Ashdod port and then through a “quick deportation process” via Ben-Gurion Airport.
The ministry also previously posted a video showing members of the Madleen crew sitting side by side wearing orange life jackets while a solider offered them bottled water and plastic-wrapped sandwiches. Thunberg can be seen sitting near the front of the group.
The FFC had earlier said the ship had come “under assault in international waters” in a Telegram post.
“Quadcopters are surrounding the ship, spraying it with a white paint-like substance. Communications are jammed, and disturbing sounds are being played over the radio,” the FFC said. A video posted by Israel’s foreign ministry appeared to show a Navy staffer sending a radio message to the vessel saying the “maritime zone off the coast of Gaza was closed.”
In a video livestreamed from the boat, activist Yasemin Acar showed a white substance on the deck, saying it had been dropped on the vessel. Acar was later heard saying it was affecting her eyes.
The FFC group also posted a video on Telegram, showing members of the crew sitting inside the boat with their hands in the air.
After losing communication with the vessel, the FFC began posting pre-recorded video messages from Thunberg and others onboard. “If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the Israeli occupational forces, or forces that support Israel,” Thunberg said in her video.
Later Monday, US President Donald Trump called Thunberg a “strange” and “young, angry person,” telling a roundtable event at the White House that he thinks she “has to go to an anger management class.”
“That’s my primary recommendation for her,” Trump said. “Israel has enough problems without kidnapping Greta Thunberg.”
In a statement, the FFC said Israel had acted with “total impunity” and that the vessel’s cargo, which included baby formula, food and medical supplies was “confiscated.” Israel said it would transfer the goods to Gaza through humanitarian channels.
“Israel has no legal authority to detain international volunteers aboard the Madleen,” said Huwaida Arraf, human rights attorney and Freedom Flotilla organizer. “This seizure blatantly violates international law and defies the (International Court of Justice’s) binding orders requiring unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza.”
Amnesty International also condemned the detention of the activists.
“The operation of intercepting and blocking the Madleen in the middle of the night and in international waters violates international law and put the safety of those on the boat at risk,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said in a statement.
In a statement to CNN, Israel said that it “is preventing the entry of all vessels into the Gaza Strip, in accordance with international law.”
Israel had repeatedly vowed to stop the aid boat from reaching Gaza, and described the ship as a “selfie yacht” carrying “celebrities.”
“I have instructed the IDF to ensure that the Madleen flotilla does not reach Gaza,” Katz said on Sunday.
Israel’s foreign ministry said the group “attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity.”
“There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip – they do not involve Instagram selfies,” it added.
In an earlier statement on Monday, the ministry said “unauthorized attempts to breach the blockade are dangerous, unlawful, and undermine ongoing humanitarian efforts.”
The French foreign ministry said on Monday that there were six French nationals on board the Madleen, and that it is in contact with Israeli authorities to bring them back. The French government had previously warned the activists against their plan “due to the risks involved,” a statement from the ministry added.
An Élysée source told CNN that France’s President Emmanuel Macron “has requested that arrangements be made, as quickly as possible, for the return” of its nationals.
The foreign ministry statement also called on the Israeli government to allow “immediate, large-scale, and unhindered access for humanitarian aid to Gaza.”
Hamas demanded the immediate release of the activists and condemned their detention in a statement, calling the interception “a flagrant violation of international law, and an attack on civilian volunteers acting out of humanitarian motives.”
As the Madleen was taken to Ashdod, some 15 activists protested the ship’s seizure in the city. The demonstrators carried signs reading, “resist genocide,” “release the Madleen activists now” and “stop state terror.”
“We… have come to express our support and solidarity with the Madleen as part of the Freedom Flotilla, whose activists were abducted by Israel,” one activist said in English. The demonstrators were interrupted by a passerby who shouted in Hebrew, “You’re living in Israel,” calling the protesters “bullies” and “hooligans.”
The Madleen is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel’s blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat.
The crew, which had publicized the location of the ship with an online tracker, began preparing for the possibility of interception by the Israeli military. On Monday morning, the UK-flagged civilian vessel was north of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea, slowly approaching the coast of Gaza, but the tracker has since appeared to have stopped.
“We know that it’s a very risky mission and we know that previous experiences with flotillas like this have resulted in attacks, violence and even cases of death,” Thunberg told CNN on Saturday.
Israel imposed a full humanitarian blockade of Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory for 11 weeks.

The United Nations has warned that the new distribution mechanism has become a “death trap” for desperate people seeking food in the strip.
Last month, another vessel from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition came under what its organizers claimed was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters. The group did not provide evidence that the drone was Israeli, while the Israeli military has declined to comment on the alleged attack.
The ship, the Conscience, was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists, including Thunberg, were due to board before it departed for Gaza.
The later voyage on the Madleen, which was intercepted by Israel, departed from Sicily last Friday.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/middleeast/us-israel-aid-gaza-looting-intl,Aid to Gaza hangs by a thread amid looting and starvation,2025-06-09 04:00:03,"Israel’s blockade of Gaza may have been partially lifted – and a new US-backed plan to deliver aid has begun. But there are multiple indications that the plight of Gazans is rapidly worsening.
Restrictions imposed by the Israeli military on aid routes, ongoing airstrikes, a lack of security and the continuous displacement of tens of thousands of people are aggravating an already alarming situation, according to the UN and other aid agencies. The supplies that do get in risk getting looted.
“People in Gaza are starving. This demands the urgent opening of all crossings and allowing unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations to deliver aid at scale, through multiple routes,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest assessment.
One woman, Umm Zuhair, who was trying to get food for her family on Sunday at one of newly established aid distribution sites, told CNN: “We’re so hungry that we’re willing to risk getting shot just for a kilo of flour.”
The number of children in Gaza with acute malnutrition is rising, the UN reported Saturday, while a lack of fuel threatens to close hospitals that are still operating.
The Israeli agency handling the inspection of aid going into Gaza, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), said Saturday that 350 trucks containing humanitarian aid had entered the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom crossing in the last week – less than 20 per cent of the volume of goods getting into Gaza before the conflict.
And even the aid that gets in frequently does not make it to the most desperate. UN agencies report continuing difficulties with getting distribution routes within Gaza agreed with the Israeli military. OCHA said that out of 16 truckloads ready for distribution last Thursday, five were rejected, including fuel and water, and six failed to reach their destination.
Additionally, the looting of aid convoys in Gaza has risen sharply in recent weeks.
“Operations have faced unprecedented levels of insecurity and a very high risk of looting, with partners reporting that most looting incidents are conducted by desperate civilians,” according to OCHA.
Nahed Shehaibar, head of the Private Transport Association in Gaza, said on Saturday that transport of aid had been suspended “for the third consecutive day due to repeated attacks on trucks, including gunfire that has damaged and put several trucks out of service.”
Last week the association reported that one driver was killed and another injured while trying to deliver aid, but Shehaibar said on Sunday that 11 trucks of commercial goods had reached merchants in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza successfully.
The distribution of aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the US and Israeli-backed aid initiative that started operating late last month, has been dogged by security issues.
A CNN investigation last week pointed to the Israeli military opening fire on crowds of Palestinians as they tried to make their way towards one of GHF’s hubs on Sunday June 1, killing at least 31, according to the Palestinian ministry of health The IDF disputed the accounts of the incident. There were similar deadly incidents last Monday and Tuesday; the IDF said in those instances that it had fired warning shots at “suspects” who had approached its positions, but challenged the casualty figures.
On Sunday, GHF said it operated three distribution sites - two in southern Gaza and one in central Gaza - to hand out more than 17,000 boxes of food. In addition, GHF said in its daily update that it gave more than 10,000 meals to community leaders north of Rafah in what the organization called a pilot test of “direct-to-community distribution.”
But many people who went to the Netzarim site in central Gaza left empty-handed.
Mohammad Salim told CNN: “I went at 6 a.m. and found nothing. What’s happening is shameful. I’m holding an empty cardboard box – there’s nothing inside, not even lentils.”
He said some people took more than they needed and complained there was no ID-based distribution system, as operated by the UN. CNN has previously reported that GHF has no system in place to screen aid recipients.
Nader Musleh, who had walked from Al-Mawasi several kilometers away, agreed.
“Some people took five or 10 boxes, and there’s no organization at all,” he said.
Mohammad Abu Akouz was one of several civilians who alleged that some people were injured after coming under Israeli tank fire as they made their way to the site.
An Israeli military official told CNN that Israeli forces fired what they called “warning shots” from an armored vehicle approximately a kilometer from the distribution site. The official said the area is an active war zone.
GHF said it had been unable to open its sites on Saturday, accusing Hamas of making threats against its operations, including against drivers and Palestinian workers. It said the threats had made it impossible to proceed without putting innocent lives at risk.
A driver familiar with the operation, who asked not to be named for security reasons, told CNN on Sunday that Hamas had “threatened the bus drivers responsible for transporting workers to the three American aid distribution points, warning them not to continue the transfers.”
The drivers had been scheduled to move 180 employees to the three distribution sites, he added.
GHF said on Friday that it had distributed more than 140,000 boxes of food, with each box intended to feed a family for half a week. The boxes contain pasta, lentils and cooking oil, among other products. GHF says its goal is to distribute boxes containing enough food for 4.5 million meals each day.
After last week’s shootings, GHF appealed to people not to arrive at distribution points “before the official opening time or gather near the gates ahead of schedule. This is for your safety and the safety of others.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday in a post on X that gathering outside distribution centers outside of announced hours was “strictly prohibited,” and warned that the areas around the aid hubs were closed military zones between 6 p.m. (11 a.m. ET) and 6 a.m. (11 p.m. ET).
But even the opening of different distribution sites has been sporadic and poorly communicated. On Sunday night, GHF said on its public Facebook page that it would open three sites for distribution on Monday. Yet the daily summary on Monday evening said only two sites were open. Asked about the discrepancy, a GHF spokesman said he “couldn’t remember” whether the organization announced that more sites would be open.
The UN says that the use of the Israeli and American-backed GHF has militarized aid distribution and is inadequate for the huge task of feeding families in Gaza. GHF has no presence in northern Gaza.
In its latest assessment, OCHA said that 90 per cent of families in Gaza lack the cash needed to buy what little food remains available in markets. “Meat, dairy, vegetables and fruit are nearly absent from people’s diets,” it said.
Half of the community kitchens in Gaza have been forced to stop cooking due to lack of supplies or displacement orders, according to OCHA.
The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) – the main agency for supplying aid in Gaza – said Saturday that a nutrition study had found that the percentage of children under 5 suffering from acute malnutrition had risen from 4.7% in the first half of May to 5.8% in the second half of the month.
UNRWA said the number of children forced to fend for themselves had pushed an increasing number into “dangerous survival strategies. Children are reported working on the streets, participating in looting or gathering within large crowds in search of food supplies at insecure distribution points.”
It’s not just food that is running chronically short.
Dr. Mohamed Abu Salmiya, director of Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told CNN on Sunday that the few hospitals in Gaza still operating “will completely shut down within two days if fuel does not enter.”
He added that “a large number of the wounded cannot be treated due to the lack of blood supplies and medical equipment,” and medical staff faced difficult choices about which patients to save.
The Palestinian health ministry said Sunday that Al-Shifa Hospital and the Baptist Ahli Hospital, both in northern Gaza, were at risk of shutting down service within 24 hours. It said that would mean the collapse of what remains of the healthcare system in Gaza City.
In the south, the ministry said the Nasser Medical Complex was operating on a limited fuel supply that will last no more than two days.","['Tim Lister', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Eyad Kourdi', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) made the announcement on Sunday after the body went through an identification process.
Sinwar is the younger brother of former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by the Israeli military in southern Gaza in October.
His death marks the latest in a string of assassinations that have dealt a serious blow to the group’s top brass but are yet to break its grip on power in the besieged enclave.
The elusive Sinwar was targeted in a massive airstrike on the hospital in Khan Younis on May 13, a day after Hamas released Israeli-American soldier Edan Alexander.
At the time, the IDF claimed it had struck “Hamas terrorists in a command-and-control center” in underground infrastructure at the hospital.
But it took more than two weeks for Israel to say that it had definitively killed Sinwar in the strike.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the announcement on the 600th day of the war two weeks ago.
“We changed the face of the Middle East, we pushed the terrorists from our territories, we entered the Gaza Strip with force, we eliminated tens of thousands of terrorists, we eliminated (Mohammad) Deif, (Ismail) Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Sinwar,” Netanyahu said in a speech at the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/08/middleeast/israel-vows-stop-thunberg-freedom-flotilla-latam-intl,Israel vows to stop aid boat with Greta Thunberg and other activists on board from reaching Gaza,2025-06-08 18:11:13,"Israel vowed on Sunday to stop an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists on board from reaching Gaza.
As of Sunday evening, the UK-flagged civilian vessel was north of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea, slowly approaching the coast of Gaza. The “Madleen” is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel’s blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat.
“We know that it’s a very risky mission and we know that previous experiences with flotillas like this have resulted in attacks, violence and even cases of death,” Thunberg told CNN on Saturday.
“But of course none of those risks are even remotely as high as the risk that Palestinians are facing everyday just by trying to survive.”
Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated that the Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, would not make it to the besieged enclave.
“I have instructed the IDF to ensure that the ‘Madleen’ flotilla does not reach Gaza,” said Katz in a statement, referring to the name of the ship.
Katz warned the ship that “you’d better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza.”
Thunberg and the Madleen expect to reach Gaza within the next day, organizer Yasemin Acar told CNN on Saturday.
“We are still on our way to Gaza. There’s no turning back, and we’re hoping to make it into Gaza within two days,” Acar said.
The coalition campaigns to end Israel’s blockade of Gaza and has tried to reach the enclave several times in the past
After an 11-week blockade that prevented any humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, Israel has begun allowing a trickle of aid in once again.
But it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, with humanitarian organizations warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine.
Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, said on social media that the flotilla carries more than food.
“It is not only the aid, it is the HUMANITY THEY CARRY. For all of us,” she said.
The crew, which has publicized the location of the ship with an online tracker, began preparing for the possibility of interception by the Israeli military.
Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, is also onboard the Madleen.
“From both a legal and moral standpoint, Israel has no right to intercept this vessel,” the group said in a statement.
“The people of Gaza, under siege, starving, and facing the threat of annihilation, have the legal right to decide who enters their territories.”
Last month, another vessel from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition came under what its organizers said was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters. The group did not provide evidence that the drone was Israeli, while the Israeli military has declined to comment on the alleged attack.
The ship, the “Conscience,” was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists were due to board before it departed for Gaza, more than 1,000 miles away, but had not made it into port, the group said.
The coalition told CNN that Thunberg was among those who were expected to board the vessel in Malta.","['Abeer Salman', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/08/middleeast/gaza-yasser-abu-shabab-israel-aid-intl,Who is Abu Shabab? The Gaza militia leader Israel says it is arming - and Hamas wants to kill,2025-06-08 16:00:13,"The photo shows a lean, tanned man in a dark helmet. He’s grasping a rifle and UN vehicles move behind him as he waves through traffic.
The man is Yasser Abu Shabab, who says he commands hundreds of armed men known as the Popular Forces to offer protection to international organizations working in southern Gaza.
In his early thirties, Abu Shabab is from a prominent Bedouin family in southern Gaza. On October 7, 2023, he was languishing in a Hamas-run jail in Gaza, accused of drug trafficking, before being released after the conflict started.
Now he is an emerging presence in southern Gaza, controlling aid routes near the crucial Kerem Shalom crossing and providing men to guard convoys against looting, which has only worsened since limited aid started entering Gaza in mid-May following an Israeli blockade.
As Hamas’ grip on Gaza has weakened and the territory’s police force has been hollowed out, gangs have emerged to steal humanitarian aid from convoys and re-sell it. But many convoys are also stopped and ransacked by desperate civilians.
Abu Shabab told CNN that he leads “a group of citizens from this community who have volunteered to protect humanitarian aid from looting and corruption.”
The reality is more complicated.
Israeli officials have acknowledged providing weapons to Abu Shabab’s militia, as part of an operation to arm local groups to counter Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the covert enterprise earlier this week, saying the security forces had “activated clans in Gaza which oppose Hamas.” He did not name Abu Shabab, but Israeli officials told CNN that Abu Shabab is part of the program.
Abu Shabab insisted to CNN that his men had not received weapons from the Israelis. “Our equipment is extremely basic, passed down by volunteers from their forefathers or assembled from limited local resources.”
For its part, Hamas says Abu Shabab is a traitor and a gangster. Last week, the group said: “We pledge before God to continue confronting the dens of that criminal and his gang, no matter the cost of the sacrifices we make.”
Hamas killed his brother last year and has tried to kill Abu Shabab at least twice, according to Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
In response to written questions from CNN, Abu Shabab repeatedly denied any connection with the Israeli military, saying: “Our forces do not engage in any form of communication with the Israeli army, neither directly nor indirectly.”
Analysts find that difficult to believe, based on evidence of his movements in Israeli-controlled areas of Gaza. One video from late May shows Abu Shabab stopping a Red Cross vehicle and talking with an official. CNN geolocated the encounter to an Israeli-controlled buffer zone close to the crossing point at Kerem Shalom. Other videos show encounters with United Nations’ convoys in the same area.
Israel – and in particular Netanyahu – has never laid out clear plans for what governance and security in Gaza might look like if or when Hamas is defeated. Israel has been trying to find groups or clans opposed to Hamas who might play a role, but more recently Netanyahu and other ministers endorsed a plan put forward by US President Donald Trump for relocating Gaza’s residents and redeveloping the territory.
A growing role
Abu Shabab has had a presence near the ruins of Gaza’s long defunct airport in Rafah since late last year. Shehada at the ECFR said that while the ceasefire held earlier this year, his group appeared to vanish.
But his significance has grown in recent weeks, since Israeli authorities began to allow a trickle of aid to reach Gaza through Kerem Shalom in mid-May. Abu Shabab’s social media presence, along with slick videos and fluent English commentary, has expanded.
“It’s nearly impossible this is being done inside Gaza,” Shehada said. “It’s probably someone outside that is running this entire psy-op.”
A diplomatic official told CNN that the UN had to deal with local elements as it tried to distribute aid, whether they are backed by Hamas or not.
Abu Shabab “has a few square kilometers of an area under his control, and then it’s on to the next guy,” the official said. “The fact that he is not targeted by the Israelis is a clear indication of how they see him.”
The official also asserted that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – the controversial new US-backed organization tasked with distributing aid in Gaza – had contact with Abu Shabab, whether directly or indirectly.
Abu Shabab responded to CNN that “with regard to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, we stress the need for its work to operate within a unified national framework and to maintain continuous coordination with all legitimate parties.”
GHF told CNN on Sunday that it had no collaboration at all with Abu Shabab’s group. “We do have local Palestinian workers we are very proud of but none is armed and they do not belong to Abu Shabab’s organization,” GHF said.
Convoys and more
Last month, soon after limited aid began entering Gaza, Abu Shabab posted that his group had secured 101 trucks of aid, mostly flour, brought in by the World Food Programme, and praised “my loyal brothers who sacrificed their lives, and everyone who volunteered their primitive weapons or a drop of sweat to feed the bereaved and displaced.”
Truck drivers told CNN that Shabab had provided 200 armed men to protect the convoys.
“Our forces regularly accompany aid convoys, and protecting vulnerable civilians is one of our top priorities,” Abu Shabab told CNN.
His group’s role has expanded beyond protecting convoys.
On May 17, the day before the Kerem Shalom crossing reopened, work started on a tent encampment in eastern Rafah, according to satellite imagery reviewed by CNN. That work appears to have concluded on May 30.
The camp is less than 500 meters from where Abu Shabab runs checkpoints.
Four days later the so-called Popular Forces issued a statement saying that Abu Shabab “invites the residents of these areas to return, where food, drink, shelter, security and safety have been provided, shelter camps have been set up, and humanitarian relief routes have been opened.”
The encampment is in an area known as the Morag Corridor, to which the Israeli military wants Gazans to move as it orders evacuation orders for much of the strip.
Early in May, the far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the population of Gaza, would be “concentrated” in a narrow strip of land between the Egyptian border and the corridor.
A senior Israeli security official said at the same time that the goal was to separate humanitarian aid from Hamas “by involving civilian companies and creating a secured zone patrolled by the IDF.”
This would include a “sterile area in the Rafah region beyond the Morag route, where IDF will screen all entrants to prevent Hamas infiltrators.”
Palestinian branding
Abu Shabab’s force uses Palestinian insignia and flags prominently on its uniforms, but he told CNN that his “grassroots forces are not an official authority, nor are we operating under a direct mandate from the Palestinian Authority.”
The office of the spokesperson for the Palestinian Security Forces, Major General Anwar Rajab, told CNN there was no connection between the Palestinian security apparatus and Abu Shabab’s group.
Nor does his family want anything to do with him.
“Leaders and elders of the Abu Shabab family” said in a statement that they had confronted him about videos showing “Yasser’s groups involved in dangerous security engagements, even working within undercover units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces that brutally kill our people.”
The family declared its “complete disassociation from Yasser Abu Shabab” and urged anyone who had joined his security groups to do the same.
“We have no objection to those around him eliminating him immediately; we state clearly that his blood is wasted,” the family statement said.
Abu Shabab told CNN that the statement was “fabricated and false” and accompanied by “a media campaign targeting me and my colleagues.”
He said his group had endured “false accusations and systematic smear campaigns, and we have paid a heavy price,” also alleging that Hamas had killed several of the group’s volunteers “and members of my own family while we were guarding aid convoys for international organizations.”
Muhammad Shehada at ECFR said there is evidence that Abu Shabab’s presence is expanding with Israeli support into Khan Younis, to the north of his stronghold.
Even so, his reach is still limited. The Popular Forces speaks of “hundreds of daily requests we receive on our Facebook page from individuals seeking to join us,” but analysts believe Abu Shabab probably has only about 300 men under his command.
Most people in Gaza would never think of joining him for fear of being branded collaborators, said Shehada.
Even so, he added, Abu Shabab’s militia now serve multiple functions for the Israelis, helping control where aid goes, or does not go; trying to entice desperate and hungry people to the so-called ‘safe zone’ in eastern Rafah; and carrying out high-risk missions to detect the presence of Hamas fighters.","['Tim Lister', 'Oren Liebermann', 'Eyad Kourdi']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/middleeast/israel-killed-leader-palestinian-mujahideen-brigades-gaza-latam-intl,Israel says it has killed leader of Palestinian militant group that took part in October 7 attack,2025-06-08 00:28:53,"The Israeli military says it has killed the leader of a Palestinian militant group that took part in the October 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel.
Asaad Abu Sharia, who led the Palestinian Mujahideen Movement and its armed wing the Mujahideen Brigades, was killed in a joint operation with Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Saturday.
His death and that of his brother Ahmed Abu Sharia were confirmed by the militant group hours after Gaza’s Civil Defense reported that an Israeli airstrike had hit their family home in the Sabra area of Gaza City.
Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV said the strike killed at least 15 people and injured several. Video showed people searching through the debris of a demolished four-story house.
The Mujahideen Brigades took part in the October 7 attacks alongside Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups and took hostage some of the most high-profile captives, including a family whose suffering became a symbol of the attack.
According to the Israeli military, Sharia was among the militant leaders who stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small Israeli community near the Gaza border where many residents were killed or taken hostage during the brutal assault that led to Israel’s war in Gaza.
Despite not being aware of Hamas’ plans in advance, fighters from the jihadist group joined in the cross-border assault “as an extension of the Hamas attack,” the Israeli military said.
According to Israel, Sharia was directly involved in the abduction and murders of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas – a mother and two sons who were among the most recognizable victims of the attack, partly because of the young ages of Kfir and Ariel, who were nine months and four years old respectively at the time.
Kfir was the youngest hostage kidnapped into Gaza and the youngest to have been killed. The boys’ mother, Shiri, was 32 at the time of her kidnap. Their father Yarden was also captured, but was released alive in February after 484 days in captivity.
Reacting to news of Sharia’s killing, the Bibas family expressed their “heartfelt gratitude” to the Israeli military, saying his death was “another step on the journey towards closure.”
“While Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir cannot be brought back, we find some measure of comfort knowing these despicable murderers will not harm another family,” the Bibas family said in a statement shared via the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
Israel’s military said Sharia was also involved in the abduction of the Israeli-American couple Gad Haggai and Judi Lynn Weinstein Haggai, and the abduction and killing of Thai national Nattapong Pinta.
The Israeli-American couple were killed near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the attack in 2023. The body of Nattapong, an agricultural worker who was abducted alive on October 7, was recovered from southern Gaza in a military operation on Friday.
Israel said it believes the Mujahideen Brigades are still holding the body of an additional foreign national. The group has previously denied killing its captives.","['Jonny Hallam', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Lauren Izso']",en

The announcement comes just days after Israel recovered the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages from Gaza.
Pinta, 35, was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel where he had been working in agriculture, according to an Israeli military official, who said it is estimated that he was killed during the first months of captivity. Pinta was a husband and father working in Israel to support his family in Thailand, the official said.
“We will not rest until all the hostages, living and deceased, are returned home,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.
“The state of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of Nattapong’s family and of the entire Thai people,” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog in a statement shared on social media Saturday evening.
Pinta was abducted by the Mujahideen, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, a militant group that took part in the Hamas-led October 7 terror attack on Israel. The IDF said it is the same organization that kidnapped the Bibas family and killed Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas, the mother and two young sons who became the most prominent among Hamas’ captives.
Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Saturday that it was “deeply saddened” by the news of Pinta’s death.
“The Royal Thai Embassy in Tel Aviv was informed by a representative of the Israeli government that Mr. Nattapong Pinta, the last Thai hostage, has been confirmed dead,” Nikorndej Balankura, a spokesperson for the ministry, said in a video statement.
Earlier this week, Israel announced that the bodies of Judy Winston-Haggai, 70, and Gadi Haggai, 72, were recovered from southern Gaza. The two were also taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz. The couple had four children and seven grandchildren.
The retrieval of Pinta’s body comes with an intense Israeli operation underway in Gaza, with the Civil Defense reporting at least 38 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Friday.
The IDF said four soldiers were killed and five wounded early Friday morning when an explosive was detonated in a building in Khan Younis in which they were operating, causing part of the structure to collapse.
A total of 55 hostages remain in Gaza, including one taken in 2014. Twenty are believed to still be alive.
Of the 251 people taken hostage by Hamas militants on October 7, many were migrant workers from poor rural parts of Asia, who had gone to work in Israel’s agricultural, construction and health care sectors to send money back home.",['Oren Liebermann'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/middleeast/israel-arming-hamas-rivals-gaza-intl,Israel confirms it is arming Hamas rivals in operation opposition calls ‘complete madness’,2025-06-06 13:50:21,"Israel is arming local militias in Gaza in an effort to counter Hamas in the besieged enclave, officials say, as opposition politicians warned that the move endangers national security.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the covert enterprise on Thursday, calling it “a good thing.” In a video posted on social media, Netanyahu said Israel had “activated clans in Gaza which oppose Hamas,” and that it was done “under the advice of security elements.”
Former defense minister and Netanyahu rival Avigdor Liberman divulged the move on Israel’s Ch. 12 News on Wednesday, saying that Israel was distributing rifles to extremist groups in Gaza and describing the operation as “complete madness.”
“We’re talking about the equivalent of ISIS in Gaza,” Liberman said one day later on Israel’s Army Radio, adding that Israel is providing weapons to “crime families in Gaza on Netanyahu’s orders.”
“No one can guarantee that these weapons will not be directed towards Israel,” he said, a warning echoed by one of the officials who spoke with CNN. After Liberman’s revelation, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement saying, “Israel is acting to defeat Hamas in various ways upon the recommendation of the heads of the security establishment.”
The ongoing operation was authorized by Netanyahu without security cabinet approval, two officials told CNN, which is the normal forum for making major policy decisions. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners would likely have vetoed such a move.
Meanwhile, Hamas said the plan revealed “a grave and undeniable truth.” In a statement, the militant group said: “The Israeli occupation army is arming criminal gangs in the Gaza Strip with the aim of creating a state of insecurity and social chaos.”
One group that has received weapons from Israel is the militia led by Yasser Abu Shabab, officials said. Abu Shabab heads an armed group that controls some territory in eastern Rafah and he has posted photos of himself holding an AK-47 rifle with UN vehicles behind him. Though Abu Shabab has denied receiving weapons from Israel, Hamas has accused him of being a “traitor.”
“We pledge before God to continue confronting the dens of that criminal and his gang, no matter the cost of the sacrifices we make,” Hamas said on Thursday.
Opposition politicians ripped Netanyahu for the plan to arm militias and the secrecy around it, lambasting it as a continuation of the Israeli leader’s decision to allow millions of dollars in cash to travel from Qatar to Gaza beginning in late 2018. They accused him of strengthening Hamas in the past as an alternative to the rival Palestinian Fatah faction, and now arming gangs as an alternative to Hamas.
“After Netanyahu finished handing over millions of dollars to Hamas, he moved on to supplying weapons to groups in Gaza affiliated with ISIS – all improvised, with no strategic planning, and all leading to more disasters,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said on social media.
Netanyahu has not laid out a plan for who will govern Gaza in the future and has hardly made clear any of his post-war intentions for the coastal enclave. Part of Israel’s war goals include the complete disarmament of Hamas and the end of its ability to govern in the territory.
The arming of militias in Gaza appears to be the closest that Netanyahu has come to empowering any form of alternate rule.
Despite nearly 20 months of war, Israel has not been able to dislodge Hamas completely from large swaths of Gaza, and the militant group – classified as a terrorist organization in Israel, the United States, and the European Union – has clung to power.
Yair Golan, head of the left-wing Democrats party, said in a post on social media: “Instead of bringing about a deal, making arrangements with the moderate Sunni axis, and returning the hostages and security to Israeli citizens, he is creating a new ticking bomb in Gaza.”",[],en

The Israeli attack marked its biggest escalation in Lebanon since the US-brokered a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in November.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was striking “terror targets of the Hezbollah Aerial Unit (127)” in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh.
NNA news reported strikes from Israeli drones, saying that a “series of warning strikes, numbering more than seven” had targeted the city’s southern suburbs. The news outlet also said that Israeli drones carried out an airstrike on the town of Ain Qana in Lebanon’s Iklim Tuffah region.
There were no initial reports of casualties related to the strikes, the spokesperson for Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health told CNN early on Friday morning.
The Israeli military had previously warned of a coming strike in the area, intended to target alleged “underground UAV production facilities” controlled by Hezbollah.
IDF Arabic Spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued an “urgent warning” via social media earlier on Thursday, urging residents of “Al-Hadath, Haret Hreik, and Burj Al-Barajneh,” neighborhoods to immediately evacuate buildings marked in red on attached maps and adjacent structures, and to stay at least “300 meters (328 yards) away” for safety.
A second “urgent warning” was issued by the Israeli military via a post on X accompanied by a satellite photo of Lebanon with highlighted zones they said showed the locations of Hezbollah sites. The warning urged residents to evacuate nearby buildings “immediately and stay at least 500 meters away from them.”
The announcement prompted widespread panic and evacuations, according to NNA. Social media video captured Thursday night showed dozens of cars leaving neighborhoods in the city’s south.
The strikes were carried out as Muslims in Lebanon prepared to celebrate Eid al-Adha, known as the Feast of Sacrifice, on Friday. Most Muslims in Lebanon usually celebrate the eve of Eid which fell on Thursday evening local time.
The Lebanese army warned that it could suspend its cooperation with a committee led by the United States and France to monitor the ceasefire provisions that include disarming Hezbollah.
Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam both condemned the Israeli strikes, with Aoun saying that they were a “blatant violation of an international agreement, as well as the basic tenets of international and humanitarian laws and resolutions” on the eve of an important religious occasion.
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz responded to Aoun, saying: “Mr. President – there will be no calm in Beirut, no order and stability in Lebanon without security for the State of Israel. Agreements must be respected. If you do not do what is required – we will continue to act, and with great force.”
Lebanon’s new government has vowed to disarm paramilitary groups in the country such as Hezbollah and Palestinian factions. Last week, Salam said that his government had dismantled 500 pieces of weaponry north of the Litani river in southern Lebanon.
Israel previously struck the same neighborhood, a Hezbollah stronghold, in late March. A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon had been brokered in November 2024, but strikes on southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah militants and facilities have continued.

Prior to this, the longest ban for a lawmaker from New Zealand’s Parliament was three days. The widely unpopular treaty bill, which the suspended lawmakers said would reverse Indigenous rights, has already been defeated.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Travel ban
President Donald Trump signed a proclamation last night to ban travel from 12 countries to the US, citing the need to protect the country from “foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats.” The travel ban, which will take effect at 12:01 a.m. on June 9, will restrict the entry of nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar (also known as Burma), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. People from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will face a partial restriction. During his first term, Trump barred travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations from coming to the US. That policy was challenged in court before President Joe Biden repealed it in 2021.
2. Israel-Hamas war
The US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an “immediate, unconditional and permanent” ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the “unconditional lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.” The US was the only council member nation to oppose the resolution on Wednesday. As for humanitarian aid, a controversial organization backed by the US and Israel issued a 24-hour pause on aid after Palestinians en route to the distribution sites came under fire. Earlier today, the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages kidnapped by Hamas were returned to Israel. Judy Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and Gadi Haggai, 72, were killed near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Their remains were recovered during a military operation.
3. Universities
President Trump continued his feud with Ivy League schools on Wednesday by signing a proclamation to suspend international visas for new students at Harvard University. The move came after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to not make any changes to Harvard’s international student visa program indefinitely. The administration has demanded that Harvard change its hiring and admission requirements, eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and alter rules for on-campus protests. But the school has resisted those orders and filed a lawsuit claiming the government’s actions violate the First Amendment. Harvard wasn’t the only target of the Trump administration’s ire on Wednesday. The Department of Education also threatened Columbia University’s accreditation for allegedly tolerating antisemitism on campus. Accreditation is needed for students to gain access to federal money, including grants and loans. Columbia said it was “aware of the concerns raised” and had already addressed them.
4. Manhunt
A manhunt is underway for a person suspected of committing a triple homicide. Authorities are searching for Travis Decker, 32, a former Army soldier with “extensive training” who is wanted for the kidnapping and murder of his children. Last Friday, the mother of his three daughters, ages 9, 8 and 5, reported that Decker had not returned them following a planned visit. His pickup truck was discovered, unoccupied, on Monday near a campground west of Leavenworth, Washington. The girls’ bodies were found about 75 to 100 yards away from the vehicle, The Seattle Times reported. A reward of up to $20,000 has been offered for information leading to Decker’s arrest.
5. Oil spill
An estimated 2,000 gallons of dyed diesel have stained part of Baltimore’s waterfront red. According to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott, the fuel originated at a Johns Hopkins Hospital facility in East Baltimore. When Hopkins reported the spill on Wednesday morning, the facility estimated it was 100 gallons. Seven hours later, that amount was increased to about 2,000 gallons. Emergency crews from nearly a dozen state and city agencies have been working through the night with the US Coast Guard to remove the red-tinted fuel from the water.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/middleeast/israel-hostages-gaza-recovered-intl,Bodies of two Israeli-American hostages recovered from Gaza in joint military operation,2025-06-05 07:33:43,"The bodies of two Israeli-American hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 were recovered from southern Gaza during a military operation, according to a statement from Israeli military and the Shin Bet security agency.
Judy Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and Gadi Haggai, 72, were killed near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack on southern Israel in 2023.
“Together with all the citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our deepest condolences to the dear families,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.
The prime minister thanked the soldiers and commanders involved in the operation and vowed to return all remaining hostages held in Gaza.
“We will not rest and we will not be silent until all our hostages – both the living and the fallen – are brought home,” he said.
A spokesperson for kibbutz Nir Oz said the bodies of the two hostages had been returned to Israel overnight and would be laid to rest.
The couple had four children and seven grandchildren.
In a statement the Kibbutz remembered Gadi as “a sharp-minded man, a gifted wind instrument player since the age of three, deeply connected to the land, a chef and advocate of healthy vegan nutrition and sports,” and Judy as “a poet, entrepreneur, creative spirit, and devoted advocate for peace and coexistence.”
A statement from the family, provided by the Nir Oz spokesperson expressed gratitude for the return of their missing loved ones.
“We are grateful for the closure we have been granted and for the return of our loved ones for burial – they went out for a walk on that Black Saturday morning and never came back. In this emotional moment, we want to thank the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and security forces who carried out this complex rescue operation and have been fighting for us for over a year and a half, and to everyone who supported, struggled, prayed, and fought for us and for all the people of Israel,” it said.
The family also thanked the US administration, the Israeli government and the FBI for their “tireless work and ongoing support.”
“Still, our hearts will not be whole until all 12 hostages from Nir Oz – and all 56 hostages – are brought home,” the statement added.
Heartbreak and healing
A total of 56 hostages remain in Gaza, including one taken in 2014. Twenty are believed to still be alive.
Throughout 20 months of war in the territory, the rescue of hostages and the recovery of bodies has happened on only a few occasions. In late-March, Israeli forces recovered “findings” related to Manny Goddard, whose body was taken into Gaza after he was killed by members of Islamic Jihad on October 7, according to the IDF and the Shin Bet.
In January, Israeli forces recovered the body of soldier Oron Shaul, who was killed during a battle in the enclave in July 2014. The remains of another soldier killed during the same conflict remain in Gaza.
Israel’s Hostages and Missing Families Forum welcomed the latest news, calling it both heartbreaking and healing.
“Their return reminds us all that it is the state’s duty to bring everyone home, so that we, the families, together with all the people of Israel, can begin the process of healing and recovery,” a statement from the forum said.
“Decision-makers must do everything necessary to reach an agreement that will return all 56 remaining hostages – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for burial,” it added.
Bringing back all hostages still in Gaza is among Israel’s primary war goals, along with the destruction of Hamas. The release of hostages has been a key point in mediated negotiations aimed toward a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group.","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Lucas Lilieholm', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/middleeast/israel-military-gaza-aid-shooting-intl-invs,CNN review sheds new light on deadly Gaza aid site shooting,2025-06-05 00:00:03,"Editor’s Note: This story contains graphic images and descriptions of violence.
A CNN investigation into a deadly incident near an aid distribution site in southern Gaza on Sunday points to the Israeli military opening fire on crowds of Palestinians as they tried to make their way to the fenced enclosure to get food.
More than a dozen eyewitnesses, including those wounded in the attack, said Israeli troops shot at crowds in volleys of gunfire that occurred sporadically through the early hours of Sunday morning. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the US and Israeli-backed aid initiative that runs the site, said that Israeli forces were operating in the area during the same period.
Multiple videos geolocated by CNN place the gunfire near a roundabout where hundreds of Palestinians had gathered about half a mile (800 meters) away from the militarized aid site in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah. The designated route to the site along the coast, Al-Rasheed Street, is in an area under the Israeli military’s control and Israeli troops operate at a base nearby.
Weapons experts said the rate of gunfire heard in the footage, as well as images of bullets retrieved from victims, were consistent with machine guns used by the Israeli military that can be mounted on tanks. Multiple eyewitnesses said that they saw gunfire emanating from Israeli tanks nearby.
None of the videos definitively show who fired shots outside of the aid camp. However, CNN’s review of audiovisual material sheds fresh light on how the pursuit of aid turned chaotic and then dangerous, on the actions of Israeli forces and the consequences of the new aid mechanism, which has been mired in controversy.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially said on Sunday that its forces did not fire at civilians “while they were near or within the aid site.” An Israeli military source later acknowledged that troops had fired “warning shots” at suspects about 1 kilometer (1,093 yards) away.
The Israeli military declined to answer questions about CNN’s findings.
During a press conference on Tuesday, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said the military investigated and found its troops played no role in any mass casualty event. Defrin said: “This week, it was claimed that the IDF fired at civilians in an aid distribution area. This report is entirely false and echoes the propaganda of the terrorist organization Hamas… Regarding the incident on Sunday – it simply didn’t happen!”
Defrin also suggested casualty figures provided by the Palestinian health ministry were inflated, but did not elaborate as to how many people the military believed had been killed or injured.
Sunday’s mass shooting, which the Palestinian health ministry said killed at least 31 Palestinians and injured dozens, was the deadliest incident involving aid distribution in recent months. It comes amid warnings from the United Nations that the new aid distribution mechanism has become a “death trap” for desperate people seeking food in the strip.
Thousands of starving Palestinians had gathered in the sandy bulldozed area near the GHF-run site before the gates opened on Sunday, braving chaotic scenes when gunfire struck the crowd.
“No one move, stay in your place… no one move!” one Palestinian man is heard yelling in a series of videos posted to TikTok on Sunday, filmed along the coast where crowds had gathered near the aid site.
The videos – reviewed and geolocated by CNN – capture Palestinians taking cover amid repeated bursts of gunfire, and what appear to be two explosive munitions seen landing next to the crowd.
Mohammed Saqer, 43, told CNN in an interview that he only narrowly escaped death, watching people around him get shot in the head as he crouched on the ground, hoping to survive long enough to reach the site run by GHF and get food for his family.
After the US-backed private foundation finally opened the site at 5:00 a.m., witnesses said the Israeli military’s gunfire continued nearby. Surveillance footage shared by GHF shows crowds of onrushing Palestinians scrambling to reach the limited boxes of food as tracer fire explodes into the night sky in the distance.
By sunrise, the extent of the catastrophe was undeniable. Videos captured bloodied bodies of Palestinians scattered across the sands, roughly a half mile from the food distribution center.
Similar deadly incidents on Monday and Tuesday near the same site have raised further questions about whether the militarized aid initiative backed by the US and approved by Israel can deliver food supplies safely. In the subsequent episodes, the IDF acknowledged that Israeli troops had fired warning shots in the area. GHF said none of the shootings occurred within or adjacent to their distribution sites, adding that the location of the shootings was “an area well beyond our secure distribution site.”
For Saqer, who said he managed to finally reach the aid site and escaped with whatever he could carry, the harrowing night still weighs heavily on him.
“We survived a night that was worse than we could imagine,” he said. “The reality for people was one of death and hunger searching for food.”
Videos capture deadly chaos
When GHF announced its distribution plans for Sunday, the instructions were direct: only one aid site would be open starting at 5:00 a.m., and the IDF would be present in the area to secure passage on a designated route.
It also warned – albeit after gunfire reportedly already erupted – that the Israeli military would be “active” in the area ahead of the site’s opening.
“Using the passage before 5:00 a.m. is prohibited, as we were informed by the military that it will be active in the area before and after the specified safe hours,” the GHF said in a release on Facebook at 4 a.m. “We remind all residents to stay on the road — straying from it poses a significant danger.”
Having endured an 11-week Israeli blockade of humanitarian aid, thousands of desperate Palestinians began making their way down Al-Rasheed Street in hopes of being among the first to reach the aid site – the only one operating in all of Gaza that day – before the limited supplies ran out.
As people attempted to slowly advance to the aid site from the Al-Alam roundabout, more than a dozen witnesses interviewed by CNN described the IDF opening volleys of intense fire on the crowd starting as early as 3:30 a.m.
“I could hear the screams of young people and others from their injuries,” Saqer said. “In front of me were four young men with direct injuries to the head… there was a person next to me who was injured by a bullet in his eye.”
He and others said a quadcopter drone appeared above the crowd, with the voice on its speaker telling people to turn around. But amid the warning, gunfire crackled all around them.
“Even retreating was almost impossible, and everyone was lying on the ground unable to lift their heads because if you lifted your head, you would get shot.”
As the chaos unfolded near the Al-Alam area, the GHF aid site officially opened at 5:00 a.m. Security video of the location released by the organization, which was labeled as beginning at 5:02 a.m., shows crowds of Palestinians running into the fenced distribution center.
Three minutes later, in the background of the video, bursts of tracer gunfire are seen overhead, which forensics experts told CNN appear to be outgoing from an area near the distribution site. In the video, which has no audio, crowds can be seen running in another direction nearby. It is unclear whether they are running from gunfire.
Around the same time back in the Al-Alam area approximately 800 meters (874 yards) away, 30-year-old Ameen Khalifa was filming as he took cover. Several videos shared on TikTok by Khalifa show groups of Palestinians lying flat on the ground and taking cover from ongoing bursts of automatic gunfire. CNN geolocated the video to the area using visible spotlights at the Egyptian border and the unfinished hospital that became an Israeli military base.
Robert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined the footage for CNN and said that the bursts of gunfire were at a rate of 15 and 16 shots per second (or 900 and 960 per minute), fired from a distance of about a quarter of a mile (450 meters).
Based on the erratic nature of the sound, Maher said that the shots seemed to be spread out, fired repeatedly in one direction. “Since the cracks are irregular, it seems more like the gunfire was being sprayed over the area.”
Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member, said the rate of fire was consistent with the FN MAG, a heavily-used machine gun in the Israeli military’s arsenal. The FN MAG is commonly equipped on the IDF’s Merkava tanks, which several eyewitnesses said they saw open fire on the crowds.
Ball told CNN he could not confirm the specific weaponry used, or who fired it, but the rate of fire, he said, indicated it wasn’t consistent with machine guns used by Hamas.
Ball also said the tracer fire – ammunition containing a pyrotechnic charge illuminating its trajectory – seen in the GHF’s footage is consistent with the use of machine guns. “Typically belt fed machine guns have tracer rounds inserted every few rounds. So while only 3 tracers are visible in the video, more rounds were fired.”
Khalifa, who loved sports and bodybuilding, survived the harrowing night on Sunday only to be shot and killed by a drone two days later while heading to the same aid site to look for food, one of his close friends told CNN.
By daylight, video footage reviewed by CNN captured the dire scene near the coast, with several bodies strewn in the sand. The Palestinian health ministry said that more than 200 casualties reached hospitals, including dozens with serious injuries. It added that all of those killed had been shot in the head or chest.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said that its nearby field hospital was overwhelmed by patients, describing the carnage as the “highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident” since it opened over a year ago. Other dead and wounded were taken to Nasser Hospital.
“It’s difficult to describe what we saw with the young and the old, there was severe injuries to the head, severe injuries to the lung,” recalled Dr. Ahmad Abou-Sweid, an Australian working at the Nasser medical complex.
“There was a heavy proportion of head-targeted injuries from bullet wounds.”
Doctors working at Nasser Hospital shared photos with CNN of the bullets retrieved from patients injured and killed in the attack, which weapons experts say appear to match the type of ammunition used in the Israeli military’s machine guns. “This bullet is consistent with the NATO standard 7.62mm M80, which would be fired by IDF 7.62x51mm weapons, including the Negev 7.62 and FN MAG,” Ball said of one of the images.
GHF, which runs the site, insisted: “There was no gunfire in the (distribution) center and also not in the surrounding area.”
“All aid was distributed today without incident. We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.”
The IDF said allegations that Israeli soldiers fired on Gazans near or within the aid distribution site were “false reports.” It added: “Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false.”
An Israeli military source told CNN that IDF troops did fire warning shots towards suspects approaching their position approximately a kilometer (1,100 yards) away from the aid distribution site in an incident that happened several hours before the site opened.
Ihab Musleh told CNN he had taken his two young sons along to the aid distribution center. When he told them to stay put at a nearby hill as he went inside the site, he heard more gunfire and rushed back out.
Yazeed, 13, was shot in the stomach by gunfire from an Israeli tank and survived his injuries, according to his dad.
“He was waving his hands towards the tank and within seconds, he was hit with gunfire and fell to the ground,” Musleh said, speaking to CNN from the hospital where his son was being treated.
Other witnesses told CNN they were either injured or saw intense gunfire in the area after the aid site opened.
Mohammad Abu Rezeq was shot in the stomach upon arriving at Al-Alam where he said Israeli forces were deliberately targeting the crowd.
“I have seen a lot of soldiers in this war. When they want to clear an area or warn you, they shoot around you. But yesterday, they were shooting to kill us,” Abu Rezeq said.
CNN asked the IDF about the claim from witnesses that its troops were firing directly at crowds, shooting to kill, but it gave no further comment beyond its published statement.
Not an isolated incident
The chaos in the early hours of Sunday morning was not an isolated incident. In consecutive days since, Palestinians attempting to reach the GHF’s aid distribution sites have come under fire by the Israeli military.
After the intense gunfire near the Al-Alam roundabout on Sunday, GHF’s Facebook posts included updated maps of the safe route for the following days. The new maps included a large, red stop sign at Al-Alam.
On Tuesday, nearly 30 people were killed and dozens wounded while making their way to the aid sites in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health and Nasser Hospital.
The Israeli military said that its forces opened fire multiple times after identifying “several suspects moving toward them, deviating from the designated access routes.”
“The troops carried out warning fire, and after the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced toward the troops,” the IDF said in a statement, adding they were looking into reports of casualties.
While the Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots in the area three days in a row, posts from GHF’s Facebook page show the organization works in close coordination with the IDF to establish safe, defined routes.
GHF was set up amid Israeli accusations that Hamas is stealing aid in Gaza and profiting from sales, though Israel hasn’t presented any evidence publicly to back up the claim.
UN aid groups, such as UNRWA, typically check identification and rely on a database of registered families when distributing aid.
But GHF is not screening Palestinians at aid distribution sites, despite Israeli officials saying that additional security measures were a core reason for the creation of the new program.
UN aid agencies have criticized GHF’s aid mechanism, saying it violates humanitarian principles and raises the risks for Palestinians.
Criticism has been mounting against both Israel and GHF after chaos broke out last week when tens of thousands of starving Palestinians arrived at two new food distribution sites.
The UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, was scathing in his assessment to the UN Security Council late last month.
“It restricts aid to only one part of Gaza, while leaving other dire needs unmet,” he said.
“It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/middleeast/gaza-aid-operation-24-hour-pause-intl,Controversial Gaza aid operation pauses for 24 hours after days of deadly shootings,2025-06-04 14:52:15,"The distribution of aid from a controversial new US- and Israel-backed organization into Gaza was paused for 24 hours on Wednesday after Palestinians en route to a distribution site came under fire for three straight days, with fatal consequences.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said that its hubs would be closed due to logistical work to better handle the massive number of people arriving in the hope of collecting food, and so the Israeli military could make “preparations on the access routes to the centers.” Distribution at the sites is expected to resume Thursday.
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) warned Palestinians, who endured an 11-week blockade on aid into the strip followed by a meager trickle of food and supplies in the past couple of weeks, to stay away from the GHF sites. “Movement tomorrow on the roads leading to the distribution centers is strictly prohibited, as these are considered combat zones,” the military’s Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.
A spokesperson for GHF said the organization was “actively engaged” in talks with the Israeli military to improve security beyond the perimeter of the humanitarian zone. GHF asked the IDF to introduce measures to guide foot traffic away from military positions, develop clearer guidance to allow the population to move safely to the aid sites, and to “enhance IDF force training and refine internal IDF procedures to support safety,” the spokesperson said.
The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli agency coordinating the passage of aid into Gaza, said 157 trucks with food and flour entered the enclave on Tuesday. These truckloads of humanitarian aid have supplied both GHF and the United Nations, which has continued to deliver aid after GHF began operating. But it remains a fraction of the 500-600 trucks that entered Gaza before the war, according to the UN.
GHF got off to a rocky start when its first executive director resigned the day before operations began last Monday, citing concerns over impartiality and urging Israel to allow more aid into the blockaded enclave.
US military veteran Jake Wood quit as GHF’s head after just a matter of weeks at the organization, publicly launched by the United States in early May. The foundation appointed evangelical Christian leader Rev. Johnnie Moore as its new director on Tuesday, who promised to expand the distribution effort in Gaza.
“GHF is demonstrating that it is possible to move vast quantities of food to people who need it most – safely, efficiently, and effectively,” Moore said in a statement Tuesday.
The organization has repeatedly said there has been no violence at their sites but acknowledged on Tuesday that there have been incidents along the approach routes to the centers. “This was an area well beyond our secure distribution site,” GHF said.
Dozens of Palestinians have died after coming under Israeli fire in recent days, Palestinian authorities say. On Tuesday, nearly 30 people were killed, and dozens wounded, according to the Palestinian health officials. The IDF said its forces opened fire multiple times after identifying “several suspects moving toward them, deviating from the designated access routes.”
A day earlier, three Palestinians were shot dead and dozens wounded as they were on their way to access aid, Palestinian and hospital authorities said. The Israeli military said that its forces fired warning shots approximately a kilometer (about 1,100 yards) from the GHF site.
On Sunday, the Palestinian health ministry, hospital officials and a half-dozen eyewitnesses said the Israeli military was responsible for gunfire that killed 31 people. At the time, the IDF said its forces “did not fire at civilians while they were near or within” the aid site, but an Israeli military source acknowledged that Israeli forces fired toward individuals about a kilometer away, before the aid site opened.
Most established aid organizations and the UN have refused to work with GHF saying it fails to meet core humanitarian principles and citing concerns that its limited distribution points in the south of the strip would further the military goals of Israel to remove Gaza’s population from the north.
The UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, was scathing in his assessment of the foundation during a UN Security Council meeting earlier this month.
“It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is a cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement,” Fletcher said.
But GHF has doubled down on its distribution mechanism. The organization said Tuesday: “We remain focused on one thing: getting food to the people who need it most. And right now, we are the only organization doing that at scale, with consistency and safety.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/03/middleeast/gaza-aid-distribution-deadly-what-to-know-latam-intl,Aid distribution in Gaza has turned deadly. Here’s what to know,2025-06-03 19:19:35,"A new program for getting desperately needed food into the hands of starving Palestinians in Gaza is only days old, but it’s already mired in chaos and tragedy.
Dozens of Palestinians have been killed over the past few days while on their way to trying to obtain aid from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). This group, backed by Israel and the US, is intended to replace the UN-led system of distributing aid in Gaza, to address a hunger crisis sparked by a months-long Israeli blockade.
Over the past week, tens of thousands of Palestinians have converged on distribution points run by GHF, hoping to grab one of the limited number of packages before they run out.
Palestinian authorities and witnesses accused Israeli forces of shooting dozens of civilians dead near one of the aid sites in Rafah on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
On Monday and Tuesday, Israel’s military said it fired “warning shots” toward what were described as “suspects” approaching a military position, and the military was looking into reports of casualties. On Sunday, during the first deadly shooting, the military said it did not fire at civilians “near or within” the distribution site, even as a military source admitted Israeli forces fired towards individuals about a kilometer away from the site.
GHF announced that the distribution sites would be closed on Wednesday because of logistical preparations to better handle the massive number of people arriving and for the Israeli military to make “preparations on the access routes to the centers.” The closure is expected to last for one day.
As international condemnation grows, here’s what to know about aid and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
What is the situation with food in Gaza?
Israel halted all humanitarian aid into Gaza in early March, with government officials saying their goal was to force Hamas to accept new ceasefire terms and release hostages taken during the militant group’s terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
The ban meant no supplies entered the territory for 11 weeks, pushing Gaza’s 2.1 million people deeper into a hunger crisis. A UN-backed report warned in late April that one in five people were facing starvation and that the entire Gaza Strip was edging closer to famine.
Faced with growing international pressure, Israel eased its blockade two weeks ago, allowing a small amount of aid to enter Gaza, to be distributed through UN channels as well as through GHF. But the amount of aid trickling in is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of the population, according to Palestinian officials and international aid groups.
On the first day of GHF’s delivery in southern Gaza last Tuesday, chaos broke out, as thousands of Palestinians rushed to receive food supplies, with Israeli troops firing warning shots into the air and the US contractors overseeing the site briefly withdrawing.
Gaza’s hunger crisis long predates Israel’s total blockade, however. Since Hamas’ attack, Israel has severely restricted the amount of aid that can enter the strip. And even before October 2023, Israel and Egypt had imposed a partial blockade on Gaza, meaning that 63% of the population was food insecure, according to the UN.
What is GHF?
GHF is a private, non-profit organization created with the backing of Israel and the US to take over aid delivery in Gaza, following Israeli accusations that Hamas was stealing some of the humanitarian aid that was destined for civilians. GHF relies on private military contractors for security and aims to replace traditional methods of aid delivery in Gaza employed by humanitarian organizations.
On Tuesday, the organization doubled down on its mechanism, saying its work continues “full-steam ahead” as it asserts it has delivered millions of meals in pre-packaged boxes to Palestinians. “In an operating environment as complex and volatile as Gaza, that kind of safe, direct, and large-scale aid delivery is unprecedented,” GHF said in a statement.
The group has faced internal turmoil – its executive director, Jake Wood, quit the day before GHF began operations in Gaza, and in a further blow, the Boston Consulting Group confirmed on Tuesday that it had canceled its contract with GHF.
The organization appointed evangelical Christian leader Rev. Johnnie Moore as its new executive director on Tuesday. A strong supporter of US President Donald Trump, Moore has visited the White House on numerous occasions and prayed over Trump in the Oval Office earlier this year.
Moore has also previously praised a controversial Trump proposal for the US to “take over” Gaza, stating on X in February: “The USA will take full responsibility for future of Gaza, giving everyone hope & a future.”
The foundation set up four “Secure Distribution Sites” in southern and central Gaza aiming to feed around 1.2 million of Gaza’s estimated 2.1 million population. That pales in comparison to the United Nations system, which relies on some 400 aid distribution points dotted up and down Gaza.
The foundation coordinates with the Israeli military to designate specific routes for traveling Palestinians – many of whom must walk a long way through the devastated strip to get food – and issues warnings on Facebook against diverging from the designated roads.
But it’s unclear how many of those people are aware of these detailed instructions, nor how access to one of the hubs, designated SDS-01, takes them close to positions of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Over the past three nights, Palestinians appear to have come too near to these positions, and the IDF said Tuesday it had opened fire towards people who had left the designated route.
The United Nations had warned that the Israeli military’s involvement in securing the areas around the sites could discourage participation or lead to recipients facing reprisals.
How has aid distribution changed and why?
Before GHF arrived in Gaza, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) were the main distributors of aid in the enclave. Additionally, UNWRA took a leading role in providing education and healthcare services.
But Israel has long had a contentious relationship with UNRWA and the UN at large. This relationship ruptured completely in the aftermath of the October 7 attack.
Israel’s parliament subsequently banned UNRWA from operating in the country, making any UN-led humanitarian efforts extremely difficult.
Both Israel and the US had also accused Hamas of stealing aid distributed by the UN. Hamas has rejected those claims, and humanitarian aid organizations say most of the food aid reaches civilians.
The UN has refused to participate in the new Gaza aid initiative, saying that GHF model violates some basic humanitarian principles. It warned that locating the initial distribution points only in southern and central Gaza could be perceived as encouraging Israel’s publicly stated goal of depopulating northern Gaza.
GHF has said it is working to open new sites, including in northern Gaza, but no such distribution points have yet opened.
What has been happening recently?
There is not enough food for everyone who needs it. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forced to seek aid from a tiny number of sites – and while a lucky few have been able to secure some relief, for most, the results have been disastrous.
Palestinian authorities have said more than 60 people have been killed by Israeli forces in the past three days near a GHF aid site near the southern city of Rafah.
Establishing exactly what happened at all these incidents is difficult, as Israel prevents international media from entering Gaza.
On Tuesday, nearly 30 people were killed, and dozens wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health and Nasser hospital. The Israeli military said its forces opened fire multiple times after identifying “several suspects moving toward them, deviating from the designated access routes.”
On Monday, three Palestinians were shot dead and dozens wounded as they were on their way to access aid, Palestinian and hospital authorities said. The IDF said that Israeli forces fired warning shots approximately a kilometer (about 1,100 yards) from the aid distribution site.
On Sunday, the Palestinian health ministry, hospital officials and a half-dozen eyewitnesses said the Israeli military was responsible for gunfire that Palestinian officials said killed 31 people.
At the time, the Israeli military said its forces “did not fire at civilians while they were near or within” the aid site, but an Israeli military source acknowledged that Israeli forces fired toward individuals about a kilometer away, before the aid site opened.
GHF said on Sunday that none of the gunfire was in the distribution center itself or the surrounding area. After Tuesday’s shooting, the organization directed questions about shootings near the aid site to the IDF.
“This was an area well beyond our secure distribution site. We recognize the tragic nature of the situation and remain committed to ensuring the safety of all civilians during humanitarian operations at all of our sites,” GHF said in a statement.
What has the reaction been?
There has been widespread international condemnation, particularly from the UN.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday he was “appalled” by the reports of deaths and injuries on Sunday.
“It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food,” Guterres said in a statement, calling for “an immediate and independent investigation” into the events and “for perpetrators to be held accountable.”
The UN human rights chief, Volker Turk, said on Tuesday that Palestinians have been given “the grimmest of choices: die from starvation or risk being killed while trying to access the meagre food that is being made available through Israel’s militarized humanitarian assistance mechanism.”
In a post on X, Philippe Lazzarini, executive director of UNRWA, also slammed the new mechanism, saying: “aid distribution has become a death trap. Mass casualties including scores of injured & killed among starving civilians due to gunshots this morning. This is according to reports from international medics on ground.”
The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, last week criticized the new aid mechanism run by GHF, saying the EU does not support “any kind of privatization of the distribution of humanitarian aid.”
The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, and Canada have also threatened to take “concrete action,” including targeted sanctions, if Israel does not stop its renewed military offensive and continues to block aid from entering Gaza.","['Mostafa Salem', 'Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/03/us/jewish-americans-antisemitism,Fear in America’s Jewish community intensifies after latest antisemitic attack,2025-06-03 20:06:02,"Like many Jewish Americans, Hannah Gay Keao has been living on edge and fear of antisemitism since Hamas’ deadly October 7 terrorist attack on Israel.
But when her daughter asked why she was sad hours after a man targeted Jewish people and set them on fire at a community event in Boulder, Colorado, Gay Keao paused.
The firebombing attack happened just 25 miles from where Gay Keao serves on the Edgewater city council, and she said she searched for a way to explain the antisemitism unfolding in their backyard in terms the 4-year-old could understand.
“She’s Jewish,” Gay Keao said. “It’s important for her to know the realities of the world.”
Jewish leaders have been alarmed by the historic rise in antisemitic threats since the war between Israel and Hamas began in 2023. That fear has only heightened this week with the attack in Boulder, the third violent attack on the Jewish community in the last two months.
Two Israeli embassy workers in Washington, DC, were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in late May, and an arsonist set the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion on fire on the first night of Passover because of Gov. Josh Shapiro’s views on the war in Gaza, according to search warrants.
“I wish I could say I was surprised by these events, but Jews have been sounding the alarm on the rise in antisemitism since October 7,” Sheila Katz, the CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women said. “This is what happens when we allow antisemitism to go unchecked.”
The attack on Sunday came during a peaceful demonstration aimed at raising awareness of the remaining hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured, and two remain hospitalized, officials said.
The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, told investigators he “wanted to kill all Zionist people” and had planned the attack for a year, according to an affidavit. He was captured on video by bystanders yelling “Free Palestine” before police arrested him.
Soliman now faces a federal hate crime charge and state charges of attempted murder.
“Most Jews right now are feeling unsafe and unsure about where to show up,” Katz said. “Killing and burning Jews does nothing to make Palestinians safer or more free.”
“Antisemitism will never be a path to justice.”
When the worst feels inenvitable
Sunday’s attack came hours before the start of Shavuot, the holiday commemorating the day God gave the Torah to the Jewish people.
At the Main Line Reform Temple just outside of Philadelphia, Senior Rabbi Geri Newburge said the past several weeks have been brutal, leaving her “pretty demoralized and heartbroken.”
The aftermath of October 7—combined with escalating protests against Israel’s war in Gaza— made an attack like this feel inevitable, she said.
“It doesn’t feel like such a stretch to me at this point that the rhetoric would move from posters or chants to doing something violent,” Newburge said.
The rabbi noted she and members of her congregation have also felt antisemitism increasing across the country — and it’s taking a toll.
“It’s exhausting — spiritually, emotionally and even physically,” Newburge explained.
Across the country, Jewish schools, synagogues and community centers continue to have tight security. Oftentimes, there is a visible police presence or armed security guards.
Michael Bernstein, board chair of the Tree of Life in Pittsburgh, attended an event last Wednesday for a local Jewish organization where some of the attendees were non-Jews. He called the necessary security an “unfortunate tax” and a measure most other communities don’t need.
This latest wave of attacks has left many Jewish leaders wondering what more can be done. Bernstein said Jews needed to secure their spaces, but security and the Jewish community alone wouldn’t solve antisemitism.
“This is an American problem, it’s not a Jewish problem,” he said, and pointed to Pittsburgh community after the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue.
The 2018 shooting, the worst attack on Jews in American history, left 11 worshippers dead and six others wounded.
Pittsburgh, he said, came together to say antisemitism wasn’t acceptable.
“An attack on one group is an attack on all of us,” Bernstein said. “And the community held us.”
“It’s an all-of-society approach.”
Non-violence is ‘non-negotiable’
Outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, candles and flowers mark the spot where Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were gunned down on May 21.
The white lilies placed at the memorial hadn’t even started wilting yet when the firebombing in Boulder began.
Milgrim and Lischinsky attended an event to discuss how multi-faith organizations could work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions like Gaza. Their friends and colleagues said they were devoted to the peace process in Israel.
The suspected gunman, whom DC police later identified as 31-year-old Chicago native Elias Rodriguez, shouted “Free Palestine” after he was arrested.
Katz, who said she knew Milgrim professionally and had been invited to the event, but was unable to attend, stressed “non-violence must be non-negotiable.”
“Anyone who wants to see peace, who wants to see an end to the war, who wants to see the hostages to be released, who wants to see a better future for Palestinians and Israelis, has to understand that violence towards Jews in America or around the world is not going to make that peace happen,” Katz said.
Antisemitism has surged globally, according to the Anti-Defamation League, and rose after the start of the war in Gaza. Threats to Jews in the United States tripled between October 7, 2023 and September 2024, the organization said.
Gay Keao said she has been critical of Israel’s action toward Palestinians but has also witnessed a disregard for Jewish safety since October 7. Now, she often wakes up wondering, “What’s going to happen next?”
“I just refuse to believe that the cyclical violence is inevitable,” she said. “As a Jewish person, I can’t embrace that. I’m here for breaking those cycles.”
‘It comes after everybody’
Nearly 2,000 miles away, sitting beneath his synagogue’s serene outdoor Holocaust memorial, Philadelphia Rabbi Shawn Zevit said his diverse urban congregation has been experiencing a mix of emotions.
But, he said, reaching out to Jewish loved ones is critical at this moment, so his community does not feel alone.
“Just the message of ‘I’m thinking about you,’” Zevit argued, can be comforting to Jewish people feeling upset.
But the rabbi also noted calling out even minor instances of antisemitism is key to preventing future attacks.
“Treat those moments as gateways for increased solidarity and vigilance,” he said.
Katz said people knew how to call out antisemitism when it was “bullets in synagogues or Nazis with tiki torches” but needed to be able to recognize it in all of its forms.
“Antisemitism doesn’t begin with bullets or firebombs,” she added. “But it ends there when it’s ignored.”
Bernstein, the chair of the board of the Tree of Life, warned antisemitism doesn’t stay a Jewish issue. He pointed to a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed in a racially motivated mass shooting at a supermarket.
“This hateful ideology,” he said, “it comes after everybody.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/01/middleeast/palestinians-killed-gaza-aid-center-intl-hnk,"Dozens shot dead and injured near Gaza aid hub, health ministry and doctors say",2025-06-01 06:50:49,"Dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by the Israeli military near an aid distribution site in Gaza on Sunday according to Palestinian officials and eyewitnesses, with Israel’s military denying that its troops fired “within or near” the aid site.
The Palestinian health ministry, hospital officials and a half-dozen eyewitnesses said the Israeli military was responsible for the gunfire. Palestinian officials said 31 Palestinians had been killed. The Israeli military said its forces “did not fire at civilians while they were near or within” the aid site, but an Israeli military source acknowledged that Israeli forces fired toward individuals about 1 kilometer (1093 yards) away, before the aid site opened.
The incident is the latest in which Palestinians have been killed while attempting to receive aid from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a controversial US-backed mechanism to distribute aid to the embattled and hungry enclave after a months-long Israeli blockade.
The GHF has been criticized by the United Nations and others, who warn it risks further displacing Palestinians and endangering civilians and last week. Previous distributions of aid at its sites have been marred by chaos and violence.
Multiple eyewitnesses told CNN they were fired upon at what is known as the “Al-Alam” roundabout approximately 800 meters (874 yards) from the site run by the GHF in southern Gaza.
The health ministry said that more than 200 casualties had reached hospitals, including dozens with serious injuries. It added that all those killed had been shot in the head or chest. The International Committee of the Red Cross said that it received “an influx of 179 cases, including women and children” at its nearby field hospital, including 21 who were declared dead upon arrival. Other dead and wounded were taken to Nasser Hospital.
“This is the highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago,” the Red Cross said in a statement.
Thousands of Palestinians were headed toward the aid distribution site in Rafah in the pre-dawn hours of Sunday, hoping to be among the first in line to obtain aid ahead of the site’s opening, a paramedic from the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), the only medical professionals present in the area at the time, told CNN.
One medical official told CNN that it was impossible to identify who was shooting “but those areas of the distribution are all under Israeli army responsibility in regards to security. Whether they shoot or others who are working for them, it is still their responsibility.”
CNN cannot independently verify who was responsible for the shooting. Israel prevents international media from entering Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said allegations that Israeli soldiers fired on Gazans near or within the aid distribution site were “false reports.” It added: “Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false.”
An Israeli military source said IDF forces did fire warning shots towards suspects approaching their position approximately a kilometer (1,100 yards) away from the aid distribution site in an incident that happened several hours before the site opened.
In a post on X, Philippe Lazzarini – executive director of UNRWA, the main United Nations agency in the Palestinian territories – said “aid distribution has become a death trap. Mass casualties including scores of injured & killed among starving civilians due to gunshots this morning. This is according to reports from international medics on ground.”
Dr. Ahmed Abu Sweid, an Australian working at the Nasser medical complex, said the victims brought in from the area of the aid hub had gunshot and shrapnel wounds. Some had gunshot wounds to the head and thorax, he said.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which runs the site, insisted: “There was no gunfire in the (distribution) center and also not in the surrounding area.”
“All aid was distributed today without incident. We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.”
Later Sunday, the foundation released surveillance video showing hundreds of people running towards the distribution point at dawn. One 4-minute video, which was without sound, showed no violence or injuries but there were what appeared to be two bursts of tracer fire nearby. Other GHF videos released later showed hundreds of people carrying away boxes of food.
Witnesses told CNN of chaotic scenes as people were trampled amid what they said was random gunfire. One man said: “It’s not a humanitarian point — it’s a death trap.”
CNN video showed thousands of people streaming away from the site. Some were carrying plastic bags and empty cardboard boxes, but none appeared to have received any aid.
One man, Ghassan Eid Al-Aghan, told CNN: “We couldn’t even reach the place where the aid was being handed out.”
“The situation there is terrifying. Heavy gunfire. I won’t risk my life to go. Things can’t go on like this,” he added.
Mohammad Qdeih said people had been told the gates would open at 5:30 a.m. local time, but then there was intense gunfire.
“The amount of aid the Americans bring is tiny,” Qdieh said. “Whoever manages to push forward might get something. Those who can’t get nothing.”
“They’re sniping everyone — women, children, innocent civilians who have nothing to do with anything,” Qdieh said.
Basel Abu Alwan said he had arrived at the site on Saturday night. Instructions had been given via a drone telling people to come back at 6 a.m., he said. “No distribution happens. People move forward and fall. Gunfire is sprayed randomly at everyone,” he said.
“Whoever can grab something does. If not, they may get trampled,” he added.
Many of the civilians told CNN that they had left wherever they were staying around midnight to make the long trek to the distribution site – but most left empty-handed.
Abdul Majid Al-Zayti said that he had walked for seven hours to reach the site. “Many people didn’t get anything. The large crowds that came from Gaza City and other areas got nothing,” he said.
“I couldn’t get any aid. I’m an old man. I have hungry children. No-one in this world wants to help them.”
One man who declined to give his name said that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation “place four or five wooden boards with aid on them and open the gates for people to storm and fight over it.”
Near the same Al-Alam junction on Monday morning, three Palestinians were shot dead and dozens wounded as they made their way to the aid distribution point, according to the Ministry of Health, which said Israeli forces opened fire as they approached the location. The IDF said that Israeli forces fired warning shots “towards several suspects who advanced toward the troops” in Rafah.
The GHF was set up amid Israeli accusations that Hamas is stealing aid in Gaza and profiting from sales, though Israel hasn’t presented any evidence publicly.
UN aid groups, such as UNRWA, typically check identification and rely on a database of registered families when distributing aid.
But the GHF is not screening Palestinians at aid distribution sites, despite Israeli officials saying that additional security measures were a core reason for the creation of the new program.
United Nations aid agencies have criticized the GHF’s aid mechanism, saying it violates humanitarian principles and raises the risks for Palestinians.
Criticism has been mounting against both Israel and the GHF after chaos broke out last week when tens of thousands of starving Palestinians arrived at two new food distribution sites.
According to Palestinian Ministry of Health figures, 11 people had been killed and dozens injured since the aid distribution sites opened last week – before Sunday’s casualties.
In a statement issued Sunday, the GHF said it would “continue scaling, with plans to build additional sites across Gaza, including in the northern region, in the weeks ahead.”
The statement added that it had provided more than 4.7 million meals in six days, including delivering 16 truckloads of food on Sunday morning, providing over 887,000 meals.
The interim executive director of GHF, John Acree, acknowledged Sunday that “the flow of humanitarian relief into Gaza remains far below what’s needed. The demand is overwhelming — and growing by the day.”
He added that GHF was “currently the only organization able to deliver food in a secure manner, but we are still operating under immense constraints and at the mercy of factors beyond our control.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/middleeast/saudi-foreign-minister-to-travel-to-west-bank-in-rare-move-intl,"Israel will block rare Saudi-led ministerial delegation from visiting West Bank, official says, as anger over Gaza grows",2025-05-14 00:00:00,"Israel has said it will “not cooperate” with plans from the Palestinian Authority (PA) to host a Saudi-led delegation of foreign ministers in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, an Israeli official told CNN on Friday.
In order to travel to the meeting in Ramallah, ministers from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and Turkey needed approval from Israel who controls access to the West Bank. It would have been the highest-level Saudi visit to the area since it was occupied by Israel in 1967.
The Israeli official dubbed the meeting “provocative” and told CNN “Israel will not cooperate with such moves aimed at harming it and its security.”
The official added that the PA “must stop violating its agreements with Israel on all levels.” It is unclear which agreements they are referring to.
On Saturday, a Saudi source with knowledge of the matter told CNN that Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan had postponed his planned trip to the West Bank – the first ever by such a high-ranking Saudi official since 1967 when Israel occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Hussein Al-Sheikh, vice president of the PA, had told CNN on Friday that an Arab ministerial delegation led by Prince Faisal planned to arrive in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Sunday to meet PA President Mahmoud Abbas.
The visit would have come as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman pushes for international recognition of Palestinian statehood as the war in Gaza drags on and as prospects of Saudi-Israeli normalization grow more distant.
Palestinian ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mazen Ghoneim had told Saudi state-run Al Ekhbariya that the Saudi foreign minister would be joined by the top diplomats from Egypt, Jordan and “other countries.”
“The ministerial visit… is considered a clear message. The Palestinian cause is a central issue to Arabs and Muslims,” Ghoneim said.
An Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israeli authorities were notified of the visit.
CNN has reached out to the governments of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE and Qatar for comment.
Shaul Arieli, the head of T-Politography, a think tank which studies the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said it would be the first such high-level delegation to visit the occupied West Bank since Israel seized the territory in 1967.
He told CNN the visit would be “unprecedented” and underscores a rise in Saudi support for the Palestinian Authority that emerged after the start of the war in Gaza.
“It’s a dramatic change,” Arieli said. The Saudis have made clear since the conflict began that “they support the two-state solution according to ’67 borders, they support the establishment of the capital of a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, and they are ready tosupport the budget of the Palestinian Authority.”
CNN understands that Saudi Arabia is frustrated at Israel’s refusal to end the war in Gaza and is exerting intense diplomatic efforts to convince Western states to recognize Palestinian statehood, including the United States. The kingdom is confident that France will be among the states that will do so in June. Riyadh is also working to prop up the Palestinian Authority as it sees no viable alternative to its role as the political representative of the Palestinian people.
In his initial term, US President Donald Trump brokered landmark normalization deals between Israel and multiple Arab states. Yet, his primary ambition remains securing an agreement between Saudi Arabia, a key Muslim power, and Israel.
Normalization talks between the kingdom and Israel were progressing before Hamas’ October 7 attack. Saudi Arabia was to establish diplomatic relations with Israel and in exchange receive a lucrative defense treaty with Washington, including the possibility of a nuclear program in the kingdom.
But as the death toll in Gaza rose and anger spread across the Arab and Muslim world, Saudi Arabia told US officials that it would not normalize relations unless Israel agreed to a pathway for a Palestinian state and “calm in Gaza.”
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman doubled down in his criticism of Israel, accusing it of committing genocide in Gaza — a claim Israel has denied. His top diplomat told CNN last year that recognition of Israel would not happen without a Palestinian state.
In June, Saudi Arabia is expected to co-chair with France a high-level conference in New York for a two-state solution, which envisions the creation of a Palestinian state beside Israel.
Speaking in Singapore on Friday, Macron said the eventual recognition of a Palestinian state, was “not only a moral duty, but a political necessity.”
“What we are building over the coming weeks is obviously a political response to the crisis (in Gaza). And yes, it’s a necessity. Because today, over and above the current humanitarian tragedy, it is the very possibility of a Palestinian state that is being questioned.” he said.
He warned that Israel has “hours or days” to improve humanitarian situation in Gaza or face “tougher” European stance.
Riyadh appointed a non-resident ambassador to the Palestinian territories in 2023, weeks before Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel that left 1,200 people dead and triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. The ambassador, Nayef Al Sudairi visited the West Bank in September 2023 to present his credentials to Abbas in what was the highest-level official Saudi visit in decades at the time.
Historically, two Saudi kings have visited Jerusalem, including King Saud in 1954, and King Faisal in 1966.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip-occupation-resources-dg,Israel’s plan to ‘conquer’ Gaza is leaving Palestinians with little place to go: 5 maps show how,2025-05-30 00:00:00,"Even before Israel’s war in Gaza started, the territory was one of the most densely populated places on the planet, described by United Nations officials as an “open-air prison.” Now, Israeli forces are expanding their operations, cramming the population into an ever-shrinking patch of land.
Israel’s latest military offensive, named “Gideon’s Chariots,” aims to finally “conquer” the territory, as one government minister put it. Almost 80% of the enclave has come under evacuation orders or been designated as a militarized zone since March 18 when Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas, according to the UN. Since then, Israel has a declared policy – backed by the US – to encourage resettlement of Gaza’s residents.
As part of the “intensified operation,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the whole population of Gaza – around 2 million people – will be displaced to the south of the 140 square-mile territory.
The Israeli military claims the operation is aimed at destroying Hamas and freeing hostages. Meanwhile, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the operation could lead to a complete takeover of the territory.
“We are finally going to conquer the Gaza Strip,” he said after Israel’s security cabinet approved the expanded campaign.
See what Israel’s expanding operation means on the ground, in five maps.
Around 80% of Gaza is covered by evacuation orders and Israeli-militarized zones
Some Gazans in the north say they have fled to the nearby coastline in a last-ditch effort to escape the renewed bombardment, exhausted by Israel’s 19-month assault. Others are sleeping in tents surrounded by the rubble of their former homes, fearful to leave in case they are forced out of Gaza.
Since Israel broke the ceasefire in mid-March, at least 2-3 kilometers (1.2-1.9 miles) into Gaza’s land border is a no-go zone, which includes a 1 kilometer-wide (around 0.6 miles) buffer area next to Israeli territory where homes, factories and farmland have been systematically levelled.
Access to the Mediterranean Sea to fish is all but banned. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), most fishing boats have been destroyed and Palestinians fishing meters from the shore have been targeted.
Another militarized corridor was established in early April — the Israeli-demarcated “Morag Corridor” in Rafah — with the stated intention of “dividing the strip.” This is one of at least four routes established to control Gaza by the Israeli military who demolish and clear all buildings and cropland to make way for them.
At least 31 evacuation orders have been issued by Israeli forces since March 18 this year covering large areas of the strip, sometimes at the rate of two a day. As a result, an estimated 600,000 people in Gaza have been displaced in that time (this figure includes people who may have been displaced multiple times), according to the United Nations-led Site Management Cluster.
Evacuation orders aren’t necessarily permanent, but Israel has not stated how long they are active. CNN has asked the Israeli military if the orders expire and how that information is shared with people in Gaza but has not received a reply.
In northern Gaza, these orders have recently been accompanied by instructions to move south, despite ongoing attacks there too. This week, the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for most of southern Gaza with directives to head toward the Al-Mawasi area, ahead of what its spokesperson said would be an “unprecedented attack.”
Aid groups have criticized the use of these directives, branding them as confusing, often inaccurate and overly reliant on an internet connection which most people in Gaza only have intermittent access to. The delivery mechanism is varied, with some receiving text messages or phone calls ahead of an attack, while for others the first sign is incoming Israeli fire. On the ground, Gaza no longer looks familiar to residents, with most landmarks destroyed or damaged, including shops, trees and roads, making it much more difficult to navigate. In order to move around, people need to pass through heavily militarized checkpoints, usually on foot.
“There’s no place for my children and me to sleep, and I don’t know what to do,” Iman Al Agha, a mother of six who said she was forced out of the northern city of Beit Lahia when Israeli quadcopters started shooting at her and her family, told CNN last week.
“I’ve been on the street with my children for three days, and I can’t find a place to settle,” she said. “I wish for death at any moment. I don’t know what to do with my children or where this life will take us. There is no solution.”
Since Israel launched its war in Gaza following Hamas’ deadly October 2023 attacks, Gazans have been displaced an average of six times – some up to 19 times – according to the Danish Refugee Council.
For many, repeated displacement means reliving the trauma of generations uprooted by what Palestinians call al-Nakba, or “the catastrophe,” when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in historic Palestine, during the creation of Israel in 1948.
Outside of the no-go zones, most of what’s left is rubble
Most of the remaining areas that are not under evacuation orders or militarized are heavily damaged. A assessment by the CUNY Graduate Center found 60% of buildings are destroyed while the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said 92% of homes have either been damaged or destroyed. According to the UN Satellite Centre, 68% of roads are also damaged, which adds to the complications of transporting aid around the strip.
Of the agricultural land, a report published in the Journal of Science of Remote Sensing found around 80% of tree crops — such as olives and fruit trees — are likely damaged, as well as 65% of greenhouses used to grow food such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and strawberries. The FAO has also reported that all cropland in Rafah, and nearly all cropland in the northern governorates are not accessible.
Al-Mawasi, where many people have been instructed to go by the Israeli military, is a narrow coastal strip in southern Gaza. Once rural farmland, by February it was the most populated area in Gaza with an estimated 116,000 people, almost 6% of the enclave’s population, displaced there, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Sufficient shelter is now incredibly scarce in Gaza. Omar Alsaqqa, a Gaza resident who works for aid group Médecins Sans Frontières in Khan Younis, said in a statement provided to CNN that there are no tents left and no space for people to set up.
“I don’t know what to answer when colleagues ask me where they can go with their children in the middle of the night. We are running out of options to stay alive,” he said.
Nada Siyam, a displaced woman who gave birth in her tent in Gaza City last week, told CNN that there isn’t even a bed for her newborn, Eid, to sleep on. “My child is two days old and is suffering from the heat. There are many mosquitoes and rats all around us. We live in the streets amidst all this filth,” she said.
Further south, aid workers say they are overstretched, burnt out and fearful that they won’t be able to provide adequate care for a potential influx of more uprooted people.
Do people have access to the basics – food, medical care and water – in the south of the strip?
Food is scarce
Beginning on March 2, an 11-week blockade stopped all humanitarian aid from entering the strip. In the past week, some aid has entered through the southern Kerem Shalom crossing, but humanitarian agencies say food has yet to reach the over half a million people currently facing starvation across Gaza. “It remains far from enough to meet the soaring humanitarian needs,” UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said.
Medical services are overwhelmed
Medical facilities are already experiencing critical shortages of “almost all essential materials, from basic consumables to infection prevention and control, to life-saving medications,” Summer Al Jamal, who works at Nasser Hospital on the outskirts of Khan Younis for UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, told CNN last week.
“If military operations continue, the existing health facilities will simply not be able to cope with the numbers of displaced people,” Al Jamal said.
They are also facing an “overwhelming number of cases that require urgent, specialized medical care. Care that we can no longer provide,” Al Jamal added, while recalling how a 10-year-old boy who recently suffered head trauma in an airstrike that killed his family could not be treated as the medication he needed is no longer available in Gaza.
“If the situation remains unchanged, we do not expect to receive any medical supplies in the near future,” she said.
Water supply is facing shutdown
As well as medical aid, experts say Israel’s displacement plans will necessitate the significant restructuring of Gaza’s water supply system, much of which has already been destroyed or damaged since the war began.
“By forcing the population to move around… will further complicate access to water because new water points will have to be set up, new routes, new water trucking,” Wim Zwijnenburg, who analyses the environmental impact of conflicts for the Dutch peace organization PAX, told CNN.
In southern Gaza, the 140,000 litres of fuel needed weekly to maintain water supply operations was not received last week, leading to warnings from local officials of an imminent full-scale shutdown, the UN reported on May 21.
“The situation is especially dire in Al-Mawasi, which is not connected to the water network,” the UN said, adding that the area depends entirely on water being delivered via trucks.
There are hundreds of truckloads worth of water, sanitation and hygiene supplies stuck outside of the strip ready to cross the border “at any moment once allowed in,” UNICEF told CNN on Thursday.
International backlash
Israel’s displacement plans have received international backlash in recent weeks, with the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, and Canada threatening to take “concrete actions,” including sanctions, if Israel does not stop its latest military operations and continues to block aid from entering Gaza.
Netanyahu has vowed to push forward with the fresh offensive: “At the end of the operation all areas of the strip will be under Israeli security control,” he said last Wednesday.
Meanwhile, despite everything, some Gazans plan to resist Israel’s latest directives.
“This is our land, and we will not leave it. We will resist, and we live on our land,” Abdul Naser Siyam, who shares a makeshift tent with 22 other people in northern Gaza, told CNN. “Just imagine how it would be if we left and went to the land of others.”","['Billy Stockwell', 'Sarah-Grace Mankarious', 'Lou Robinson', 'Abeer Salman', 'Tareq Al Hilou']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/29/world/israel-us-proposal-ceasefire-hamas-latam-intl,"Israel accepts new US proposal for ceasefire with Hamas, says Israeli official",2025-05-29 17:35:43,"Israel has accepted the new proposal for a ceasefire with Hamas from US envoy Steve Witkoff, according to an Israeli official.
The proposal, viewed by CNN, includes Hamas releasing 10 Israeli hostages and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for 125 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,111 Gazans detained since the war began. Negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire would begin immediately on the first day of the 60-day truce, according to the proposal.
Meanwhile, Hamas said the latest framework comes from Israel and “does not respond to any of our people’s demands, foremost among which is stopping the war and famine,” according to Bassem Naim, a member of the militant group’s political bureau.
“Nevertheless, the movement’s leadership is studying, with all national responsibility, a response to the proposal, in light of the genocide to which our people are being subjected,” he added on Facebook.
According to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the hostage families earlier in the day that he had accepted Witkoff’s proposal.
During her briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that “special envoy Witkoff and the President submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported” and that discussions are ongoing.
“We hope that a cease fire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home and that’s been a priority for this administration from the beginning,” Leavitt added.
Proposed terms for a ceasefire
Under the proposed framework, half of the hostages and half of the prisoners will be released on the first day of the 60-day ceasefire agreement; the other half will be released on the seventh day.
If Israel and Hamas fail to reach an agreement for a permanent ceasefire by the end of the 60-day period, the pause in fighting “may be extended under conditions and for a duration to be agreed upon by the parties so long as the parties are negotiating in good faith,” the proposal says.
But the agreement contains no intrinsic guarantee of a permanent end to the war, a key Hamas demand, nor assurances that the ceasefire will be extended as long as negotiations continue. Instead, the proposal says that US President Donald Trump is “committed to working to ensure that good faith negotiations continue until a final agreement is reached.”
Humanitarian aid, which has only begun to trickle into Gaza after an 11-week Israeli blockade on food, medicine and more, would enter Gaza “immediately” at the start of the ceasefire. It will be distributed “through agreed upon channels,” including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The proposal makes no mention of the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid mechanism.
The proposal does say the aid will begin flowing “once Hamas agrees to the ceasefire agreement,” an indication that the plan was coordinated with the Israelis. On Thursday, Leavitt said that “Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas.”
The US, Egypt, and Qatar would guarantee the ceasefire agreement, according to the proposal.
The proposal appears to stipulate that Trump would take credit for a deal. “President Trump will personally announce the ceasefire agreement,” it says.
Hamas has responded to Witkoff’s latest proposal with three counterpoints, according to a senior Hamas official.
The official told CNN Hamas would agree to the release of the hostages and a 60-day ceasefire, as outlined in the US proposal, but they want US assurances that negotiations over a permanent ceasefire will continue and the fighting will not resume after the 60 days.
Hamas wants the humanitarian assistance to be carried out through the United Nations channels. And lastly, they want the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to pull back to the positions that they held on March 2 this year, before Israel re-launched its military operations
Another person familiar with the Hamas counterproposal confirmed the three points.
‘We want to stop this’
The senior Hamas official told CNN that they responded to Witkoff’s proposal via Palestinian-American interlocutor Bishara Bahbah, who has been in direct discussions with Hamas negotiators in Doha.
The Hamas official said that two days ago, they discussed the Hamas terms with Bahbah, which were sent to Witkoff. Then, the official said, after Witkoff met with Israeli official Ron Dermer in Washington this week, “everything changed 100%.”
“We were shocked because we were told 2-3 times from Bishara [Bahbah] he approved the framework and had no problem,” said the senior Hamas official, calling the latest Witkoff proposal an “Israeli paper.”
“We are ready to return all the hostages in one day, just we want a guarantee that war will not come again after that,” the official said. “Now in this paper we didn’t find it,” the Hamas official said. “They want to continue the war, we want to stop this,” he added.
Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, wrote on Facebook that a proposal had been agreed upon with Witkoff last week and that the latest framework comes from Israel and it “means perpetuating the occupation and continuing the killing and famine.”
After this latest proposal, Hamas is ready to release half of the remaining 20 living hostages, which the first Hamas official called a “big risk” because there’s no guarantee Israel will respect the agreement.
“We know that Witkoff is a strong man he can do something. He’s the only one who can impact Israel,” the official said
The same official said the Trump administration reneged on terms following the release of Israeli-American Edan Alexander, including a thanks to Hamas from President Trump and humanitarian aid that didn’t immediately start flowing back into Gaza.
“Hamas is very, very interested to reach an agreement to end the war and return the hostages,” said the official.
Earlier on Thursday, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalal Smotrich said accepting the proposal would be “sheer madness,” writing on social media that he “will not allow such a thing to happen. Period.”
But Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the proposal “publicly and immediately.” He said he would support the government, even if its far-right members abandoned it.
On Friday, UN Secretary General spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said that the UN hopes the negotiation process will be successful.
“We very much hope that the work of the mediators will be successful, so we can put an end to this cycle of suffering, cycle of violence we’re all witnessing. Hopefully, put Israelis and Palestinians back on a positive track on the peace process,” Dujarric said.","['Dana Karni', 'Alex Marquardt', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Jeremy Diamond', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/middleeast/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-screenings-hamas-intl,Gaza Humanitarian Foundation isn’t screening recipients - despite being established to keep supplies from Hamas,2025-05-30 15:44:30,"The embattled Israeli-backed aid group that began operating in Gaza earlier this week is not screening Palestinians at aid distribution sites, despite Israeli officials saying that additional security measures were a core reason for the creation of the new program.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is operating in the strip with US and Israeli approval, was established amid Israeli accusations that Hamas is stealing aid in Gaza and profiting off its sale. Humanitarian organizations have said there is no evidence tying significant diversion of aid to Hamas, and Israel has presented none publicly. But it is those claims that have prompted Israel to seek to replace traditional humanitarian organizations with GHF, which they said would prevent Hamas from obtaining the aid.
Yet GHF appears to have fewer safeguards in place to ensure aid reaches those in need than United Nations aid organizations, like UNRWA, which typically does check identification and relies on a database of registered families when distributing aid.
A journalist working with CNN who entered one distribution site and multiple Palestinians who collected aid at several sites said they faced no security or identification screenings before entering. Several eyewitnesses said criminal gangs and merchants were taking advantage of the situation, paying people to make trips into the distribution sites to collect aid boxes they could then resell.
CNN video filmed outside the aid site shows several groups of young men hauling away aid boxes on donkey carts, while hiding their faces with their shirts and asking not to be filmed.
“There is not enough aid distributed in Gaza yet … so our focus is on feeding hungry people, not checking IDs,” a GHF spokesperson told CNN. “We have no knowledge nor have witnessed any criminal behavior.”
When asked if GHF would check identification in the future, the spokesperson called the situation “fluid” and said GHF would continuously “reassess the situation.”
GHF’s operations do include more militarized security around their distribution sites and truck convoys entering Gaza. Armed American security contractors have secured GHF aid trucks entering Gaza, reducing the risk of those trucks being seized or looted while en route.
The lack of screenings raises questions about how GHF will be more effective at preventing the diversion of aid than the UN agencies which have supplied the overwhelming majority of aid to Gaza during the war and which have refused to participate in the new GHF-run mechanism due to concerns about a lack of independence and heightened risks for Palestinians.
GHF said in a recent statement that it would establish a “secure, transparent system to deliver aid directly and effectively – without diversion or delay.”
But Palestinians at the site said diversion of aid is already underway.
“The Americans opened the doors for us and whoever wants can get in and take what they need,” Bilal Hawadri said, referring to American security contractors. “Some stood in the line, but then people started stealing.”
Another man, Yousef Shallouf, said he saw “gangsters” pay individuals to “go get aid boxes,” which they would then resell.
Such actions would be more difficult under the UN-administered systems. During much of the war, UNRWA – the primary provider of aid in Gaza – has distributed aid based on its database of families in Gaza.
Recipients are asked to bring identification and once a family representative has collected aid, they are ticked off a list, according to an UNRWA spokesperson.
Israeli officials have recently forced the UN to alter that system, requiring recent distributions to take place at bakeries and kitchens where mass distribution, rather than a per-household system, takes place.
The UN’s aid agencies have refused to participate in the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s aid mechanism, saying it violates humanitarian principles and raises the risks for Palestinians. UN officials have only ramped up their criticism this week, amid chaotic scenes near the distribution points and killings near the sites.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health has said that 11 Palestinians were killed this week near the GHF distribution points, amid Israeli gunfire directed at crowds of people near the sites.
Earlier in the week, thousands of hungry Palestinians overran one of the distribution points, prompting American security contractors to withdraw from the site.
GHF says it has distributed more than 23,000 boxes of food aid this week, totaling more than 2 million meals.
“Despite the emergency intensity and kinetic environment surrounding our operations, the fact is our assistance efforts are helping Gazans,” GHF’s interim executive director John Acree said in a statement Friday. “But this is just the beginning. Our commitment to safely and effectively supplying food directly to a large, hungry population is unwavering, and we look forward to continuing to scale and strengthen on our initial undertakings to help meet the basic food security needs of the people in Gaza.”","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Mohammad Al-Sawalhi', 'Abeer Salman']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/29/middleeast/israel-condemnation-gaza-aid-distribution-intl,Israel faces growing condemnation as Gaza aid distribution devolves into chaos,2025-05-29 00:00:00,"Israel is facing growing international pressure as aid distribution efforts in Gaza devolved into chaos during the first days of a controversial new mechanism backed by the United States and Israel.
According to the Palestinian health ministry, 11 people have been killed and dozens injured as crowds of desperate people arrived at distribution sites in southern Gaza since they opened earlier this week.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which runs the new sites, said on Thursday that no one was killed or injured during the distribution of aid.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians, pushed towards famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade, descended on both the sites belonging to the GHF, as well as a warehouse run by the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) over the past three days, grabbing bags of food and bags of flour. Food scarcity in Gaza has sparked scenes of desperation and widespread looting in recent days.
The start of the new aid mechanism comes as some of Israel’s closest allies have grown increasingly vocal in their condemnation of its conduct in Gaza, and their threats of action should the bombardment and restrictions on aid continue.
On Wednesday, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said, “Israel’s strikes in Gaza go beyond what is necessary to fight Hamas.” She also criticized the new aid mechanism run by GHF, saying the EU does not support “any kind of privatization of the distribution of humanitarian aid.”
Recent comments by officials from Germany, one of Israel’s staunchest defenders in Europe, have also put support for Israel under the spotlight. “The Israeli government must not do anything that its best friends are no longer prepared to accept,” Chancellor Friedrich Merz said this week.
Last week, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, and Canada threatened to take “concrete action,” including targeted sanctions, if Israel does not stop its renewed military offensive and continues to block aid from entering Gaza.
The Israeli military issued a massive evacuation order blanketing much of northern and eastern Gaza late Thursday, with a new directive for residents in five major areas. This order, combined with another forced evacuation from most of southern Gaza issued earlier this week, appear to be designed to displace Palestinians into a shrinking band of land along the coast. Although the exact number of people required to evacuate is uncertain, this development is likely to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the enclave. The Israeli strategy, set out by Defense Minister Israel Katz last month, is to empty large parts of Gaza and treat anyone staying behind as a combatant.
But even as Israel’s allies issue warnings, the desperation of starving Palestinians persists – while the GHF presses on with its push to become the enclave’s primary aid provider.
On Tuesday, a massive throng of Palestinians overran the first GHF aid site in southern Gaza, tearing down some of the fencing and climbing over crowd control barriers. The rush forced the private contractors manning the site in Tel al-Sultan to “fall back to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely,” GHF said, even as videos from the scene showed masses of people grabbing boxes of aid and leaving.
GHF asserted that “there have been no deaths at any GHF location. Reports to the contrary originated from Hamas and are inaccurate.”
A day later, “hordes of hungry people” broke into a UN warehouse in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza, in search of food, according to the WFP. Sounds of gunfire were audible in videos from the scene. According to WFP, initial reports indicated that two people were killed and several were injured in the incident.
WFP said humanitarian needs had spiraled out of control after “80 days of complete blockade” by Israel, which was only been partially relieved in the past week.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Wednesday that the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “at its darkest point yet.” It criticized the new framework, saying that “a new militarized distribution system has just been launched” that “puts people at risk, and it will not meet people’s needs, or dignity, across Gaza.”
“The conditions for us to deliver aid safely and at scale are absent,” OCHA said in a statement.
For now, the new GHF mechanism and the established UN distribution are concurrently operating in Gaza. But little aid is coming into the territory, and some areas, especially in northern Gaza, appear to be receiving nothing.
The UN has explained that it has not been able to collect humanitarian aid from the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza for the past three days, according to UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.
During Thursday’s noon briefing, Dujarric stated that the organization is facing obstacles, including obtaining necessary clearances to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side. Out of 900 trucks, 600 have been offloaded on the Gaza side and “have not yet been distributed into Gaza itself,” Dujarric explained.
Geolocated video on Thursday also showed crowds looting a street market in Zeitoun, northern Gaza, an area where even less aid is arriving than in the south.
On Thursday, three of four GHF sites distributed boxes of food, including the first such site in central Gaza, as the organization tries to reach its stated goal of providing food for 1.2 million Palestinians by the end of the month, just days away. Yet GHF remained confident, saying “we are well on our way” to providing enough food – along with UN distribution – for the entire population of more than 2 million Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
UN officials have cast doubt on GHF’s projections.
Omar Abd Rabbo, a Gaza resident, went to the new site in the center of the enclave for food as it opened. In a series of videos, he said, “The place was filled with chaos and random jostling, a scene that reflects the extent of the suffering and hunger experienced by the people of Gaza.” He took a short video with one of the US security contractors manning the site and said, “Thank you.”
But many did not get the food for which they desperately waited. Video from the scene showed security inside the site throwing what appeared to be stun grenades at Palestinians waiting for food outside. GHF said “non-lethal means” were used, including “smoke and warning shots,” when the crowd would not disperse. Witnesses said people who didn’t get aid took the tables and chairs from the site.
Yousef Hammad, another resident, said a huge crowd numbering tens of thousands approached the newly opened site, but he told CNN that very few got boxes.
“This is a big lie, a trap and betrayal, and this is only for thieves and merchants… People do not benefit anything,” Hammad said. “There is no aid or any humanity. This is humiliating and insulting. This is lack of dignity for our people and children.”","['Mohammad Al Sawalhi', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Abeer Salman', 'Tim Lister', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/29/middleeast/israel-west-bank-settlements-expansion-intl,Israel approves biggest expansion of West Bank settlements in decades,2024-07-20 00:00:00,"Israel approved a massive expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank this week in a move described as a continuation of de facto annexation of the territory.
Peace Now, an Israeli non-governmental organization that tracks settlements, said it was the largest expansion of settlements since the signing of the Oslo Accords more than 30 years ago.
Israel will establish 22 new settlements, including deep within the West Bank and in areas from which the country had previously withdrawn, as part of the new security cabinet decision, according to a joint statement from Defense Minister Israel Katz and far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
“All the new communities are being established with a long-term strategic vision, aimed at reinforcing Israeli control of the territory, preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state, and securing development reserves for settlement in the coming decades,” the statement said.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for the president of the Palestinian Authority, called the announcement a “dangerous escalation and a challenge to international legitimacy and international law.”
In a statement issued earlier in the week after reports emerged of the settlement approval, Abu Rudeineh said the move would “perpetuate regional violence and instability.”
Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, as well as in East Jerusalem and the occupied Golan Heights, are considered illegal under international law.
For months, Israel’s military has carried out a massive operation in the West Bank, deploying tanks to the territory for the first time in decades and displacing tens of thousands of Palestinians.
In February, Katz ordered the military “to prepare for a prolonged presence” as the military evacuated Palestinian refugee camps. Within the last several weeks, Israeli forces have carried out multiple waves of raids and arrests across the West Bank.
He added the new settlements are “illegal under international law, further imperil the two-state solution, and do not protect Israel.”
The decision this week to expand settlements sparked international criticism. The United Kingdom’s minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Hamish Falconer, called the move a “deliberate obstacle to Palestinian statehood.”
Jordan’s foreign ministry also lambasted the move, saying in a statement that it “represents a deliberate disregard for ongoing international calls to halt settlement activity and violations in the occupied Palestinian territories.”
“All Israeli actions and decisions in the West Bank are illegal and illegitimate,” the statement added.
Earlier this month, France joined the UK and Canada to threaten “concrete actions,” including targeted sanctions against Israel, if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government did not allow far more aid into Gaza and cease settlement expansion in the West Bank.
Peace Now blasted the government for making such a decision in the midst of a war. “The government is making clear - again and without restraint - that it prefers deepening the occupation and advancing de facto annexation over pursuing peace,” the organization said.
“The Israeli government no longer pretends otherwise: the annexation of the Occupied Territories and expansion of settlements is its central goal.”
The Oslo Accords, signed in 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), were designed to pave the way for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the realization of a two-state solution.
Peace Now said 12 of the new settlements will be the legalization of illegal outposts. Outposts are illegally established by Jewish settlers without approval from the government with the intention to push for formal recognition and legalization. Another nine of the settlements will be entirely new, while the final one will be the conversion of an existing neighborhood to an independent settlement, according to Peace Now.
Two of the settlements in the new plan were evacuated during the disengagement from parts of the West Bank in 2005, which forbade Israelis from establishing a civilian presence in those areas. That law was overturned by the current right-wing Israeli government.
Smotrich gloated about the new settlements, making clear his goal was annexation. “The next step – sovereignty! We did not take a foreign land, but the inheritance of our ancestors,” he said in a statement.
Earlier this month, the security cabinet approved a land registration process for Area C of the West Bank, which is under Israeli civil and security control. Peace Now called the move “a mega theft of Palestinian lands.”","['Dana Karni', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/politics/iran-nuclear-talks-trump-israel,Trump says he believes US is close to reaching a new Iran nuclear deal as he confirms he told Israel not to disrupt the talks,2025-05-28 22:22:46,"President Donald Trump believes his administration is “very close to a solution” on an Iran nuclear agreement and he has personally warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to disrupt the talks, he said on Wednesday.
Trump cautioned his close ally last week that any move to upend the negotiations would be “inappropriate,” he told reporters.
Sources familiar with the discussions echoed Trump’s optimism and told CNN that they are closing in on a broad agreement that could be clinched when the US and Iran meet next, most likely in the Middle East.
But concerns about Israel derailing the process are clearly high. Asked about reports that he warned Netanyahu against disrupting the talks during a phone call last week, Trump said, “Well, I’d like to be honest. Yes I did.” He added: “It’s not a warning – I said I don’t think it’s appropriate.”
Trump said that his team is having “very good discussions” with Iran. Talks have taken place over the last several weeks led by special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and moderated by Oman.
“Right now, I think they want to make a deal. And if we can make a deal, I’d save a lot of lives,” Trump said.
Trump’s candid admission about the Netanyahu call follows CNN reporting last week that the US obtained new intelligence suggesting Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Netanyahu has long been a staunch opponent of any kind of deal with Tehran and he applauded Trump’s decision in his first term for the US to exit the nuclear agreement agreed to by President Barack Obama in 2015.
The stakes are enormously high – an Israeli strike could undo the progress the US has made, risk triggering a wider regional conflict and ruin Trump’s chances of achieving a major foreign policy breakthrough as progress on brokering ceasefires in the wars in Ukraine and Gaza has stalled.
Trump’s comments come after Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson expressed openness to compromises, telling CNN on Monday that there are “so many ways” an agreement on the future of its nuclear program could be reached.
Enrichment has a key focus of talks
Still, the issue of whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium remains the key sticking point. And Trump himself acknowledged Iran “still (has) to agree to the final stages of a document.”
The fifth round of talks, which took place in Rome on Friday, dealt more heavily with the question of enrichment.
“Everyone is feeling good,” a Trump administration official said following the talks in Rome. “We have a much better understanding of everyone’s positions.”
The Trump administration had demanded Iran stop all uranium enrichment, which Witkoff has said “enables weaponization” and called a red line in the talks. Uranium, a key nuclear fuel, can be used to build a nuclear bomb if enriched to high levels. Iran has advanced its nuclear program in recent years but also maintains that its program is peaceful. Iran says it is willing to commit not to enrich uranium to weapons-grade as part of an agreement but has said it would reject an outright ban on all enrichment.
Trump – who said that he wants a “very strong document” – seemed to indicate on Wednesday that the current talks have included discussions on increased inspections inside Iran and the dismantling of at least a part of Iran’s nuclear program.
“I want it very strong where we can go in with inspectors. We can take whatever we want, we can blow up whatever we want, but nobody getting killed. We can blow up a lab, but nobody’s going to be in the lab, as opposed to everybody being in the lab and blowing it up,” Trump said.
Trump administration officials, including Witkoff, have said publicly said that the US red line is any Iranian enrichment. But Trump’s comments on Wednesday indicated that he may be open to allowing limited enrichment with inspectors as a solution to the impasse.
Previously, US officials have also floated the idea of Iran importing enriched uranium, rather than doing so in the country – a notion that Iran has repeatedly rejected.
US could invest in Iran’s nuclear power program
The current discussion includes the US possibly investing in Iran’s nuclear power program and standing up a consortium – expected to include nations from the Middle East and the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency – that would produce enriched uranium for Iran’s reactors, explained one of the sources.
But nothing has been agreed to regarding Iran’s civilian nuclear energy program, a White House official said.
Iran’s ballistic missile program is not a part of the current discussion, despite some administration officials initially pressing for it to be included. Given how far the talks have advanced at this point sources did not expect an expansion of the topics under discussion. Witkoff in early May suggested that topics other than the nuclear file were “secondary” issues.
“We don’t want to confuse the nuclear discussion because that to us is the existential issue,” he told Breitbart at the time.
Following the Rome talks, the two sides brought the latest proposals to their countries’ respective leaders to confer and are planning to meet again soon, most likely in the Middle East.
The goal is to strike an overall deal at the next meeting between the two sides that lays out specific markers for implementation but also leads to follow-up discussions on technical details, White House officials and sources familiar with the ongoing discussions said.
Witkoff and Michael Anton, the director of policy planning at the State Department, have been taking the lead on all talks in addition to a technical team that has begun working out more specific details for an agreement. However, it is widely expected the technical team will take over and be far more involved once a broad agreement is struck.
Despite Trump touting the expectation of “good news” in the near future, progress in the negotiations has been bumpy at times.
In the fourth round of talks, the US shared a proposal with Iran outlining some of the key requirements the Trump administration is looking for in a deal. But at one point an idea under discussion, which the negotiators on both sides appeared to support, was rejected by Trump, said a source familiar with the matter.
And while Trump is projecting confidence that a deal is on the horizon, he also claimed on Wednesday that the situation “could change at any moment – could change with a phone call.”","['Kylie Atwood', 'Alayna Treene', 'Jennifer Hansler']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/middleeast/hamas-mohammed-sinwar-killed-netanyahu-intl,Mohammed Sinwar: Netanyahu says Israel killed elusive Hamas leader,2023-12-17 00:00:00,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that a recent airstrike killed Mohammed Sinwar, Hamas’ elusive de facto leader in Gaza, the latest in a string of assassinations that have dealt a serious blow to the group’s top brass but are yet to break its grip on power.
Sinwar is the brother of former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by the Israeli military in southern Gaza in October.
Netanyahu made the announcement during a speech in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, as the country marked 600 days since the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023.
CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment.
“We changed the face of the Middle East, we pushed the terrorists from our territories, we entered the Gaza Strip with force, we eliminated tens of thousands of terrorists, we eliminated (Mohammad) Deif, (Ismail) Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Sinwar,” he told lawmakers.
Netanyahu’s unilateral declaration, which was made without any supporting statements from the Israeli military or the defense minister, came as he faces ongoing nationwide protests around over his determination to continue the war in Gaza until the complete defeat of Hamas.
On the 600th day of the war, protesters called for a comprehensive deal to end the fighting and free the hostages, but Netanyahu remained adamant that he would pursue what he has called “complete victory.”
“We will defeat Hamas, dismantle its leadership, and demilitarize Gaza – that is what will happen,” he said in his Knesset speech, a goal which includes eliminating Hamas’ top leaders.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out a massive strike on the European Hospital in Khan Younis on May 13 — a day after Hamas released Israeli-American soldier Edan Alexander.
At the time, the IDF said it had struck “Hamas terrorists in a command-and-control center” in underground infrastructure at the hospital, and senior Israeli official and two sources familiar with the matter told CNN that the strike targeted Mohammed Sinwar. The strike killed several dozen people and wounded dozens more, the health ministry in Gaza said at the time.
Hamas had rejected claims about Sinwar’s death when the strike occurred, saying in a statement that only it is “authorized to confirm or deny what is published.”
Sinwar’s death would deprive Hamas of an able and determined commander. But many analysts say it won’t bring the end of the conflict any closer. It may even complicate negotiations with Israel if a new leader doesn’t emerge and Hamas mediators are left without a Hamas interlocutor inside Gaza.
Israeli officials considered Mohammed Sinwar just as hardline as his brother, Yahya, but much more experienced militarily. According to the IDF, he commanded the group’s Khan Younis Brigade until 2016.
Since the start of the war, he had remained largely hidden, along with many of Hamas’ senior leaders in Gaza. In December 2023, the IDF released video of what it said was Mohammed Sinwar driving through a tunnel in Gaza. In February 2024, the IDF said it had located his office in western Khan Younis.
Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Israel has destroyed Hamas’ military capacity and ability to govern. To that end, Israel has gone after Hamas’ top leaders in Gaza, and Sinwar is the latest target.
In July, the IDF killed the group’s military leader, Mohammed Deif, in a strike on an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. Two weeks later, Israel assassinated Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran. Then, in October, Israeli forces killed Yahya Sinwar in Rafah in southern Gaza. His death left his younger brother, Mohammed, as the de facto leader of Hamas in Gaza, which put him squarely in Israel’s crosshairs.
Ever since his brother’s death, Sinwar had been pre-eminent among the leaders of Hamas’ military wing inside Gaza. He was intimately involved in the planning for Hamas’ October 7 attacks, which saw more than 1,200 people in Israel killed and another roughly 250 taken hostage. A video of him in the tunnels purportedly leading towards Israeli territory surfaced several weeks after the attacks.
By most accounts, Sinwar was ruthlessly determined to keep up the fight, despite the loss of thousands of fighters in Hamas military wing and the deepening suffering of Gaza’s civilians, as well as sporadic street protests in Gaza against Hamas.
Some commentators believe that Mohammed Sinwar lacked the broader authority enjoyed by Yahya. Haaretz security analyst Amos Harel writes that he shared “leadership responsibilities in Gaza with Az al-Din al-Haddad, a commander whose power base lies in the north of the Strip.”
Impact on ceasefire negotiations
Muhammad Shehada at the European Council on Foreign Relations says his death would complicate the negotiation process as Hamas reorganizes a shrinking leadership within Gaza. Without those leaders, he says, Hamas becomes more de-centralized and a ceasefire is more difficult to enforce.
Avi Issacharoff, a commentator with media outlet Ynet, says Sinwar’s death “may open the door for more pragmatic voices within Hamas’ leadership, such as Khalil al-Hayya and others currently involved in negotiations with Qatar and the Americans.”
The balance between that leadership and its negotiators abroad has always been hard to assess, but Shehada says the Hamas negotiators “perfectly represent the movement” and had already made countless concessions on a much-diminished post-conflict role, including allowing an international peacekeeping force and giving up governance.
“They are at their most lenient now” in the face of an Israeli government that is not prepared to negotiate beyond a temporary ceasefire, says Shehada.
There is plentiful evidence that Mohammed Sinwar was as hardline as his brother, perhaps even more so.
In a rare interview with Al Jazeera in 2021, Sinwar said: “We know how to identify the pain points of the occupation, how to pressure it.” He was speaking after Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) launched more than 4,000 rockets toward Israel.
Speaking in silhouette, Sinwar spoke of expanding Hamas’ ambitions.
“Tel Aviv has been placed on the table since the first day of the battle… Striking Tel Aviv is easier than taking a sip of water.”
By the time he was killed he had accumulated 30 years of military experience.
Living in the shadows
Sinwar was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in 1975 and was first arrested for militant activities as a teenager. He became the leader of Hamas’ Khan Younis brigade and is said to have played a key role in the Hamas operation that captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, according to the Counter Extremism Project, and in insisting on his brother’s release from an Israeli prison in return for Shalit’s freedom.
Muhammad Shehada says Sinwar lived more in the shadows than his brother and others in Hamas’ leadership and had a more rigid security environment, almost to the point of paranoia.
“After an assassination attempt in 2003 he vanished, and did not take a public role in his father’s funeral” in 2022, according to Michael Barak, head of the Global Jihad Research Program at the International Institute for Counter Terrorism in Israel.
The evidence of the past few months suggests he was an able tactician. Time and again, the Israeli military had to return to areas of Gaza it had previously scoured for Hamas fighters.
While Hamas has lost as many as 20,000 fighters, according to an assessment by the Israeli military in January, it has maintained its presence in many parts of Gaza, even occasionally firing rockets towards Israel. In a report last month, the International Crisis Group think tank said that despite those losses, Hamas had managed to recruit thousands more fighters.
However, Shahada says that the Israeli campaign has seriously degraded Hamas and it is now more of a guerrilla group than a threat to its neighbor. Killing Sinwar won’t change that, he says.
Despite Sinwar’s death, Yaakov Amidror, a former National Security Advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “It is likely that we will need to continue fighting for at least a year, in order to clean the Strip of remnants of Hamas rule, terrorists, and infrastructure.” Only then, Amidror told the Jewish News Syndicate, could a new form of government be introduced to Gaza.
Shehada believes that Israel’s attempt to kill Sinwar the day after it released US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander will “make it harder for Hamas to trust anything the mediators or the US says…. it’s the perfect signal that no amount of guarantees from the mediators will suffice to enforce a ceasefire even if one is reached.”
But what happens in Gaza next may depend as much as on the pressure being exerted by Washington on the Israeli government to end the conflict as on the leadership of Hamas.
Amos Harel at Haaretz believes that “whether he lives or dies is no longer the central question. The course of the war now hinges on a different factor entirely: what (US) President (Donald) Trump does next – and whether he succeeds in imposing his terms on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”","['Oren Liebermann', 'Tim Lister']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/middleeast/lebanon-pm-nawaf-salam-us-israel-withdraw-latam-intl,"‘We want Israel out yesterday, not tomorrow:’ Lebanon’s leader urges US to pressure Israel to withdraw troops",2025-05-28 16:10:43,"Israel’s military occupation in parts of southern Lebanon is undermining Beirut’s attempts to restore sovereignty over a nation reeling from decades of conflict, the country’s prime minister has told CNN.
Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said he would like to see the current United States administration put pressure on Israel to withdraw from five locations in southern Lebanon.
A US-mediated agreement in November last year paused months of fighting between the Israeli military and Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed militant group that operates in Lebanon. Israel has significantly weakened Hezbollah over the past year, killing much of its top leadership and severely degrading its power through mass airstrikes.
The prime minister said Lebanon has been honoring its commitments to the November agreement and that the Lebanese military is “consolidating control” over the south of the country and its borders.
Hezbollah is committed to an agreement that affirms that the Lebanese military is the only authority allowed to bear arms, Salam said Wednesday. However, “Israel has not honored its commitments,” he added.
The “Israeli presence in Lebanon is a red line for everyone. This is not a red line for Hezbollah alone,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson in Dubai, where he’s attending the Arab Media Forum and meeting Emirati leadership.
“Israel’s argument is as follows… they need to be in these five points in order to have a better monitoring of the situation in southern Lebanon… but we are not in World War One…we are in the age of satellite imagery, of drones with cameras. They have balloons monitoring the region, let alone a network of spies operating on the ground,” Salam said.
“Israel’s presence is politically counterproductive. It’s undermining my government…we want Israel out yesterday, not tomorrow.”
Despite agreeing to withdraw from Lebanese territory as part of the US-mediated agreement, Israel has said that the Lebanese army has yet to take control of a region with Hezbollah presence. Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, said in March that the Israeli military would remain in these five points “indefinitely, to protect the residents of the north – regardless of any future negotiations.”
Along with the United States, France and the United Nations are monitoring the ceasefire.
“I’m sure they can testify that Lebanon has been honoring its commitments while Israel has not honored its commitments,” Salam said on the mediating countries.
Salam, who rose to prominence after presiding over the International Court of Justice during South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, was designated Lebanon’s prime minister in January in a surprise move that was seen as a blow to Hezbollah and its allies.
Widely seen as a reformist, the prime minister declared specific priorities for his mandate, including ending institutional corruption and regaining sovereignty over his country by disarming Hezbollah and Palestinian factions.
“The goal… is that the state should have exclusive monopoly over arms, over all its territory,” he said in the interview.",['Mostafa Salem'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/middleeast/ehud-olmert-criticizes-gaza-war-oped-intl,Ehud Olmert: Former Israeli PM blasts war in Gaza,2025-05-28 11:16:14,"Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert has blasted the country’s political leadership and the conduct of its military, telling CNN he is no longer able to defend Israel against accusations of war crimes.
Olmert, who led the country from 2006-2009, pointed to Israel’s 11-week blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the soaring number of Palestinians killed.
“What is it if not a war crime?” he asked rhetorically in an interview with CNN. He said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right members of his government are “committing actions which can’t be interpreted any other way.”
Since the start of the war, Olmert has defended Israel abroad against accusations of genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza. When women and children were killed, Olmert said he told officials and interviewers that Israel would not deliberately target civilians.
But 19 months into a war Olmert says should have ended a year ago, he believes he can no longer make that case. CNN spoke to Olmert following the publication of an op-ed by the former prime minister that was published in Israel’s Haaretz newspaper on Tuesday, in which he wrote: “What we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians.”
CNN has asked the Prime Minister’s Office for comment on Olmert’s op-ed.
More than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, including at least 28,000 women and children. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in January that it had killed more than 20,000 Hamas fighters.
“I think that we have to make sure that no uninvolved people in Gaza are hurt because of the expansion of these military operations, which is entirely unjustified and doesn’t serve any important interests of the state of Israel at this point,” Olmert said.
Olmert, who spent 16 months in prison on corruption charges, leveled most of his criticism at Netanyahu, as well as far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.
“I hope that this government will disappear as soon as possible,” he told CNN. “I believe that the majority of Israelis are sick and tired of these policies, of these statements, of what the terrible damage that was caused by this government to the moral integrity of the state of Israel and the people of Israel.”
Polls in Israel have repeatedly shown that most of the country supports a comprehensive ceasefire agreement that would see the release of the remaining 58 hostages held in Gaza and an end to the war. But Netanyahu has refused to commit to an end to the war, insisting that Israel’s expanding military campaign in Gaza will continue until the defeat of Hamas.
Like the hostage families, many of whom have given up on Netanyahu, Olmert placed his hope in US President Donald Trump to end the war. Trump, he said, is one of the only people who has the ability to compel Netanyahu to end the war.
“I really certainly think that he is the only person perhaps that can force the Israeli prime minister to come to terms with reality and with the moral reality of what is being accomplished by this government,” he told CNN.",['Oren Liebermann'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/middleeast/freed-israeli-hostages-fears-intl,Freed Israeli hostages fear for those still held captive by Hamas,2025-05-28 10:03:50,"Keith Siegel has been free for nearly four months, but he is still pained by vivid images of his 484 days as a Hamas hostage and of those still held in Gaza’s tunnels.
“It haunts me daily,” Siegel, a dual US-Israeli citizen, told CNN. “Everything that they’re experiencing is very difficult for me to think about. I can’t get those thoughts out of my mind.”
Siegel isn’t just talking about the physical and psychological abuse he was subjected to by his captors or the suffocating conditions and malnutrition he faced in tunnels deep underground. He’s also terrified that Israel’s intensifying bombardment and ground offensive will kill the remaining living hostages – or drive Hamas to execute them.
Hamas and other militant groups kidnapped 251 people from Israel during the October 7, 2023 terror attacks.
As Israel marks 600 days since the war began, Siegel and dozens of former hostages and relatives are renewing their call for a deal that will end the conflict and secure the release of all 58 still held captive, living and dead. Protesters blocked roads in Tel Aviv on Wednesday and gathered in Hostage Square and in front of the US embassy to put pressure on the Israeli government to make a deal with Hamas and return the remaining hostages.
For Omer Shem Tov, among the last of the hostages to be released before the ceasefire collapsed in March, there is an ever-present feeling of guilt. Every time he eats, he thinks about the hostages not eating. Every time he showers, he knows those still captive in Gaza cannot.
“I can feel it here,” he says, pointing at his throat. “I feel like I’m being choked.”
Like many other released hostages, Siegel and Shem Tov have dedicated much of their newfound freedom to advocating for the release of those left behind.
Shem Tov, 22, considers the hostages his brothers and sisters, after everything they have endured. “I will fight for my family,” he told CNN. “They’re going through hell. And time is critical.”
Most of the Israeli public wants to see a ceasefire deal to bring the remaining hostages home, according to numerous polls, but as those who survived captivity, the freed hostages are the movement’s most powerful voices. They see their advocacy as a near-sacred obligation to those still in Gaza.
“The hostages’ lives are now more critical than eliminating Hamas,” said Shem Tov.
Meanwhile, Siegel has raised awareness about the horrific conditions of captivity he endured and the dangers the remaining hostages face.
Speaking from his daughter’s home in northern Israel, Siegel looked healthier than when he was released in February. He has regained some of the weight he lost in captivity, color has returned to his face and he has been spending time with his family and out in nature. But his mind is never far from the tunnels of Gaza and thoughts of Matan Angrest, a 22-year-old Israeli soldier, and Omri Miran, a 48-year-old father-of-two, with whom he was held.
“I think about them every day. Many times a day. And I worry about them – and I miss them,” Siegel said.
Siegel and Miran were held together for nearly five months, until July 2024, passing the time by talking about their shared taste in music and their love for their families. Miran has two daughters – Alma and Ronni, now aged 2 and 4 – whose names easily rolled off Siegel’s tongue.
“It was very difficult for Omri to think about his daughters growing up without their dad and how hard it was for him to think about him missing their growing-up, their development milestones,” Siegel said.
Miran called out directly to Siegel in a hostage video released by Hamas last month. Siegel said his fellow former captive looked like “a different person… in a negative way.”
Siegel hesitates to describe his relationship with Angrest as one of a father and his son, but it’s clear they built a special bond during the 67 days they were locked in a very small room, sharing a single bed. Angrest helped Siegel improve his Arabic, talked about his love of the Maccabi Haifa soccer team and day-dreamt about sharing a meal together at his parents’ home and seeing a match once they’re free.
Siegel said he, Angrest and Miran used to pray that the Israeli military would rescue them in a daring operation. But that all changed in August when Hamas executed six hostages as Israeli troops closed in on their location. Siegel learned about it in captivity and his dreams quickly turned into nightmares.
“I was afraid that the IDF might try to rescue me and that I might be killed by the captors,” Siegel recalled. “It’s something that worries me in regards to the hostages that are still there.”
He added that he believes Israel’s expanding military operations now increase the threats to the hostages’ lives, even as the Israeli military has pledged to take precautions to avoid harming the remaining captives.
“Hostages were killed from the war,” Siegel said. “I think this can be avoided by getting all of the hostages back. That’s the solution, to get them back – to reach an agreement that will bring them back.”
Shem Tov echoed his fears. The scariest moments in captivity, he said, were when Israeli bombs fell around him, weapons he knew were powerful enough where “your life can be taken in every moment.”
“I was scared of dying from my own people, from my own brothers,” said Shem Tov.
Siegel and Shem Tov have met with US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and called on both to prioritize reaching a deal to free the hostages. While the Israeli prime minister has made clear he believes defeating Hamas is more important than freeing the hostages, many hostage advocates are placing their hopes in Trump’s hands.
“I am home because of his efforts,” Siegel said. “I believe that he wants to do this and it’s important to him. He has told us that. I ask him to do whatever he can and to do it as soon as possible to get an agreement secured and to get them all back.”
Shem Tov also believed he was freed because of Trump’s efforts. During their meeting in the Oval Office at the White House in March, Shem Tov said Trump told him “that I have a good future ahead of me.”
Shem Tov lost most than 50 pounds in captivity, he said. His food dwindled from just two pitas and some cheese daily at the beginning to a single biscuit.
However, he said his treatment at the hands of Hamas improved after Trump’s election, including receiving more food.
Hamas also “stopped cursing me, stopped spitting on me,” he said.
He frequently talked politics with his captors and said they wanted Kamala Harris to win the US election.
“As soon as Donald Trump was elected, they understood that he wants to bring the hostages back home,” Shem Tov said.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Bianna Golodryga', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/middleeast/germany-merz-criticizes-israel-latam-intl,Germany’s leader has criticized Israel’s conduct in Gaza. Here’s why that’s a big deal,2025-05-27 18:04:16,"For decades, Germany has stood squarely in Israel’s corner, its dark history of Jewish persecution shaping its modern-day policy of virtually unquestioned backing.
In the aftermath of the Hamas October 7, 2023, attacks, the question of German political and military support for Israel was raised – and reaffirmed by then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
But comments by new Chancellor Friedrich Merz in recent days have put Germany’s support for Israel under the spotlight.
“We are dismayed by the fate of the civilian population and the terrible suffering of the civilian population” in Gaza, the chancellor said on Tuesday while on a visit to Turku, Finland.
The question of what provoked Merz’s sharp change in tone toward Israel remains unclear. Peter Lintl, an analyst from the German Institute of International and Security Affairs who focuses on German-Israeli relations, believes Merz wanted to get into office, start conversations with Israeli leaders and get an understanding of the direction of travel before outlining his stance.
“The conclusion, that most of the countries in the world came to, it’s a horrible war where the aim is not clear anymore,” Lintl told CNN. “It is clearly a change in tone and change in positioning of the German government.”
Merz followed his Tuesday comments by questioning the current actions of the Israel Defense Forces inside Gaza.
Referring to Israel’s expanded operations and the humanitarian crisis in the territory, the German chancellor said that he “no longer sees any logic as to how they serve the goal of fighting terror and freeing the hostages. In this respect, I take a very, very critical view of what has happened in the last few days.”
Tuesday’s language came hot on the heels of a thinly veiled threat from Merz in Berlin on Monday. “The Israeli government must not do anything that its best friends are no longer prepared to accept,” he said.
Merz has also done the previously unthinkable and questioned whether Israel may be violating international law.
National interest
The change of tone is particularly striking because of Germany’s long-standing stance on Israel, that is connected to a theory known as “staatsraison” or national interest.
The connection of staatsraison and Israel were made by then-Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2008.
She told the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, that the “historical responsibility of Germany is part of my country’s national interest (staatsraison). This means that, for me as German chancellor, Israel’s security is never negotiable.”
Similar words were also used by Scholz in the wake of the October 7 attacks in which Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapped some 250 others.
Since Merkel’s speech, and particularly after she stepped down as chancellor in 2021, “the term got a life of its own,” the analyst Lintl says.
“It appeared that if you want to be a respected politician, you have to use the term because it came to signal … that Israel’s security is German staatsraison. It is the minimum threshold we use to distance ourselves from the past,” Lintl says.
That “past” refers largely to the Holocaust in which the Nazis killed more than 6 million Jews.
In Finland on Tuesday, Merz was quick to reiterate he is not abandoning staatsraison entirely. “Israel’s security and existence are, as we have been saying for many years and decades, part of our German staatsraison,” but he has clearly set out to clarify it.
Lintl added: “We didn’t know how this government will conduct itself, or how this government policy toward Israel will look – right now we have more of an idea.”
It remains unclear if Merz and Germany’s relationship with Israel will shift significantly.
Merz has maintained he will continue to talk with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Merz has also said he would find “ways and means” for Israel’s prime minister to visit Germany given the ICC (International Criminal Court) arrest warrant out for him.
For now, the statements from Israel seem muted, and respectful.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany Ron Prosor told German TV Tuesday morning, “when somebody criticizes Israel, and when Friedrich Merz makes this criticism, we listen very carefully because he is a friend.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/26/middleeast/us-envoy-gaza-ceasefire-deal-intl,"US envoy says Gaza ceasefire deal is on the table, as Israel prepares to launch an ‘unprecedented attack’",2025-05-19 00:00:00,"US special envoy Steve Witkoff has told CNN that a ceasefire-hostage deal for Gaza is currently on the table with a pathway to end the war, and urged Hamas to accept it.
The proposal would see the release of half of the living hostages and half of those who have died in exchange for a temporary ceasefire before negotiations begin for a comprehensive agreement to end the war.
He declined to specify how long that temporary truce would last, which has been a key issue in the negotiations.
“Israel will agree to a temporary ceasefire/hostage deal that would see half of the living and half of the deceased return and lead to substantive negotiations to find a path to a permanent ceasefire, which I have agreed to preside over,” Witkoff told CNN on Monday. “That deal is on the table. Hamas should take it.”
He said Hamas has yet to accept the deal.
Reuters reported earlier on Monday that Hamas had agreed to a proposal that would see the release of 10 hostages in two groups in exchange for a 70-day truce. Witkoff told CNN that was not his proposal.
“What I have seen is completely unacceptable,” Witkoff said, referring to the report.
Meanwhile, a Palestinian official close to the negotiations also told CNN that Hamas has agreed to Witkoff’s proposal, but did not provide additional details about what the deal entailed.
A US official told CNN Witkoff has not met directly with Hamas. According to a source familiar with the matter, Palestinian-American businessman Bishara Bahbah met with Hamas in Doha about the proposal. Bahbah, who led the group “Arab Americans for Trump” during the 2024 presidential campaign, has been working on behalf of the administration.
Witkoff’s comments to CNN mark the first time he has said he would preside over negotiations for an end to the war during the temporary ceasefire.
Hamas has long sought assurances that Israel seriously engages in negotiations to end the war if it agrees to another temporary ceasefire, after Israel refused to do so during the last truce. Witkoff’s involvement in negotiating a permanent ceasefire appears to be aimed at providing Hamas with assurances from Washington that Israel will engage in such negotiations in the future.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli government for comment.
In a video message posted to social media on Monday night, Netanyahu said getting the hostages released is a top priority.
“I very much hope we’ll have something to announce on that front,” he said. “And if not today, then tomorrow – we are not giving up.”
Two Israeli officials later clarified that there was “no progress” in the negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal and that “Hamas continued to hold firm in its refusal.”
“The prime minister meant that a breakthrough could happen only if Hamas aligns with the Israeli position,” one of the officials said.
Plans for an ‘unprecedented attack’
The proposal comes at a crucial point in the war, as the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for most of southern Gaza ahead of what its spokesperson said would be an “unprecedented attack” on the territory.
The order covers the city of Khan Younis and much of the surrounding area, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic language spokesperson Avichay Adree. He described the Khan Younis governorate as a “dangerous fighting zone that has been warned several times.”
The evacuation zone goes all the way south to the Gaza-Egypt border where Israeli forces have occupied the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8-mile) strip along the frontier. It appears to include the entirety of Khan Younis, a densely packed city with many displaced Palestinians. The order instructs Palestinians to move to the Al-Mawasi area, a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea.
Earlier Monday, the IDF said three rockets were fired from southern Gaza, two of which landed within the Gazan territory and one of which was intercepted.
The order, which also cover parts of eastern Gaza, comes after the military laid out its strategy to take control of the territory, where it has been fighting a war since October 2023 to eradicate Hamas following the militant group’s attack on Israel.
An Israeli military official told CNN on Monday that Israel plans to occupy 75% of Gaza within two months as part of its new offensive.
If carried out, the plan would force more than two million Palestinians into a quarter of the coastal enclave, surrounded on nearly all sides by Israeli forces. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this month the entire population would be displaced to southern Gaza.
The IDF now has five divisions operating in Gaza, the military said Friday, totaling tens of thousands of troops. On a visit to troops in Khan Younis Sunday, IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said, “You are fighting on the central front of the state of Israel. This is a prolonged, multi-arena war.”
On Monday, Hamas’ Government Media Office said Israel already “effectively” controls 77% of Gaza through “heavy firepower that prevents Palestinian civilians from accessing their homes, areas, lands, and properties, or through oppressive forced evacuation policies.”
Israel is under growing international pressure – including from long standing allies – over its decision to expand the war and, in the words of one Israeli minister, “conquer” the territory.
The United Kingdom has paused trade talks and sanctioned extremist settlers in the West Bank. Canada and France have threatened sanctions. And the European Union – Israel’s biggest trade partner – is reviewing its landmark Association Agreement with the country.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told German public broadcaster ARD on Monday that the actions of the Israeli military in Gaza “can no longer be justified on the grounds of a fight against Hamas terrorism.”
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, however, reiterated US support for Israel on Sunday.
She met with Netanyahu and expressed appreciation for the prime minister’s conduct of the war, according to a statement from the Israeli Government Press Office.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/26/middleeast/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-aid-resigns-intl-hnk,"Head of controversial US-backed Gaza aid group resigns, citing concerns over independence and impartiality",2025-05-26 04:38:34,"The head of a new aid distribution program for Gaza, backed by the US and Israel, resigned on Sunday after weeks of controversy, citing concerns over impartiality and urging Israel to allow more aid into the blockaded enclave.
On Monday, the group said it had began operations in Gaza, however it is not yet clear whether the aid has reached civilians.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is meant to run a new, tightly controlled, mechanism for aid deliveries into Gaza, but it has been criticized by the United Nations and others, who warn it risks further displacing Palestinians and endangering civilians.
US military veteran Jake Wood quit as GHF’s executive director after just a matter of weeks at the organization, publicly launched by the US in early May.
“I am proud of the work I oversaw, including developing a pragmatic plan that could feed hungry people, address security concerns about diversion, and complement the work of longstanding NGOs in Gaza,” said Wood in a statement.
“However, it is clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon,” he added.
The GHF said in a statement it was “disappointed” by Wood’s resignation, criticizing opponents who they said “have been more focused on tearing this apart than on getting aid in.” On Monday it announced the interim executive director would be John Acree, a “a senior humanitarian practitioner with more than two decades of global field experience in disaster response, stabilization programming, and civil-military coordination.”
The organization said it delivered truckloads of food to its secure distribution sites, on Monday “where distribution to the Gazan people began.”
The statement added that more aid trucks would be delivered the following day and that the flow of aid would increase daily.
The foundation released pictures showing men carrying cardboard boxes by hand on their shoulders. The foundation said the pictures were taken in Rafah. CNN has been unable to geolocate the images.
The GHF’s plan for delivering aid has been approved by Israel and the US, which both countries say is designed to prevent Hamas from “stealing” aid.
The organization said in its Monday statement that Hamas was making “death threats targeting aid groups supporting humanitarian operations at GHF’s Safe Distribution Sites.”
“It is clear that Hamas is threatened by this new operating model, and will do everything in its power to see it fail,” GHF said.
The group is supposed to start operating four distribution sites, all located in southern and central Gaza – but it has come under heavy criticism from top humanitarian officials, with the UN and other organizations refusing to work with the new group.
The UN warned that the fact the initial sites were only in southern and central Gaza could be seen as encouraging Israel’s publicly stated goal of forcing “the entire Gazan population” out of northern Gaza, as Defense Minister Israel Katz put it earlier this month.
The US and the GHF have both been at pains to say that it is not an Israeli initiative – despite Israel’s support for it, and its role in designating and securing the distribution sites.
Speaking to CNN earlier in May, Wood had urged the UN and other groups to reconsider their opposition, admitting that the plan was “not perfect,” but would allow critical aid and food supplies to Gazans who desperately need it.
He added in May that he “unequivocally… will not be a part of anything that forcibly dislocates or displaces the Palestinian population.”
In his resignation statement on Sunday, he said he had sought to establish the foundation “as a truly independent humanitarian entity” during his time as its executive director.
Wood said he was “horrified and heartbroken at the hunger crisis in Gaza” and was “compelled to do whatever I could to help alleviate the suffering.”
“I urge Israel to significantly expand the provision of aid into Gaza through all mechanisms, and I urge all stakeholders to continue to explore innovative new methods for the delivery of aid, without delay, diversion, or discrimination,” Wood said.
The GHF is only expected to be able to feed about 60% of Gaza’s population in its first weeks.
A private American security contractor will be responsible for guarding its aid trucks from the Gaza border to the distribution sites and will not be involved in distributing the aid to civilians, Wood had previously said.
Starvation in Gaza
Gaza faces widespread starvation amid a severe shortage of essential humanitarian aid. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has recorded 58 deaths from malnutrition and 242 deaths from shortages of food and medicine since Israel’s blockade on aid began in March, it said.
More than 300 miscarriages had been attributed to a lack of nutrients, the ministry told CNN on Sunday.
Last week, Israel said it would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza due to an “operational need” as the military pushes ahead with its offensive, dubbed “Gideon’s Chariots.” The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office has said a hunger crisis in Gaza could jeopardize the operation, which Israel says aims to defeat Hamas.
Ahmad Al-Banna, who owns a bakery in Deir al-Balah in Gaza, told CNN Sunday that he had reopened on Wednesday, only to close three days later, because flour stocks had run out.
“Gaza is exhausted,” he said. “There are starving people in the streets.”
Another resident, Um Jamal Musleh, said she and her two children relied on the local charity-run kitchen. “Today, we were shocked to see a sign saying it’s the last day for the kitchen. That means we’ll go hungry,” she said.
Asmaa Al-Kafarneh, who was waiting at the kitchen on Sunday, said she had not eaten bread in two months. “If we don’t die from Israeli airstrikes, we’ll die of hunger,” she said.
Israel said it allowed 107 aid trucks into the territory on Sunday and 170 on Monday – but the UN has said that’s not nearly enough.
The enclave needs at least 500 to 600 trucks daily to avert a deepening humanitarian catastrophe, as civilians face a severe shortage of supplies like food and medicine, said UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza. The UN has also complained that Israel has insisted on humanitarian aid traveling along insecure routes, preventing many aid trucks from safely arriving at their destinations.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Hira Humayun', 'Jessie Yeung']",en

Na’ama Levy, one of five IDF female soldiers released in January, made the comments during a weekly rally at Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square on Sunday demanding the return of hostages.
“They (strikes) come unexpectedly. At first you hear the whistles, you pray that it won’t fall on us, and then – the explosions, a noise so loud that it paralyzes the body, and the ground shakes,” Levy told a crowd of thousands.
“Every time, I was sure that this was the end of me. It was one of the scariest things I experienced there and that’s also what endangered me more than anything,” she continued, describing an incident where a strike caused the house she was in to partially collapse.
“That was my reality. It’s their reality now,” she said, referring to those still in captivity.
“Even now, at this very moment, there are hostages who hear those whistles and explosions, they’re there trembling with fear. They have nowhere to run, only to pray and cling to the walls with a terrible feeling of helplessness.”
The comments from Levy come as the families of Israeli captives held in Gaza intensify their criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and as Israel comes under growing pressure to end the war in Gaza.
Earlier this month, Netanyahu said that defeating Israel’s enemies is the “supreme objective” and more important than securing the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza – drawing backlash from representatives of hostage families.
Levy urged for the return of all Israeli hostages, saying there will be “no victory” otherwise.
“There’s no way in (Israel) they really understand what we’re going through and are still leaving us in Gaza.”
In the early months of the war, another Israeli hostage expressed similar fears of being killed by Israeli strikes, Israeli media outlet Ynet reported, based on audio it said was leaked from a meeting between released hostages, their families, and Netanyahu.
The fear was that “it would not be Hamas, but Israel, that would kill us, and then they would say Hamas killed you,” said the hostage, who was released in one of the first deals.
Levy’s comments on Sunday also came after Netanyahu appointed a new chief for the country’s Shin Bet security agency on Friday, Maj. Gen David Zini, who has reportedly voiced opposition to hostage deals. The families of hostages have blasted the choice.
According to Israel’s Channel 12 News, Zini said in meetings of IDF general staff: “I oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war.” The report does not provide a specific date for Zini’s comments. Channel 12 says it was a position he repeated often over the past year.
“If the report is accurate, these are shocking statements, worthy of unequivocal condemnation, especially coming from someone who is expected to hold the fate of the hostages in his hands,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement at the time.
In his previous position as the head of the Training Command and General Staff Corps in the IDF, Zini had little influence on hostage negotiations. But as head of the Shin Bet, he could have a significant role considering the agency’s participation in previous rounds of indirect negotiations with Hamas.
“Appointing a Shin Bet chief who prioritizes (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s war over the return of the hostages is a sin upon a crime and an injustice to the entire people of Israel - a blow to the value of solidarity and the sacred duty to leave no one behind,” the forum said.
In recent weeks, Israel has come under growing pressure to end the war in Gaza as the enclave faces widespread starvation amid a severe shortage of humanitarian aid.
The United Kingdom has paused trade talks and sanctioned extremist settlers in the West Bank. Canada and France have threatened sanctions. And the European Union – Israel’s biggest trade partner – is reviewing its landmark Association Agreement with the country. In the words of one Israeli minister, their patience has worn thin over Israel’s decision to expand the war.

According to Israel’s Channel 12 News, Maj. Gen. David Zini said in meetings of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) general staff: “I oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war.” The report does not provide a specific date for the Zini’s comments. Channel 12 says it was a position he repeated often over the past year.
“If the report is accurate, these are shocking statements, worthy of unequivocal condemnation, especially coming from someone who is expected to hold the fate of the hostages in his hands,” said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in a statement on Friday.
In his current position as the head of the Training Command and General Staff Corps in the IDF, Zini has little influence on hostage negotiations and his personal beliefs are largely irrelevant to the process. But if confirmed as head of the Shin Bet, Zini could have a significant role considering the agency’s participation in previous rounds of indirect negotiations with Hamas.
“Appointing a Shin Bet chief who prioritizes (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s war over the return of the hostages is a sin upon a crime and an injustice to the entire people of Israel - a blow to the value of solidarity and the sacred duty to leave no one behind,” the forum said.
When asked for comment, the IDF said it “does not on comment on content discussed in General Staff deliberations.”
Zini’s career in the military has mostly been as a field officer with little experience in intelligence, which is a core aspect of the Shin Bet, officially called the Israel Security Agency.
Ruby Chen, the father of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen, whose body is still held in Gaza, said on social media that “Netanyahu appoints to key positions people who lack the relevant skills in order to control the system.”
Netanyahu announced Zini’s nomination on Thursday, one day after Israel’s Supreme Court ruled that he had a conflict of interest in firing the previous Shin Bet chief, Ronen Bar, and could not appoint a replacement.
In its decision, the court said the firing “was made when the Prime Minister had a conflict of interest in light of the investigations into the affairs of his associates; that the decision was made without a factual foundation; and without a proper hearing being held for the Shin Bet head.”
On Thursday, the Attorney General said: “The Prime Minister acted contrary to legal guidance, there is serious concern that he acted when he is in a conflict of interest, and the appointment process is flawed.”
But Netanyahu proceeded with the appointment anyway. The Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement on Friday defending the decision. “This is an urgent security necessity, and any delay harms the security of the state and the safety of our soldiers,” it said. Netanyahu said on Friday that he has known Zini for years.
The choice of Zini as an active-duty general was also unprecedented, prompting the IDF’s Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir to issue a statement saying that Zini would retire “in the upcoming days” before he can take up the civilian Shin Bet post.
The pick appeared to surprise the country’s top general, who emphasized that “any discourse conducted by IDF soldiers with the political echelon must be approved by the Chief of General Staff.”","['Dana Karni', 'Tamar Michaelis', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/24/middleeast/israel-pressure-from-allies-war-gaza-intl-cmd,Israel is facing unprecedented pressure from allies over its war on Gaza. Can they force it to change its ways?,2025-05-24 10:00:52,"After 19 months of pounding Gaza, Israel is now under growing pressure from unlikely quarters – some of its closest Western allies.
Their patience has worn thin over Israel’s decision to expand the war and, in the words of one Israeli minister, “conquer” the territory – a move paired with plans to forcibly displace Gaza’s entire population to the south and block all humanitarian aid for 11 weeks.
The United Kingdom has paused trade talks and sanctioned extremist settlers in the West Bank. Canada and France have threatened sanctions. And the European Union – Israel’s biggest trade partner – is reviewing its landmark Association Agreement with the country.
Aid groups have warned that the situation in Gaza is becoming catastrophic, with the United Nations’ humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher last week calling on the world to “act decisively to prevent genocide.”
Dozens of babies have died of malnutrition, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and more than 53,000 people – or 4% of the entire population – have been killed since Israel launched its war following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas and its allies.
The fact that some of Israel’s closest allies are now pushing back more vocally marks a major shift in attitudes toward the country.
Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN that just two years ago, it would have been unimaginable for Europe to even talk about the possibility of rethinking the Association Agreement. “It was something that was widely seen as a taboo and unrealistic.”
The agreement, which covers various forms of cooperation between the two parties, including the free movement of goods and scientific collaboration, has been in place for 25 years. “The mere fact that this is being discussed seriously today is a sign of not just the increasing frustration, and I think also, let’s be quite clear, anger, in some European capitals over Israeli actions in Gaza,” said Lovatt.
The punitive steps threatened by the EU and other allies are designed in part to sway the domestic debate inside Israel, where society is already extremely divided over the war.
The government, propped up by hardliners from far-right parties, is determined to keep fighting in Gaza. But hundreds of thousands of Israelis demonstrate against the war each week, demanding the government agrees a ceasefire deal to release all the hostages still held in the strip.
In an opinion poll published by Israel’s Channel 12 broadcaster earlier this month, 61% of those surveyed favored ending the war for a deal that secures the hostage release, while only 25% supported the expanded military operation.
That notwithstanding, Arie Reich, a legal scholar at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University who specializes in international trade and EU law, said that external pressure on Netanyahu’s government may not have the desired effect.
“When foreign countries try to interfere in internal matters of another country, especially things that are very dear to them, such as their national security, it usually works as a boomerang, and it actually causes the people to support the government even more,” he said.
“There is a wide consensus in Israel that we want to release our hostages, and that we do not want to go back to where we were on October 6. We don’t want to have this threat of Hamas lingering over us,” Reich said.
But he added that the moves by some of Israel’s allies have made it clear that the “window of using military force is starting to close.”
“And maybe, if it goes on longer than that, I think it’s going to be very hard to maintain normal relations with many countries in the West,” he said.
Israel has so far brushed aside the threats from its Western allies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused them of “offering a huge prize” to the October 7 attackers, while Israel’s foreign ministry said that “external pressure will not divert Israel from its path in the fight for its existence and security against enemies seeking its destruction.”
This determination to continue may be due to Netanyahu believing that he can, for now at least, rely on the United States for support.
And while the moves are diplomatically symbolic, critics expect little to change on the ground for Palestinians.
Omar Barghouti, the co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a global campaign aimed at pressuring Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian land, told CNN that unless Israel’s allies totally stop support for Israel, their actions will yield few results.
Short of a total arms embargo and a full suspension of economic relations, Israel is unlikely to change its ways, he said, arguing that Canada, France and the UK had been “complicit” in Israel’s actions in Gaza by providing it with “military, intelligence, economic, and diplomatic support.”
All three countries have longstanding agreements with Israel that include defense and security cooperation, although the detail of what exactly these contain is unclear.
The UK and France have suspended some arms licenses to Israel over the situation in Gaza but have continued to export military equipment worth tens of millions of dollars to Israel. Canada has said that no export permits on military goods to Israel have been issued since January 8, 2024.
Israel’s most powerful backer stands by it
As Israel’s most powerful ally, the US has the most sway over Netanyahu and his government. And while some in the Trump administration have criticized Israel over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, there has been no indication the US would take any punitive actions against it.
It isn’t, however, a “foregone conclusion that the US will continue to always unequivocally back Israel,” Lovatt said.
“While I don’t see a rupture in relations, clearly, the arrival of the second Trump administration has created an interesting dynamic, given the influence of what I would call the ‘America Firsters,’ those in the MAGA world who want to put the US first in everything, and that has, to a certain extent, also applied to Israel,” he said.
The US has moved out of step with Israel on number of issues in recent weeks.
It has struck a ceasefire deal with Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels without first informing Israel; unilaterally negotiated with Hamas the release of US citizen Edan Alexander from Gaza; and, according to a Reuters report, has dropped its demand for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel as a condition for US investment and potential US arms deals.
Addressing Israel’s criticism over the deal with the Houthis, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told Israeli media that the US “isn’t required to get permission from Israel” to get an agreement that protects its ships.
“Netanyahu has positioned himself as a master of the US political game, and as someone who’s best placed to manage and maintain tight Israel relations and to keep any US presidential administration on side. I think seeing some daylight between the Trump administration and the Israeli government clearly puts pressure on Netanyahu,” Lovatt said.
US officials told CNN that US President Donald Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu, but stressed these frustrations do not amount to a change in posture in terms of US support for Israel, a country which the president continues to view as one of America’s strongest allies.
There are signs that some in Israel are worried about the consequences of its actions in Gaza. The leader of Israel’s opposition left-wing Democrats party, retired Israeli general Yair Golan, warned on Tuesday that Israel is “on its way to becoming a pariah state.”
The impact of the pressure from the allies was on display on Sunday, when the Israeli military announced it would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza as it launched its new offensive in the strip, which Israel says is intended to pressure Hamas to release the hostages held there.
Netanyahu conceded on Monday that if “a situation of famine” arose in Gaza, Israel “simply won’t receive international support.”
In a statement posted to Telegram, he added that even US senators “who have been staunch, unconditional supporters of Israel for decades” had told him that “images of mass starvation” in Gaza would cost Israel their support.
‘More of a threat’
Even if the US won’t use its leverage to force Israel to change its strategy in Gaza in a more significant way, it doesn’t mean Europe can’t put pressure on Israel on its own, experts say.
The European Union is Israel’s biggest trading partner, accounting for roughly a third of its trade in goods.
A full suspension of the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel is unlikely, as it would require unanimous agreement of all 27 EU member states and several have already indicated they would not support it – including Hungary, a staunch supporter of Israel.
Reich said that under the terms of the agreement, both the EU and Israel can terminate it for whatever reason, or even without giving a reason.
“The thing is that within the EU, that would require consensus … and that would be very, very hard, because there are many countries, many (EU) member states that will not go along with this,” he said.
“So I think it’s more of a threat to put pressure (on Israel) and maybe they could manage some temporary suspension of some provisions, but to terminate it, I don’t think it can happen,” he added.
Public support for the country runs deep in many of the bloc’s member states, which makes it difficult for some European governments to push for harsher sanctions against Israel.
And, Lovatt said, many European countries are also aware of the fact that they may need Israel’s help in the future.
“Especially in a situation where European countries are increasingly fearful of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but also the threat that Russia represents the rest of Europe, and (they) see Israel as an important source of weapons and technology,” he said.
While terminating the association agreement would require unanimity, it would only take a majority of EU states to force through a partial suspension of the agreement.
Even that could be painful for Israel because it could lead to higher tariffs on Israeli products or prevent Israel from taking part in coveted EU projects such as the Horizon Europe program, with more than $100 billion in funding available for research and innovation.
The EU has in the past used its power to put pressure on countries over human rights abuses – often for issues Lovatt says are a lot less serious than the current situation in Gaza.
“The bottom line is that until now, the EU has treated Israel with a degree of exceptionalism by not taking anywhere near the sort of steps that it has taken in other situations of human rights abuses or territorial annexation,” Lovatt said.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot and killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested in Washington, DC, Wednesday night, authorities said.
The slain staffers, who the Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs named as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were a couple who officials say were soon to be engaged.
The two were attending an event for young professionals at the Capital Jewish Museum hosted by the American Jewish Committee. At around 9 p.m. outside the museum, they were approached by a gunman who opened fire and killed them, officials said.
The suspect, whom DC police identified as 31-year-old Chicago native Elias Rodriguez, pretended to be a bystander after the shooting, an eyewitness told CNN.
When police arrived, the man turned himself in and shouted “Free, Free Palestine” while being handcuffed. He is currently in custody, according to authorities. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said the man “implied that he committed the offense.”
The shooting, which took place in the heart of the Hill, has shaken the Jewish community at a time of heightened global tensions, as US-led attempts to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas remain unsuccessful and fighting in Gaza continues.
Tensions are also high across US college campuses where hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters have been arrested amid polarized debates over the right to protest Israel’s military actions and accusations of antisemitism.
“We’ll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight our Jewish community,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters late Wednesday.
“These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA,” President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims.
Rodriguez is being interviewed by the DC Metropolitan Police and FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X.
“Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,” Bongino said.
Ted Deutch, the CEO of the AJC, described the shooting “an unspeaking act of violence.”
“At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families,” he said.
Suspect was seen ‘pacing’ outside museum before shooting
Police Chief Smith said Rodriguez was allegedly seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before approaching a group of four and shooting two of them with a handgun.
The 31-year-old later retreated inside the museum, where he was eventually detained, according to Smith.
According to Sara Marinuzzi, an eyewitness who spoke with CNN, the suspect “pretended to be a witness” once inside the building and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming responsibility for the attack.
Another witness, Paige Siegel, told CNN she heard Rodriguez say, “I did it for Gaza,” and “Free Palestine.”
Rodriguez, who was taken into custody on Wednesday night told officers, “I did this,” according to eyewitness Yoni Kalin.
Kalin was at the museum attending the same event organized by the AJC when he heard shots rang out. “At first I didn’t recognize them as gunshots,” he told CNN over the phone.
Moments later, a man entered the museum appearing to be a witness, according to Kalin. He recalled the man sitting in the museum but not interacting with many people present at the event. Ten minutes later, when police entered the building, the man appeared to confess to shooting, telling officers, “I did this, I did this for Palestine,” according to Kalin.
“It’s horrible,” Kalin said. “I just didn’t realize he was the perpetrator.”
Kalin added that between the shooting and the arrest, Rodriguez appeared shaken up. People approached the suspect to offer him water and check if he was okay, he said.
Kalin said around 50 people attended the event, which was organized to discuss how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions such as Gaza. He added that over 30 staffers from various embassies attended the event.
“I’m still in shock,” Kalin told CNN. “I just hope we learn from this and just recognize that violence and terrorism doesn’t get us where we need to be” he added.
The couple ‘were in the prime of their lives’
When officers arrived on the scene minutes after the shooting, they found “one adult male and one adult female unconscious and not breathing,” Smith told reporters late Wednesday. “Both victims succumbed to their injuries,” she said.
“We are shocked and horrified this morning by the news of the brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of two of our Embassy staff members in Washington,” the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a post on X in the early hours of Thursday.
“We embrace the grieving families during this painful time and will continue to support them always,” the post read.
“Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives,” Yechiel Leiter, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, also said in a social media post Thursday. “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.” Leiter earlier shared with reporters that the couple was about to be engaged.
“A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple,” he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, expressed his condolences to the families of the young couple.
“My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer,” Netanyahu said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/middleeast/gaza-aid-trickles-un-not-enough-intl,Aid trickles into Gaza for first time in weeks as UN says it’s ‘nowhere near enough’,2025-05-22 12:08:53,"A limited amount of food was delivered to desperate Gazans for the first time since early March on Wednesday, but senior United Nations officials warned the supply was “nowhere near enough” to forestall the worsening humanitarian crisis.
UN officials say they are hoping for more to be delivered on Thursday.
Aid agencies warn that much of Gaza will be on the verge of famine if supplies are not allowed into the enclave in volume.
Until this week, Israel had forbidden all humanitarian aid entering Gaza since March 2, saying Hamas was stealing and profiting from it.
Tom Fletcher, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, posted on X Thursday: “In close touch with team in #Gaza. Today will be crucial. Truckloads of lifesaving aid finally on move again.”
Trucks loaded with humanitarian aid began delivering the first food and supplies in Gaza in more than 11 weeks on Wednesday. More than 90 trucks carrying flour, baby supplements and other food began dispersing aid into southern Gaza, according to the head of Gaza’s transport association Nahid Shuheiber.
Kamel Ajour, the owner of the Ajour bakeries in Gaza, said some of the flour would be distributed to bakeries in the south to start working “immediately.”
Shuhaiber said he hoped for a similar number of trucks Thursday but said two trucks had been stolen by desperately hungry residents on Wednesday.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said late Wednesday that five kitchens had resumed operations in Khan Younis and Gaza City, but five others had been forced to close for a lack of supplies.
According to COGAT, the Israeli agency handling the passage of aid into Gaza, five trucks entered Gaza on Monday, 93 trucks entered on Tuesday, and another 100 entered on Wednesday.
But the head of the UN Children’s Fund, Catherine Russell, said on X Wednesday: “The few trucks that have entered with life-saving supplies are nowhere near sufficient and have yet to reach those in desperate need. We’re running out of supplies inside Gaza, and we’re running out of time.”
There have also been delays caused by disagreements between the Israeli military and aid agencies over the routes to be used within Gaza.
“Israeli authorities had only allowed our teams to go through one area where that was highly congested, that we felt was insecure and where we felt looting was highly likely to take place given the prolonged deprivation in Gaza,” said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, on Wednesday.
OCHA also said Wednesday that “critical items such as hygiene products or fuel have not been allowed by the Israeli authorities.”
Israel has endorsed a plan promoted by the US ambassador in Jerusalem, Mike Huckabee, for distribution of aid to be organized by a private group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. UN officials have said the plan is inadequate.
As aid begins to trickle into Gaza, Israeli forces continue to expand their operations, pushing the civilian population into a smaller area. OCHA said that “large numbers of people continue to be displaced,” with 80 per cent of Gaza now either subject to displacement orders or located in Israeli-militarized zones.
“The ongoing displacement of Gaza’s population is putting immense pressure on humanitarian teams,” OCHA said, leading to “an extreme lack of shelter space. Displacement sites and residential buildings are very overcrowded.”
UN agencies are also concerned about strikes on hospitals. It said that on Wednesday Al Awda hospital in northern Gaza – the only partially functional facility in the area – was struck, while Kamal Adwan Hospital ceased operations. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Thursday that the closure of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza had deprived more than 400,000 people of health services.
In southern Gaza, the European hospital remains out of service after several Israeli strikes last week.
The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had received one truck of medical supplies for its field hospital in Rafah but added that it would take time to recover from the deficit created over the past ten weeks.
“The coming days are critical,” the ICRC said.
Another issue is water, with the largest desalination plant in the north of Gaza located in an area which civilians have been told to leave. Many people have moved to Al-Mawasi, a coastal area in the south, but it is not connected to the water network and relies heavily on water trucking.
Gaza City spokesman Asem Alnabih told CNN there is a “major water crisis due to the reduction in fuel supplies,” with the situation aggravated by displacement and rising temperatures.",['Tim Lister'],en

⁠“We have eliminated tens of thousands of terrorists,” said Netanyahu at a press conference on Wednesday evening. “We eliminated the leaders of the murderers Deif, Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and probably Mohammad Sinwar.”
Israel targeted Sinwar in a massive set of strikes on the European hospital in Khan Younis last week. The attack killed 28 Palestinians and wounded more than 50 others, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said after the strike.
If Sinwar’s death is confirmed, it would be the latest in a string of assassinations that have dealt a serious blow to the group’s top brass but are yet to break its grip on power.
Sinwar is the brother of former leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by the Israeli military in southern Gaza in October.
CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment.
In his first press conference in months, Netanyahu also vowed that Israel would not stop its newly launched military operation in Gaza.
“Our forces are capturing more and more territory in Gaza,” he said. “At the end of the operation all areas of the Strip will be under Israeli security control.”
Netanyahu said that Israel could agree to a temporary ceasefire that includes the release of hostages, but an end to the war would only come with a list of conditions, including the demilitarization of Gaza, the overthrow of Hamas, and the implementation of the US plan for voluntary emigration from the besieged enclave.
“Gaza will be completely demilitarized, and we will carry out the Trump plan, which is so correct and so revolutionary, and it says something simple: The residents of Gaza who wish to leave – will be able to leave,” he said.
“Anyone who calls on us to stop the war before these goals are achieved is calling on us to leave Hamas in power,” Netanyahu said.
In February, Trump put forward a proposal for the United States to “take over” Gaza, relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries, and redevelop the war-torn enclave into what he described as the “Riviera of the Middle East.”
The proposal was a stunning break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, and sent shockwaves through the region.
Netanyahu also said there is “full coordination” with the United States on Iran as the Trump administration pursues a new nuclear deal with Tehran. He said any deal would have to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and stop the enrichment of uranium. CNN reported on Tuesday that US intelligence suggests Israel is preparing a possible strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
“The state of Israel maintains the right to defend itself against a regime that threatens to destroy it,” said Netanyahu.","['Oren Liebermann', 'Tim Lister', 'Lauren Izso']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/21/middleeast/diplomats-israeli-fire-west-bank-intl,"Foreign diplomats come under Israeli fire on official West Bank visit, drawing swift international condemnation",2025-05-21 14:47:56,"The Israeli military fired warning shots at a large delegation of European and Arab diplomats on an official visit near the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, drawing swift international condemnation.
Delegations from more than 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Canada and others, were on an official mission to see the humanitarian situation around the besieged camp, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which called the incident a “deliberate and unlawful act.”
Video from the incident shows Israeli soldiers firing toward the delegation as it backs away from a gate blocking the road. At least seven shots can be heard in the video. One member of the delegation cautions the group, “be close to the wall, be close to the wall,” as they walk away from the scene.
“The ministry holds the Israeli occupying government fully and directly responsible for this criminal assault and affirms that such acts will not pass without accountability,” the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the visit to the camp - the site of a major ongoing military operation that has destroyed more than 100 buildings and impacted thousands of families - was coordinated in advance. The military said it launched an initial investigation once it became clear that the group was a diplomatic delegation.
“The delegation deviated from the approved route and entered an area where they were not authorized to be,” the military said in a statement Wednesday.
“IDF soldiers operating in the area fired warning shots to distance them away.”
The IDF said it will reach out to the delegations about the findings of the initial inquiry and “regrets the inconvenience caused.”
The Palestinian Authority said the visit was announced 10 days in advance and that the group had been at the gate for more than 15 minutes before Israeli soldiers started shooting.
Roland Friedrich, the director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in the West Bank, refuted the Israeli military’s version of events, saying that its explanations “do not fully capture the severity of today’s event.”
“This incident is a stark reminder of the lax use of excessive force routinely deployed by Israeli security forces in the West Bank, often with lethal consequences,” Friedrich said. “This raises serious concerns over the way rules of engagement are applied to unarmed civilians.”
Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said after the incident that “any threats on diplomats’ lives are unacceptable.”
“We definitely call on Israel to investigate this incident and also hold those accountable who are responsible for this,” Kallas said at a press conference Wednesday.
Italy’s foreign ministry summoned Israel’s ambassador in Rome for an official clarification.
“The threats against diplomats are unacceptable,” the country’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani added in a social media post on X.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said that Israel’s ambassador to France would also be summoned following the incident, calling it “unacceptable,” while Spain’s Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said that his government summoned the head of the Israeli embassy in Madrid.
Canada’s Foreign Minister Anita Anand confirmed on social media that four Canadian personnel were part of the delegation that was shot at, adding that she has asked officials to summon Israel’s Ambassador to convey “Canada’s serious concerns.”
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told a news conference in Ottawa that Canada expected a full and immediate explanation of what happened.
“It’s totally unacceptable,” he said. “It’s some of many things that are totally unacceptable that’s going on in the region.”
On Wednesday evening, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told CNN’s Isa Soares that her country will be summoning the Israeli ambassador to Finland in response to the military’s actions.
“Any deviation of any route – it is not an excuse,” Valtonen said. “It is prohibited to open fire against civilians, even under the laws of war. And, of course, these people were also under diplomatic protection.”
A host of officials from other European nations condemned the shooting, including representatives from Ireland, Belgium, Slovenia, Portugal, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom.
Foreign ministries from countries including Jordan, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar also strongly condemned the incident.
“This attack, which endangered the lives of diplomats, is yet another demonstration of Israel’s systematic disregard for international law and human rights,” Turkey’s foreign ministry said.
“The targeting of diplomats constitutes a grave threat not only to individual safety but also to the mutual respect and trust that form the foundation of inter-state relations. This attack must be investigated without delay, and those responsible must be held accountable,” it added.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-west-bank-international-pressure-intl,"UK pauses trade talks and EU reviews relationship agreement with Israel, as pressure grows on Netanyahu to halt Gaza siege",2025-05-20 14:14:15,"International pressure is mounting on Israel amid its renewed military operation in the Gaza Strip, as both the United Kingdom and the European Union announced measures distancing themselves from the country on Tuesday.
The UK paused trade negotiations with Israel and sanctioned West Bank settlers, as Britain’s top diplomat slammed Israel’s operation in Gaza as “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.”
Meanwhile, the EU announced that it would review its relationship with Israel, with the bloc’s foreign policy chief calling the situation on the ground in Gaza “catastrophic.”
The announcements come a day after the UK, France and Canada threatened to take “concrete actions,” including targeted sanctions, if Israel does not halt its fresh offensive and continues to block aid from entering Gaza. On Tuesday, however, the Israeli military vowed to “expand” its operations in the enclave.
Since May 5, Israel has been conducting a new offensive in Gaza, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying on Monday that his country plans to “take control of the entire Gaza Strip.” Hundreds have been killed and an Israeli blockade has meant that no aid entered the strip for 11 weeks until Monday, when five trucks were allowed in – a tiny fraction of the 500 trucks that authorities say are required each day to sustain the population.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the humanitarian situation in Gaza “intolerable” on Tuesday, stressing that aid needs to enter the strip “at pace.”
“The current situation in which we are seeing the bombardment, including of children, and the prospect of starvation, is just intolerable,” Starmer said, adding that “we are coordinating with our allies on this.”
Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong joined international calls for a “full and immediate resumption of aid to Gaza,” according to a statement on Wednesday.
“We condemn the abhorrent and outrageous comments made by members of the Netanyahu government about these people in crisis,” Wong said. “We have consistently opposed the expansion of military operations by Israel in Gaza, just as we have been clear that forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza would breach international law.”
Pope Leo XIV on Wednesday also called for Israel to permit aid to enter Gaza, describing the situation in the enclave as “increasingly worrying and painful,” as he held the first general audience of his papacy.
“I renew my heartfelt appeal to allow the entry of (some) decent humanitarian aid and bring an end to the hostilities, the heartbreaking price of which is being paid by children, the elderly and the sick,” the pontiff said in St. Peter’s Square.
‘A dark new phase’ in Gaza conflict
Speaking to lawmakers on Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy stressed that the UK backed Israel’s right to defend itself after the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, but said the conflict was “entering a dark new phase.”
“For 11 weeks Israeli forces have blockaded Gaza, leaving the World Food Programme without any – any – remaining stocks,” he said. “We are now entering a dark new phase in this conflict. Netanyahu’s government is planning to drive Gazans from their homes into a corner of the strip to the south and permit them a fraction of the aid that they need.”
Israel’s ambassador to the UK, Tzipura Hotovely, was summoned over the Israeli offensive in Gaza, as well as Israeli settler violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, the British Foreign Office said in a statement.
Settlers are Jewish Israelis who live in the Israeli-occupied territories, mostly in communities built by the Israeli government. Since Hamas’ October 7 attack, settlers have accelerated land grabs in the West Bank with support from the state.
“Settlement approval has accelerated while settler violence has soared,” Lammy told lawmakers Tuesday, announcing fresh sanctions on three individuals and four entities involved in the settler movement, in addition to a round of sanctions last fall.
Lammy added: “We will continue to act against those who are carrying out heinous abuses of human rights.”
Israel’s foreign ministry called the sanctions against the settlers “puzzling, unjustified, and particularly regrettable,” adding that “external pressure will not divert Israel from its path in the fight for its existence and security against enemies seeking its destruction.”
“If, due to anti-Israel obsession and internal political considerations, the British government is willing to harm its own economy — that is its decision,” it said on the UK’s pausing of the trade negotiations.
Shortly after the UK’s announcement, Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, announced that the bloc would review its association agreement with Israel due to its blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The EU-Israel Association Agreement covers various forms of cooperation between the two parties, including political dialogue, the free movement of goods, and scientific collaboration.
Article two of the document outlines that “relations between the parties … shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles.”
A “strong majority” of EU members voted in favor of a review of article two in the agreement with Israel, Kallas said.
“So, we will launch this exercise,” she said. “In the meantime, it is up to Israel to unblock the humanitarian aid.”
Israel slammed Kallas’ statement, saying it indicates a “misunderstanding of the complex reality Israel is facing.” The foreign ministry accused the EU of “ignoring” an American-backed initiative to send aid to Gaza without it reaching Hamas, and Israel’s decision to facilitate the entry of some aid into the enclave.
“We call on the EU to exert pressure where it belongs — on Hamas,” the Israeli foreign ministry posted to X.
Hundreds of thousands facing starvation
On top of the ongoing military offensive in Gaza, Israel’s monthslong blockade of aid has left one in five people in the enclave facing starvation as the entire territory edges closer to famine, according to the United Nations.
Israel has said that the blockade, along with its new military campaign, is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages held in the strip. But many international organizations have accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.
Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office, told CNN on Tuesday that is it is “imperative to get supplies into Gaza to save an estimated 14,000 babies likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition.”
The Israeli military announced Sunday it would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza as it launched its new major offensive in the strip. The reason, the military said, was the fact that a “starvation crisis” in Gaza would “jeopardize the operation.”
Netanyahu also suggested on Monday that Israel is allowing small amounts of food into the enclave to maintain the support of its international allies.
The Israeli prime minister said that “even our closest allies in the world – US senators I know personally” had told him that they support Israel’s war against Hamas, but “cannot accept… images of mass starvation.”
“We (are) approaching a dangerous point we don’t want to reach,” Netanyahu added.
The leader of Israel’s left-wing Democrats party, retired Israeli general Yair Golan, warned on Tuesday that Israel is “on its way to becoming a pariah state” because of its actions in Gaza.
“A sane country does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself a goal of expelling a population,” he told Israel’s public news channel Kan News. Netanyahu called Golan’s claim an “outrageous incitement against our heroic soldiers and against the State of Israel.”
On Tuesday, the Israeli military’s Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir vowed that Israel would “expand the maneuver” and “occupy additional territories” in Gaza until Hamas is defeated.
“The IDF operates at all times in accordance with IDF values, the law and international law, while uncompromisingly safeguarding the security of the state of Israel and its citizens. Any statement that casts doubt on the value of our actions and the morality of our fighters is baseless,” Zamir said.
On Monday, five aid trucks entered Gaza, according to the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into the region, a number that French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called “totally insufficient.”
On Tuesday, Israel gave its approval for the UN to send “around 100” trucks into the enclave, according to Laerke.
Laerke said that he hoped that many, if not all, of the aid trucks could cross to a point into Gaza on Tuesday.
“We need to get the supplies in as soon as possible, ideally within the next 48 hours. We will try to reach as many as we can in the days ahead – and are prioritizing baby food on first convoys,” he said.
COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza, said that 93 UN trucks had crossed into Gaza by Tuesday evening. These trucks carried flour, baby food, and medicine into the strip, according to UN Secretary-General spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.
Though the aid is now in the enclave, it has not yet been distributed, Dujarric said. Israeli security forces have ordered that the trucks need to be unloaded and reloaded before being given permission to be handed over to teams inside Gaza, he explained.
“So just to make it clear, while more supplies have come into the Gaza Strip, we have not been able to secure the arrival of those supplies into our warehouses and delivery points,” Dujarric said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/21/politics/israel-gaza-negotiations-trump-administration,"US negotiating Israel-Gaza ceasefire with Hamas through American in Doha, source says",2025-05-21 08:00:51,"The US has been talking with Hamas through an American intermediary in Doha this week in hopes of brokering an Israel-Gaza ceasefire agreement, according to a source familiar with the matter, as US officials say President Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with Israel’s handling of the conflict.
The talks have been led on the US side by Bishara Bahbah, the American-Palestinian who led the group “Arab Americans for Trump” during the 2024 presidential campaign and who has been working on behalf of the administration, the source said.
Bahbah remotely exchanged messages with Hamas earlier this year in what became a critical backchannel to secure Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, the source said.
Israel also began indirect talks with Hamas in the Qatari capital on Saturday, and working level dialogue continues. But bolstering the line between the Trump administration and Hamas could give US officials a clearer sense of Hamas’s position, particularly as Trump’s frustrations have mounted. In the past, the US has gone through Qatar and Egypt to correspond with Hamas.
“It tells me that they think they have a real negotiation happening. They want their own Hamas channel, not through Qatar or Egypt. That is an indicator that they think they can cut through the issues more effectively and also that they think they can influence Hamas,” said Dennis Ross, a former US envoy to the Middle East who is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
But some other regional experts are skeptical that this channel could lead to a breakthrough, given that Bahbah has limited experience and the Hamas decision makers are based in Gaza. But they argue it underscores that Trump is willing to work around Israel.
“I am not sure if this is a sign of desperation or confusion,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Maybe they see him as a window into Hamas thinking, it is certainly plausible.”
The growing frustrations among Trump and his top aides with Israel boil down to a key issue: the president wants the war to end – and soon. Trump, multiple sources familiar with the matter said, has been “annoyed” on several occasions with the pace of talks.
And Netanyahu, they fear, is not ready to deal.
“The president obviously wants a deal,” a person close to Trump told CNN. “It’s becoming more clear as talks continue that Bibi isn’t quite there.”
With Israel launching renewed strikes in Gaza, Vice President JD Vance opted not to visit the country over the weekend following his trip to Italy – a decision sources said was driven in part by logistics, and in part because his presence could have been viewed as a dramatic endorsement of the attacks.
“It would be hard to view the US as truly independent if he had gone,” the official added, calling it “an overly generous signal of support for what Israel is doing.”
Axios first reported on Trump’s frustrations and the reasoning behind Vance’s decision to skip a stop in Israel.
The sources cautioned that Trump’s frustrations do not amount to a change in posture in the United States’ support of Israel, a country which the president continues to view as one of America’s strongest allies. Nor is Trump privately pressuring Israel to halt its renewed military operation in the Gaza strip, said a source familiar with the matter.
National Security Council Spokesman Max Bluestein argued in a statement to CNN that it “is absolutely false” that the administration is frustrated with Israel.
“Israel has had no better friend than President Trump. We continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure that remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and that every opportunity for regional economic prosperity – especially the expansion of the Abraham Accords – is exploited. As Secretary [Marco] Rubio explained over the weekend, ‘What the President is saying is he doesn’t want to end the war until Hamas is defeated,’” Bluestein said.
Trump has shown a willingness to approach US foreign policy moves without direct adherence to Israel in recent months, including the announcement of a ceasefire with the Houthis – that did not include strikes on Israel and continued Iran deal talks while Israel has pushed for strikes on Iran’s nuclear program.
“There is a litany of actions lately reflecting that Trump will do what he thinks is in the US interest and Israeli considerations aren’t foremost in his mind. It’s not reflecting a break necessarily with Israel but it’s an effort to put energy into US interests,” Ross said.
Keeping US interests front and center – especially efforts that Trump wants to pursue in the region more broadly – the administration remains focused on trying to secure a Gaza ceasefire.
Bahbah has been coordinating his efforts with Steve Witkoff, the president’s Middle East envoy who has also been directly in touch with Netanyahu and his aides. Witkoff recently put forward a new proposal to both Israel and Hamas that could serve as the foundation to getting both sides to agree to another ceasefire, Trump administration officials said.
One of the officials said that the US wants humanitarian aid to continue flowing into Gaza, something the Israelis acquiesced to on Sunday after blocking aid into the strip for nearly 11 weeks.
Israel “can achieve their objective of defeating Hamas while still allowing aid to enter in sufficient quantities,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday.
“You have this acute, immediate challenge of food and aid not reaching people, and you have existing distribution systems that could get them there,” Rubio told the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Asked if it is an emergency humanitarian situation, Rubio conceded it is.
“Ultimately, I think we all see the same images,” he said.
The Trump administration was also pleased with how the talks with Hamas to release Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, unfolded in recent weeks. Instead of shutting down the channel between Hamas and Bahbah, they elevated it, signing off on in-person talks in Doha.
“His release was widely viewed internally as a goodwill gesture,” a White House official told CNN, adding that they saw the move as a key opportunity to draw Israel and Hamas back to the negotiating table.
But just days later, Israeli military forces moved into northern and southern Gaza as part of the “Gideon’s Chariots” operation, which Israel warned would take place if Hamas did not agree to a deal to release hostages. The fresh attacks did little to reassure US officials that a potential ceasefire deal was on the horizon.
But Trump’s frustrations with Netanyahu began even before the war took another deadly turn this week, the sources familiar with the matter said. One such instance was when the Israeli Prime Minister met privately with the president’s then-National Security Adviser, Michael Waltz, at the White House to discuss military options against Iran prior to a scheduled meeting in the Oval Office with Trump.
The meeting, first reported by the Washington Post, has been cited as a key point of Trump’s frustration with Waltz, who was later ousted from his position. But a source familiar with the matter said Trump also took issue with Netanyahu potentially trying to influence Waltz on a sensitive topic before raising it with Trump directly.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/politics/intelligence-israel-possible-strike-iran-nuclear-facilities,"New intelligence suggests Israel is preparing possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, US officials say",2025-05-20 22:01:48,"The US has obtained new intelligence suggesting that Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, even as the Trump administration has been pursuing a diplomatic deal with Tehran, multiple US officials familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN.
Such a strike would be a brazen break with President Donald Trump, US officials said. It could also risk tipping off a broader regional conflict in the Middle East — something the US has sought to avoid since the war in Gaza inflamed tensions beginning in 2023.
Officials caution it’s not clear that Israeli leaders have made a final decision, and that in fact, there is deep disagreement within the US government about the likelihood that Israel will ultimately act. Whether and how Israel strikes will likely depend on what it thinks of the US negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.
But “the chance of an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility has gone up significantly in recent months,” said another person familiar with US intelligence on the issue. “And the prospect of a Trump-negotiated US-Iran deal that doesn’t remove all of Iran’s uranium makes the chance of a strike more likely.”
The heightened worries stem not only from public and private messaging from senior Israeli officials that it is considering such a move, but also from intercepted Israeli communications and observations of Israeli military movements that could suggest an imminent strike, multiple sources familiar with the intelligence said.
Among the military preparations the US has observed are the movement of air munitions and the completion of an air exercise, two of the sources said.
But those same indicators could also simply be Israel trying to pressure Iran to abandon key tenets of its nuclear program by signaling the consequences if it doesn’t — underscoring the ever-shifting complexities the White House is navigating.
CNN has asked the National Security Council and the Israeli prime minister’s office for comment. The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not comment.
Trump has publicly threatened military action against Iran if his administration’s efforts to negotiate a new nuclear deal to limit or eliminate Tehran’s nuclear program fail. But Trump also set a limit on how long the US would engage in diplomatic efforts.
In a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in mid-March, Trump set a 60-day deadline for those efforts to succeed, according to a source familiar with the communication. It has now been more than 60 days since that letter was delivered, and 38 days since the first round ofv talks began.
A senior Western diplomat who met with the president earlier this month said that Trump communicated that the US would give those negotiations only weeks to succeed before resorting to military strikes. But for now, the White House policy is one of diplomacy.
That has put Israel “between a rock and a hard place,” said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official specializing in the region. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure both to avoid a US-Iran deal that Israel doesn’t view as satisfactory, while also not alienating Trump — who has already broken with the Israeli prime minister on key security issues in the region.
“At the end of the day, the Israeli decision-making is going to be predicated on US policy determinations and actions, and what agreements President Trump does or does not come to with Iran,” Panikoff said, who added that he did not believe Netanyahu would be willing to risk entirely fracturing the US relationship by launching a strike without at least tacit US approval.
Iran at its weakest in decades
Iran is in its weakest military position in decades, after Israel bombed its missile production facilities and air defenses in October, combined with an economy weakened by sanctions and Israel’s decimation of its most powerful regional proxies. Israel, US officials say, sees a window of opportunity.
The US is stepping up intelligence collection to be prepared to assist if Israeli leaders decide to strike, one senior US official told CNN. But a source familiar with the Trump administration’s thinking told CNN the US is unlikely to help Israel carry out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites at this moment, short of some major provocation by Tehran.
Israel does not have the capacity to destroy Iran’s nuclear program without American assistance, including midair refueling and the bombs required to penetrate the facilities deep underground, a need that is also reflected in previous US intelligence reports, according to a source familiar with the matter.
An Israeli source told CNN that Israel would be prepared to carry out military action on its own if the US were to negotiate what this source described as a “bad deal” with Iran that Israel cannot accept.
“I think it’s more likely they strike to try and get the deal to fall apart if they think Trump is going to settle for a ‘bad deal,’” said the other person familiar with US intelligence. “The Israelis have not been shy about signaling that to us … both publicly and privately.”
A US intelligence assessment from February suggested Israel could use either military aircraft or long-range missiles to capitalize on Iran’s degraded air defense capabilities, CNN previously reported.
But the same assessment also described how such strikes would only minimally set the Iranian nuclear program back and wouldn’t be a cure-all.
“It’s a real challenge for Netanyahu,” Panikoff said.
For now, the US talks with Iran are stuck on a demand that Tehran not enrich uranium, a process which can enable weaponization, but which is also necessary to produce nuclear power for civilian purposes.
Special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is leading the US delegation, told ABC News over the weekend that Washington “cannot allow even 1% of an enrichment capability” under an agreement. “We’ve delivered a proposal to the Iranians that we think addresses some of this without disrespecting them,” he said.
Khamenei said on Tuesday that he does not expect negotiations with the United States over Tehran’s nuclear program to “reach a conclusion,” calling the US demand that Iran not enrich uranium a “big mistake.” Iran insists it has a right to enrich under the United Nations’ Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and says it will not relinquish that right under any circumstances.
Another round of talks may take place in Europe this week, according to Witkoff. Both the US and Iran have put proposals on the table, but after more than a month of the talks facilitated by Oman, there is no current US proposal with Trump’s sign-off, sources said.
US intelligence agencies in February issued warnings that Israel will likely attempt to strike facilities key to Iran’s nuclear program this year, CNN previously reported.
It has “consistently been the Israeli position that the military option is the only option to stopping Iran’s military nuclear program,” one US official noted.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/19/middleeast/israel-pushes-deeper-into-gaza-what-we-know-intl,"UK, France, Canada threaten sanctions if Israel continues new offensive into Gaza. Here’s what we know",2025-05-19 14:28:40,"International pressure has been building on Israel over its new military offensive in Gaza that has left hundreds dead in just the last few days.
The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, and Canada threatened to take “concrete actions” on Monday, including targeted sanctions, if Israel does not stop its renewed military offensive and continues to block aid from entering Gaza.
Israel launched a new devastating ground offensive in Gaza over the weekend just as US President Donald Trump departed the region without sealing a ceasefire and hostage deal.
The Israeli military said its forces moved into northern and southern Gaza over the past day as part of the “Gideon’s Chariots” operation, which Israel warned would take place if Hamas doesn’t agree to a new hostage deal on its terms.
The ground operation came after days of heavy airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, which according to health authorities there have wiped out entire families.
Israel has said it will allow a “basic amount of food” into the besieged enclave, a move which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted was due to intense pressure from allies, and on Monday the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza said five trucks had entered the enclave. However, UN aid chief Tom Fletcher described the delivery as “limited” and a “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.”
The latest developments come after Hamas and Israel began indirect talks in the Qatari capital Doha on Saturday.
Here’s what we know about Israel’s new offensive and what it means for Gazans.
What is Israel’s new operation in Gaza?
Israel’s Security Cabinet approved the new military offensive in Gaza on May 5. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later said the aim of the operation was to achieve “all the goals of the war in Gaza,” including defeating Hamas and securing the release of remaining hostages in the territory.
On Monday, Netanyahu said that Israel plans to “take control of the entire Gaza Strip.”
The warring parties failed to reach a deal during Trump’s visit last week, and Israel pressed on with its operation over the weekend. This began with a series of intense airstrikes last week and was followed by an expanded ground offensive on Sunday.
The Israeli military said Sunday that over the past week, it struck more than 670 “Hamas targets” in a wave of preliminary airstrikes across the enclave.
Early Monday morning, Israeli forces struck the medical supplies warehouse of the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis neighborhood, damaging some of the medical supplies that had been provided to the center by Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), according to the UK-based organization.
On Tuesday, health officials in Gaza said that Israeli strikes killed at least 49 people across the enclave overnight.
On Monday, health officials said that Israel’s operation had killed at least 136 people in 24 hours, and shuttered the last functioning hospital in the enclave’s north. Entire families were killed while sleeping, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
More than 400 people have been killed and over 1,000 others injured since Thursday, according to a CNN count of health ministry data.
More than 53,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its war on October 7, 2023, according to the ministry, which added that the majority of the dead are women and children.
What’s happening with Gaza aid?
On Sunday, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said that due to the “operational need,” Israel will allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza to prevent famine in the enclave, which Israel says would jeopardize its military operation.
The United Nations acknowledged on Monday that several of its trucks were allowed in through the Kerem Shalom crossing but that much more aid was needed.
Earlier on Monday, Gaza’s Government Media Office said at least 500 aid trucks were needed daily to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Netanyahu has also hinted that his country could lose the support of its closest allies, including the United States, if it doesn’t lift its 11-week blockade on the territory, which has further exacerbated a humanitarian crisis on the ground that aid agencies have said could lead to widespread famine.
The UN had warned that Gaza’s entire population of over 2.1 million people is facing a risk of famine following 19 months of conflict and mass displacement.
The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, and Canada have called on the Israeli government to stop its military operations in Gaza and allow the entry of humanitarian aid.
“If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,” a joint statement from the leaders read.
Those actions could include targeted sanctions, they warned.
Netanyahu responded by accusing the leaders of “offering a huge prize” to the Hamas fighters who attacked Israel on October 7 and “inviting more such atrocities” to follow.
In a separate joint statement, foreign ministers from 23 countries, including France, Germany, Italy and the UK, and EU representatives urged Israel to allow “a full resumption” of aid into Gaza immediately and to enable the UN and humanitarian organizations “to work independently and impartially to save lives.”
“Whilst we acknowledge indications of a limited restart of aid, Israel blocked humanitarian aid entering Gaza for over two months. Food, medicines and essential supplies are exhausted. The population faces starvation. Gaza’s people must receive the aid they desperately need,” the joint statement Monday said.
On Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Israel’s easing of humanitarian aid access to Gaza is insufficient. “It is totally insufficient… Immediate and massive aid is needed,” Barrot told France Inter radio.
Earlier Monday, Netanyahu had conceded that if “a situation of famine” arose in Gaza, Israel “simply won’t receive international support.”
“Even our closest allies in the world – US senators I know personally and who have been staunch, unconditional supporters of Israel for decades – are coming to me and saying: ‘We are giving you all the support to achieve victory – weapons, support for your efforts to eliminate Hamas, protection at the UN Security Council – but there’s one thing we cannot accept: images of mass starvation… If that happens, we won’t be able to support you anymore,’” Netanyahu said in an address posted to Telegram.
Netanyahu’s explanations were largely aimed at mollifying his right-wing supporters who adamantly oppose the entry of any humanitarian aid to Gaza, including to civilians.
Asked when aid will start entering into the enclave, Netanyahu’s office said “it will happen in the near future.”
A controversial American-backed organization, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), tasked with delivering aid to the territory, welcomed the Israeli announcement about allowing food aid as a “bridging mechanism” until the group is fully operational.
The foundation is meant to run a new, tightly controlled mechanism for aid deliveries that has been approved by Israel and the US, which both countries say is designed to prevent Hamas from “stealing” aid.
Given that the initial sites would only be in southern and central Gaza, the UN warned, this could be seen to be encouraging Israel’s publicly stated goal of forcing “the entire Gazan population” out of northern Gaza, as Defense Minister Israel Katz put it earlier this month.
Jake Wood, the foundation’s executive director, said Israel has also agreed to allow it to establish two sites in northern Gaza, which he believes can be up and running within the first 30 days of its operations.
Wood told CNN that he did not yet know when or how many aid trucks Israel would allow into Gaza and said he believes much of the humanitarian community’s opposition to the mechanism is based on misinformation.
How have others reacted?
Rights advocates say the US and Israeli-backed plan would militarize aid, endanger civilian lives and encourage their forced displacement.
On Monday, the UN’s children’s agency’s top chief described the new GHF mechanism as “unworkable,” saying the scheme would “weaponize humanitarian aid for children and women.”
“Israel as the occupying power, has a legal responsibility actually to provide aid,” James Elder told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Connect the World. “Despite more aid workers being killed than any other conflict… brave people are ready to do that job. They need to be allowed to do it.”
It came after the UN’s aid chief, Tom Fletcher, insisted there’s no need for an alternative Gaza aid plan. “Let’s not waste time: We already have a plan,” he said on Friday.
In one of the strongest condemnations of Israel’s war by a high-ranking UN official, Fletcher said the international community must prevent “genocide” in the enclave. “Will you act – decisively – to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law? Or will you say instead, ‘we did all we could?’” he told the UN Security Council.
What is Trump saying?
Trump visited Gulf Arab states last week, including Qatar, where his negotiating team was engaged in ceasefire and hostage talks.
The president said this month that he wanted an end to the “brutal war” in Gaza and did not visit Israel during his tour of the region, which he had already twice bypassed this month in reaching bilateral deals with regional militant groups.
On Wednesday, Trump denied that Israel had been sidelined. “This is good for Israel,” he said. But on Thursday, he said he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone.”
He also told Fox News on Saturday that he is not frustrated with Netanyahu, as the Israeli prime minister has got “a tough situation.” While in the Gulf, Trump also acknowledged that people are starving in Gaza and said the US would have the situation “taken care of.”
On Sunday, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told ABC News that the issue with getting aid into Gaza is primarily logistical. “It is logistically complicated and the conditions on the ground are dangerous,” he said.
Where does this leave talks?
Israeli Defense Minister Katz said Saturday that the new military operation in Gaza is what pressured Hamas to return to negotiations in Qatar last week. But analysts and officials say it’s more likely that the militant group agreed to restart the talks following Trump’s Middle East visit.
Senior Hamas official Taher Al-Nunu confirmed Saturday that “negotiations without preconditions” had started in Doha, according to Hamas-run al Aqsa TV.
It is unclear how well the discussions are progressing in Doha. Israel on Sunday indicated its openness to ending the war in Gaza if Hamas surrenders, a proposition the group is unlikely to accept as long as Israel continues to insist on Hamas disarming.
Meanwhile, Hamas officials have given conflicting comments about the talks.
Earlier on Sunday, a senior Hamas leader told CNN that the group had agreed to release between seven and nine Israeli hostages in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 300 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
Hours later, another senior Hamas leader, Sami Abu Zuhri, denied and contradicted that proposal, posting a statement on Al-Aqsa TV’s Telegram: “There is no truth to the rumors regarding the movement’s agreement to release nine Israeli prisoners in exchange for a two-month ceasefire.”
Zuhri went on to say: “We are ready to release the prisoners all at once, provided the occupation commits to a cessation of hostilities under international guarantees, and we will not hand over the occupation’s prisoners as long as it insists on continuing its aggression against Gaza indefinitely.”","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Kara Fox']",en

The Israeli military’s ground operation in northern and southern Gaza comes as international mediators push for progress in ceasefire talks.
Hamas and Israel began indirect talks in the Qatari capital Doha Saturday, with senior Hamas official Taher Al-Nunu confirming that “negotiations without preconditions” had started, according to Hamas-run al Aqsa TV.
While there is some optimism around the talks, a breakthrough is looking uncertain. Israel on Sunday indicated its openness to ending the war in Gaza if Hamas surrenders, a proposition the militant group is unlikely to accept. Hamas has said it will release all of the Israeli hostages if there are guarantees Israel will end the war.
“If Hamas wants to talk about ending the war through Hamas’s surrender, we will be ready,” an Israeli source said.
Earlier on Sunday, a senior Hamas leader told CNN that the group had agreed to release between seven and nine Israeli hostages in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 300 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
Hours later another senior Hamas leader, Sami Abu Zuhri, denied and contradicted that proposal, posting a statement on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV Telegram: “There is no truth to the rumors regarding the movement’s agreement to release nine Israeli prisoners in exchange for a two-month ceasefire.”
He went on to say, “We are ready to release the prisoners all at once, provided the occupation commits to a cessation of hostilities under international guarantees, and we will not hand over the occupation’s prisoners as long as it insists on continuing its aggression against Gaza indefinitely.”
The Israeli military has claimed that their new military campaign – called “Gideon’s Chariots,” a reference to a biblical warrior, and announced late on Friday – has brought Hamas back to the negotiating table. And due to the “operational need,” Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office said Sunday that the country will allow a “basic amount of food” to enter the Gaza Strip, to prevent a hunger crisis in the enclave, which Israel says would jeopardize the operation.
The campaign was launched “to achieve all the goals of the war in Gaza, including the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.
“During the operation, we will increase and expand our operational control in the Gaza Strip, including segmenting the territory and moving the population for their protection in all the areas in which we operate,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Effie Defrin said on Sunday.
But analysts and officials say it’s more likely that Hamas agreed to restart the talks following a visit from US President Donald Trump to the Middle East.
“Following discussions between Qatar and the US during President Trump’s visit to Doha, there is a renewed push by mediators from the United States, Qatar and Egypt to see if a new ceasefire agreement can be reached,” an official with knowledge of the talks told CNN.
This past week, Netanyahu directed the Israeli negotiating team to head to Qatar for talks, but made clear that he is only committed to negotiating a proposal put forward by the US’ Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, which calls for the release of half the hostages in return for a temporary ceasefire. That proposal did not guarantee an end to the war.
Trump was in Doha Wednesday as part of a Middle East trip that skipped Israel. Trump said this month that he wanted an end to the “brutal war” in Gaza.
He also bypassed Israel twice this month in reaching bilateral deals with regional militant groups. Hamas released an Israeli-American hostage last week, and the Houthis agreed to stop firing at American ships in the Red Sea while pledging to continue fighting Israel.
Trump, however, denied that Israel had been sidelined. “This is good for Israel,” he said. But on Thursday, he said he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone.”
“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” Trump said from Qatar.
While in the Gulf, Trump also acknowledged that people are starving in Gaza and said the US would have the situation in Gaza “taken care of.”
Entire families killed
Meanwhile, the UN and prominent aid organizations are raising the alarm over Israel’s new offensive in Gaza, saying it is civilians who are bearing the brunt of the assault.
More than 300 people have been killed and over 1,000 others injured after Israel ramped up intense airstrikes since Thursday, according to a CNN count of this week’s Palestinian Ministry of Health data.
Entire families were killed while sleeping together, according to the health ministry.
In the Al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, an infant, his two young siblings and their parents, who were all living in a displacement camp, were killed on Saturday, Dr. Munir al-Barsh, the health ministry’s director, told CNN.
As the bombardment continues and the death toll rises, Gaza’s healthcare system is being pushed further to the brink.
Over the past week, the Israeli military has carried out strikes near several hospitals across the enclave, including the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, the last remaining functioning medical facility in northern Gaza, rendering it out of service.
Dr. Marwan Al-Sultan, the director of the hospital said Friday that there were “extremely intense explosions” around the hospital, which severed the connections to ventilators that some of their patients require to stay alive. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the strike - the IDF has previously accused Hamas of hiding in medical facilities.
On Sunday, Al-Sultan told British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) that the hospital is “completely besieged,” that nobody is able to reach it, and that its intensive care unit was also being hit.
“We are deeply helpless,” he said, adding that the situation is “beyond alarming.”
Northern Gaza’s Al-Awda hospital saw a “harrowing night” with bombing in the vicinity of the hospital, the facility’s director Dr. Mohammed Salha told MAP on Sunday.
Salha said the hospital’s medical systems – oxygen for ventilators, electricity and water supplies– were severely damaged. Quadcopters flying over the area hampered the movement of medical teams in and out of the hospital, and a shortage of medical supplies and fuel was making it difficult for the hospital to continue providing essential care.
On Sunday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said that “all public hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip are now out of service.”
Famine risk in Gaza
Prior to Israel announcing Sunday that it will allow a “basic amount of food” to enter the Gaza Strip, the UN warned the enclave’s entire population of over 2.1 million people is facing a risk of famine following 19 months of conflict and mass displacement, exacerbated by Israel’s 11-week blocking of aid.
A controversial American-backed organization, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), tasked with delivering aid to the enclave, welcomed the Israeli announcement about allowing food aid into Gaza as a “bridging mechanism” until the group is fully operational.
The non-profit was set up at the urging of the American government to help alleviate hunger in Gaza, while complying with Israeli demands that the aid not reach Hamas.
In a statement, the group’s executive director Jake Wood said, “Today’s announcement marks an important interim step. We expect GHF’s new aid mechanism—including the establishment of four initial Secure Distribution Sites—to be up and running before the end of the month.”
The new organization has come under criticism from top humanitarian officials, who warn that it is insufficient, could endanger civilians, and even encourage their forced displacement. The initial sites only being in southern and central Gaza could be seen as encouraging Israel’s publicly stated goal of forcing Gaza’s population out of the north, the UN warned.
But the foundation says it has asked Israel to help set up distribution points in the north. The UN also warned that the Israeli military’s involvement in securing the sites could discourage aid recipients.
Israel’s National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, called the Prime Minister’s Office’s aid decision a “serious mistake,” asserting that any aid entering Gaza would “certainly fuel Hamas.”
The number of people killed by Israel’s offensive in Gaza in the wake of the October 7, 2023 attacks now exceeds 53,000 – the majority of whom are women and children, the health ministry said Thursday.
Despite the resumption of talks in Qatar, Omar Qandil, whose brother, sister-in-law and 4-month-old niece were killed in an overnight airstrike in central Gaza, said he feels the world has turned a blind eye to their suffering.
“They were all asleep… all targeted in their bedroom,” he said.
“I don’t know what we (can) say anymore, we (have) spoke a lot. There is no one looking at us: not Arabs not Muslims, no one.”
The IDF on Sunday said its new offensive in Gaza is happening “in full coordination” with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, and that the military is trying to prevent harm to the remaining hostages; but the forum has decried the operation saying it would endanger those still held captive in the enclave.
“The current policy is killing the living and erasing the dead. Every bombing, every delay, every indecision increases the danger. The living hostages face immediate mortal danger, and we risk losing the deceased forever,” said Hagai Levine, the head of the forum’s health team, who the group said co-authored a report about the dangers the latest Israeli operation poses to the hostages.

At least 262 people have been killed and 675 others injured after Israel ramped up intense strikes since Thursday, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
“The situation for Palestinians in Gaza is beyond description, beyond atrocious & beyond inhumane,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a post on X Saturday.
“A policy of siege & starvation makes a mockery of international law. The blockade against humanitarian aid must end immediately. This is a moment for moral clarity & action,” Guterres added.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement late on Friday that it had launched “extensive attacks and mobilized forces to seize strategic areas in the Gaza Strip, as part of the opening moves of Operation ‘Gideon’s Chariots’ and the expansion of the campaign in Gaza, to achieve all the goals of the war in Gaza, including the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas.”
Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas resumed talks for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal in Qatar’s capital, Doha, on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been in close contact with the negotiation team in Doha, and has instructed the team to remain in Doha “to fully exhaust all efforts to secure the release of our hostages,” an Israeli official said Saturday.
The development comes as US President Donald Trump concluded his visit to the Middle East without securing a ceasefire deal and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that the population of Gaza would be displaced to the south following his security cabinet’s approval of an expanded military operation that one minister described as a plan to “conquer” the territory.
The IDF’s announcement also comes shortly after the Palestinian Ministry of Health marked a grim milestone in the war. On Thursday, the ministry said that the number of people killed by Israel’s offensive in Gaza in the wake of the October 7 attacks in 2023 now exceeds 53,000 – the majority of whom are women and children.
Dr. Munir Al-Sultan, Director of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, said Friday that there were “extremely intense explosions” around the hospital, which severed the connections to ventilators that some of their patients require to stay alive.
Raed Radwan, a displaced resident in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, told CNN Saturday that he could feel the ground shaking since dawn because of explosions in the enclave.
“Many people who were unable to flee yesterday due to the intensity of the shelling are now on the move,” he said.
“Following the announcement of the new military operation, food prices skyrocketed. Whatever goods remain in the markets or are being sold on the streets have become extremely expensive,” Radwan said adding that there is a “significant” movement of people from northern Gaza into the south with transportation costs surging dramatically.
“The situation in Gaza is heartbreaking, beyond imagination. It’s hard to describe,” said Nael Rahmi, from the Al-Nasr neighborhood in Gaza.
“People are fleeing with only the clothes on their backs, unable to carry any personal belongings.”
Differences with US
The new Israeli offensive comes amid what appear to be growing differences between the US and Israeli governments. Trump said last week that he wanted an end to the “brutal war” in Gaza and he did not visit Israel during his tour of the Middle East this week.
He also bypassed Israel twice this month in reaching bilateral deals with regional militant groups. Hamas released an Israeli-American hostage last week, and the Houthis agreed to stop firing at American ships in the Red Sea while pledging to continue fighting Israel.
On Wednesday, Trump denied that Israel had been sidelined. “This is good for Israel,” he said. But on Thursday, he said he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone.”
“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” Trump said in Qatar.
While in the Gulf, Trump also acknowledged that people are starving in Gaza and said the US would have the situation in Gaza “taken care of.”
“We’re looking at Gaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving,” he told reporters in Abu Dhabi.
Meanwhile, in the Iraqi capital on Saturday, Arab leaders gathered for a summit to address several pressing regional issues, including the war in Gaza. The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas attended the summit headed by Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.
In a joint statement, the leaders called for an immediate ceasefire in the enclave and urged the international community “to assume their moral and legal responsibilities to pressure for an end to the bloodshed and ensure the unhindered entry of urgent humanitarian aid to all areas in need in Gaza.”
They reiterated their position on forced migration, saying that any form of displacement or expulsion was “a grave violation of the principles of international law and international humanitarian law, a crime against humanity, and ethnic cleansing.”
The UN’s Guterres and Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also attended the Baghdad summit.
The offensive has raised concerns globally. President of the European Council António Costa called for the violence to stop on X while a German Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement that “a large-scale military offensive also entails the risk that the catastrophic humanitarian situation for the population in Gaza and the situation of the remaining hostages will continue to deteriorate and that the prospect of an urgently needed long-term ceasefire fades.”
Dire conditions in Gaza
As the situation for Palestinian civilians grows increasingly dire, UN agencies are calling for urgent action.
Around 436,000 people have been estimated to have been forcibly displaced since March, according to a report from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, when Israel launched a fresh ground campaign as part of its renewed assault on the enclave.
For nearly 11 weeks, Israel has imposed a complete siege on Gaza, denying entry of food, medical supplies and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory.
Israel says the blockade, along with the military’s expansion of its bombardment of Gaza, is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages held in the enclave – but international organizations say it violates international law, with many accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.
A UN study this week warned one in five people in the Gaza Strip are facing starvation and that the entire population of Gaza is at “high risk” of famine, the most severe type of hunger crisis.
The US and Israel are backing the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a tightly controlled mechanism for Gaza aid deliveries that seeks to supplant the traditional role of UN agencies in delivering aid to the enclave.
The foundation’s executive director, Jake Wood, told CNN Friday that Israel has agreed to allow some food into Gaza before a newly approved mechanism for aid deliveries is up and running later this month, but he did not yet know when or how many aid trucks Israel would allow in.
The Israeli government has not been swayed by a growing tide of international criticism over the blockade on aid reaching Gaza, now in its third month.
Netanyahu said earlier this week: “We are destroying more and more homes, they have nowhere to return to. The only inevitable outcome will be the desire of Gazans to emigrate outside of the Gaza Strip,” a goal that Trump had supported soon after coming into office.
Israel launched the war after Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups carried out a surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. This attack marked the deadliest terror attack in Israel’s history.

Jake Wood, the foundation’s executive director, said he did not yet know when or how many aid trucks Israel would allow into Gaza, but he called conditions there “clearly urgent” and said he expects “positive updates on that in the coming days.”
The Israeli government, which has blocked aid to Gaza for nearly 11 weeks, has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the matter.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will run a new, tightly controlled mechanism for Gaza aid deliveries that has been approved by Israel and the United States, which both countries say is designed to prevent Hamas from stealing aid.
The United Nations’ major aid organizations say, however, that there is no evidence of any significant diversion of aid in Gaza and are refusing to participate in the new aid mechanism, warning it risks displacing Palestinians and increasing the dangers they face.
The UN’s aid chief, Tom Fletcher, said Friday that time should not be wasted on an alternative Gaza aid plan, writing on X: “To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let’s not waste time: We already have a plan.”
In his first interview since launching the foundation, Wood addressed criticisms by the UN and other aid groups and urged them to reconsider.
“This plan is not perfect, but this plan will be feeding people by the end of the month, in a scenario where no one has allowed aid in over the course of the last 10 weeks,” Wood said.
“Ultimately, the community is going to face a choice. This is going to be the mechanism by which aid can be distributed in Gaza. Are you willing to participate? The answer is going to be, you know, pretty critical to whether or not this ramps up to sufficiently feed 2.2 million people in a very desperate situation.”
Without the support of the major UN agencies, Wood said it is “hard to say” whether his foundation will be able to distribute enough aid to feed Gaza’s population of 2.1 million. He said the foundation currently plans to provide 300 million meals in its first 90 days, which he acknowledged is “not sufficient.”
Wood said he believes much of the humanitarian community’s opposition to the new mechanism is based on misinformation, including what he says are false claims about the Israeli military providing direct security for aid distribution sites and biometric data being shared with the Israeli government.
“I cannot blame the humanitarian community for crying foul amid that misinformation. I would not have participated in a plan that did those same things. However, that is not the plan,” Wood said.
He added that he “unequivocally … will not be a part of anything that forcibly dislocates or displaces the Palestinian population.”
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will initially launch four distribution sites: three in southern Gaza and one in central Gaza, Wood said – even though much of the strip’s population is in the central and northern areas.
The UN has previously warned that focusing on these locations could be seen as encouraging Israel’s publicly stated goal of forcing “the entire Gazan population” out of northern Gaza, as Defense Minister Israel Katz put it earlier this month.
According to Wood, Israel has also agreed to allow the foundation to establish two sites in northern Gaza, which he believes can be operational within the first 30 days of the foundation’s operations.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is only expected to be able to feed about 60% of Gaza’s population in its first weeks. Wood said it is not clear how long it will take to be able to cover the needs of the entire population.
Pressed on Israel’s claims that Hamas is stealing humanitarian aid – which Hamas and aid organizations deny – Wood said “it doesn’t really matter.”
“Israel controls access to Gaza, and if, if it is their belief that there is a large percentage of aid that is being interdicted by Hamas and other non-state actors … then we have no choice but to create a mechanism which operates in that construct and in that framing,” Wood said.
“I think, as with most situations, there’s three sides to every story. There’s one side, there’s the other side, and then there’s the truth somewhere in between. I’m not here to render judgment on either of those. I’m here to solve a problem and feed people.”
The foundation’s operations will be secured by a private American security contractor, UG Solutions, which also manned a vehicle checkpoint in Gaza during the ceasefire earlier this year.
Wood, a US Marine Corps veteran, said the contractors will be responsible for guarding aid trucks from the Gaza border to the distribution sites and will not be involved in distributing the aid to civilians.
Wood said they would be operating “under strict rules of engagement,” which he declined to share for operational security, but said they would abide by international laws and norms.",['Jeremy Diamond'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/middleeast/israeli-syrian-official-hold-rare-direct-talks-intl,"Israeli and Syrian official hold rare direct talks, Israeli source says",2025-05-16 14:24:33,"Israel and the new Syrian regime have recently held direct talks, according to an Israeli source familiar with the matter – an indication of shifting dynamics between the former enemies as Israel expands its military presence in the country.
The talks were held in Azerbaijan and were attended by the chief of the Israeli military’s Operations Directorate, Maj. Gen. Oded Basyuk, the source said, adding that Basyuk met with Syrian government representatives in the presence of Turkish officials.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would not confirm or deny that the talks in Azerbaijan took place, but did say that there have not been any direct talks between IDF officials and representatives of the Syrian government.
CNN has reached out to the Turkish government for comment.
Interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa said last week that his government was holding indirect talks with Israel to bring an end to its attacks on his country “so matters don’t reach a point where both sides lose control.”
There’s been no word from Damascus on any direct talks with Israel.
The source did not disclose the topics of the meeting, nor who was mediating. Channel 12 in Israel was the first to report the meeting.
This week, US President Donald Trump met Sharaa – a former jihadist who was designated a terrorist by the US in 2013 – in Saudi Arabia. Trump pledged to remove crippling sanctions imposed against the regime of Bashar al Assad. Assad was overthrown in an uprising led by Sharaa and fled Syria in December.
The White House said that Trump urged Sharaa take a series of measures, including normalization with Israel, expelling foreign and Palestinian “terrorists,” and helping the US to prevent the resurgence of ISIS.
Since the Assad regime fell, Israel has taken more territory in Syria and staged multiple attacks that it says are aimed at preventing the reconstitution of military capabilities and rooting out militancy that could threaten its security. Israel’s move into Syrian territory was initially described as temporary but officials have since said that the military will remain indefinitely.
Israel has also declared a buffer zone in the south of Syria with the stated aim of protecting Syria’s Druze minority. It also occupies the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1967 war and later annexed.
Prospect of sanctions returning every six months
The US Treasury said Thursday it was working to Trump’s direction on Syria sanctions and aims to implement “the necessary authorizations that would be critical to bringing new investment into Syria.”
It added in a post on X that the “Treasury’s actions can help rebuild Syria’s economy, financial sector, and infrastructure and could put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future.”
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified that the US will issue waivers to Syria sanctions and is not fully repealing them for the time being.
“As we make progress, hopefully we’ll be in a position soon, or one day, to go to Congress and ask them to permanently remove the sanctions,” Rubio said in Antalya, Turkey, adding that the Trump administration hoped to eventually repeal the waivers because the prospect of sanctions returning every six months is a deterrent to investment.","['Lauren Izso', 'Tim Lister']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/middleeast/israel-targets-hamas-leader-mohammed-sinwar-hospital-strike-gaza-intl,"Israel targets Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar in hospital strike in Gaza, sources say",2025-05-13 16:41:01,"Israel has targeted Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar in a strike on a hospital in southern Gaza on Tuesday evening, according to a senior Israeli official and two sources familiar with the matter.
He became the militant group’s de facto leader after the Israeli military killed his brother, Yahya Sinwar, last October.
Tuesday’s strike killed 28 Palestinians and injured more than 50, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which does not differentiate between military and civilian casualties.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a strike on the European hospital in Khan Younis, targeting “Hamas terrorists in a command and control center” in underground infrastructure beneath the hospital. The IDF did not identify the target of the strike.
Multiple airstrikes hit the yard of the hospital, according to Dr. Saleh Al Hams, the head of nursing. Some people are buried under the rubble, he said, calling it “a catastrophe.” Medical teams tried to move patients to safe units inside the hospital.
Video from the scene showed towering pillars of smoke and dust from what appeared to be some of the largest strikes in Gaza in recent weeks.
A woman whose mother was being treated for lung cancer at the European hospital told the UK-based aid organization Medical Aid for Palestinians at the time of the strikes.
“Explosions came from every direction, smoke, fire, rubble, sand everywhere. My mother collapsed on the floor. Shrapnel was flying all around us…The terror was beyond words. We hardly escaped death,” she said.
Marwan al-Hams, Director General of Field Hospitals at the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said the strikes had targeted the hospital’s inner courtyard and damaged sewage and water networks.
Marwan added that ambulances were unable to reach the emergency department, and a bulldozer brought in to clear rubble had been hit in another strike on Wednesday.
“Until this damage is repaired, we will be forced to close most of the hospital’s departments,” he said.
Muneer Alboursh, director general of the health ministry said that the world had turned a blind eye to the suffering of Palestinian civilians, saying that Gaza had become a “zone where human life is treated as expendable.”
“If this footage came from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Charite, or St. Thomas in London, the world would be on fire. Global leaders would descend. Investigations would launch within hours. But it was the European Hospital in Gaza – even its name couldn’t protect it,” Alboursh said.
Gaza Civil Defense said that three people were killed while on their way to the hospital Wednesday.
Hamas rejected any Israeli claims about Sinwar, saying in a statement, “The Palestinian resistance alone, through its official platforms, is the authority authorized to confirm or deny what is published.”
On Tuesday night, the IDF said it intercepted two rockets fired from Gaza, in what appears to be the first launch from the besieged territory in a month. A third rocket landed in an open area. The military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they fired at Israeli cities near Gaza.
A short time later, Israel issued evacuation warnings for the Jabalya refugee camp and nearby areas in northern Gaza, saying the IDF will “strike and operate in every location from which rockets are fired.”
‘They took the hostage and that’s it’
The targeting of Sinwar comes one day after Hamas released Israeli American Edan Alexander in what was a goodwill gesture to the United States. The deal for a single hostage’s release sidelined Israel, as Hamas communicated with the Trump administration.
Strikes in Gaza overnight killed at least 56 people, according to the director general of the Ministry of Health, with a nurse at a hospital in northern Gaza saying most were women and children.
Many of the dead from the overnight strikes were taken to the Indonesian Hospital. One man there, Mohammad al Arbid, said his cousin’s family had been killed and asked why there had been no relief after the release on Monday of the Israeli-American hostage.
“They took the hostage and that’s it, no aid entered, there are no blood units in the hospital, there is no medication, there is a 5-year old boy crying inside. He only needs painkiller and there isn’t (any) in the whole hospital, while the world is watching.”
The US expressed some optimism about negotiations set to take place in Qatar with President Donald Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff in the Middle East. Before leaving Israel, Witkoff promised the families of the hostages that he “will be relentless on that pursuit.”
But with negotiations about to start in Doha – and with an Israeli team en route – the targeting of Sinwar means Israel has just attempted to kill Hamas’ key decision maker needed to seal any potential agreement.
Israeli officials considered Mohammed Sinwar just as hardline as his brother, Yahya, but much more experienced militarily. According to the IDF, he commanded the Khan Younis Brigade until 2016. Like Yahya, he is believed to be one of the main planners of the October 7 terror attack on Israel.
Since the start of the war, he has remained hidden, along with many of Hamas’ senior leaders in Gaza. In December 2023, the IDF released video of what they said was Mohammed Sinwar driving through a tunnel in Gaza. In February 2024, the IDF said they had located his office in western Khan Younis.
Former US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro said Sinwar was likely an obstacle in negotiations. “There is little chance the war can end before he dies,” Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. “His removal could open the door for the release of all hostages and beginning to move toward a post-war future for Gaza without Hamas.”
But even if Sinwar is dead, it could take some time before Israel says officially that it has killed him, and even longer for Hamas to acknowledge his death. In mid-July, Israel said it had targeted Mohammed Deif in a strike on a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. It took until August, more than two weeks later, for the IDF to declare it had indeed killed Deif. Hamas did not confirm his death until the end of January, nearly six months later.
Second Sinwar targeted
Before October, it was primarily Yahya Sinwar who was in the crosshairs of the Israeli military. Imprisoned for four life sentences in 1988, Yahya became fluent in Hebrew and said he spent his years studying his enemy. He was released in 2011 as part of the deal to free Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for five years. His release has been attributed to the fact that his brother Mohammed was one of Shalit’s kidnappers and insisted on Yahya’s inclusion in the deal.
Back in Gaza, Yahya quickly rose through the ranks of the militant organization, ultimately becoming its leader
After October 7, Yahya became Israel’s most wanted man, and the IDF searched for him in the tiny coastal enclave. US officials believed Israel had come close to Yahya more than once, flushing him out of underground hiding places.
But Yahya moved undetected in the tunnels under Gaza, rarely coming above ground and avoiding detection by Israel’s electronic surveillance. Ultimately, it was a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza which engaged in a firefight in Rafah in southern Gaza that discovered Yahya’s body in Rafah.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/middleeast/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-aid-israel-intl,"The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it will start delivering aid to Gaza, but aid groups are skeptical. Here’s what we know",2025-05-15 14:13:05,"A controversial new American-backed organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has announced it will begin delivering aid to the besieged territory within two weeks and says it has Israel’s approval.
The move would provide some relief for Gazans facing acute hunger from 19 months of war and a two-and-half month Israeli blockade of all food, water, medical and humanitarian supplies.
More than half of Gaza’s population faces “emergency” or “catastrophic” levels of hunger, according to a UN-backed panel considered an authority on the matter.
But the foundation has come under significant criticism from top humanitarian officials, who warn that it is insufficient, could endanger civilians and even encourage their forced displacement.
Here’s what we know about the new aid mechanism.
Why is Israel blocking food from entering Gaza?
Israel started a total blockade on Gaza on March 2, the day after the initial phase of a ceasefire with Hamas expired.
Officials said their goal was to force the group to accept new ceasefire terms and release hostages taken from Israel on October 7, 2023.
Israel and the United States have also accused Hamas of stealing aid intended for Gaza’s civilian population. Hamas has rejected those claims, and humanitarian aid organizations say the overwhelming majority of food aid reaches civilians in need.
Whatever the motivation, the impact is clear.
The hunger crisis long predates Israel’s total blockade. Since Hamas’ attack, Israel has severely restricted the amount of aid that can enter Gaza. And even before October 2023, Israel and Egypt had imposed a partial blockade on Gaza, meaning that 63% of the population was food insecure.
Now that figure is 100%, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). It says that 70,000 children need urgent treatment for “acute malnutrition.”
What is the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation?
It’s a non-profit set up at the urging of the American government to help alleviate hunger in Gaza, while complying with Israeli demands that the aid not reach Hamas.
The American ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, laid out some of the goals for the organization in a press conference in Jerusalem last week.
It’s being led by Jake Wood, a US military veteran who founded and ran Team Rubicon, which has provided humanitarian relief during natural disasters.
“Aid diversion, active combat, and restricted access have prevented life-saving assistance from reaching the people it is meant to serve and eroded donor confidence,” the foundation said in a memorandum on its objectives. “GHF was established to restore that vital lifeline through an independent, rigorously-audited model that gets assistance directly – and only – to those in need.”
In its initial press releases, the GHF listed some heavy hitters that would sit on its board, lending it significant legitimacy: David Beasley, the former executive director of the WFP, and Nate Mook, the former head of World Central Kitchen.
But both Beasley and Mook told CNN that contrary to those initial announcements, neither is currently working with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. More on that in a bit.
How would it work?
The foundation says that it will set up “Secure Distribution Sites” to feed 1.2 million of Gaza’s estimated 2.1 million population – eventually ramping up, it hopes, to serve every Gazan.
It says that it will provide “pre-packaged rations, hygiene kits, and medical supplies.” It plans to move the aid through “tightly controlled corridors, monitored in real time to prevent diversion.”
It will accept both financial donations and “goods-in-kind,” meaning direct donations of food and other aid.
The group says that it will coordinate with the Israeli military, but that security will be provided by private military contractors, including an American firm that was on the ground during a ceasefire earlier this year.
A person involved in the planning told CNN on Thursday that following discussions with GHF, Israel had agreed to allow some aid into Gaza in the coming days. However, Israeli officials have yet to publicly confirm that. Israeli authorities did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.
The foundation said in a statement on Wednesday that it has called on Israel to authorize the entry of aid through existing mechanisms as a stop-gap measure until it is up and running. Israel has not yet publicly agreed.
Where would the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation get its food and money?
It’s unclear.
In its announcement this week, the GHF said that it was “in the final stages of procuring large volumes of food aid to supplement existing pledges from humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza.” It said that that would equate to more than 300 million meals.
It did not list the suppliers.
Huckabee told reporters last week that “there are some people who have already committed to helping fund” but that “they don’t want to be disclosed as of yet.”
What about the United Nations?
The UN has long carried the heaviest burden in feeding, education, and treating Palestinians in Gaza.
Israel has long had a contentious relationship with UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, but it was completely ruptured in the aftermath of October 7.
The Israeli government says that some UNRWA staff members participated in the October 7 attack on Israel; the agency fired most of those accused, but says that Israel never provided it with evidence against them.
That led Israel’s parliament to ban UNRWA from operating in Israel, making any UN-led humanitarian efforts extremely difficult.
But more importantly, the UN has said that it refuses to participate in the new American-backed Gaza aid initiative.
Why are the UN and humanitarian groups so critical of it?
The UN’s humanitarian chief called it a “cynical sideshow” at the UN Security Council this week.
The UN and other aid groups say that the way the GHF intends to work violates some basic humanitarian principles.
The fact that the initial sites would only be in southern and central Gaza could, the UN warned, be seen to be encouraging Israel’s publicly stated goal of forcing “the entire Gazan population” out of northern Gaza, as Defense Minister Israel Katz put it earlier this month. (The foundation says it has asked Israel to help up set up distribution points in the north.)
The UN says that the Israeli military’s involvement in securing the sites – even at a remove – could discourage participation, or lead to recipients facing reprisals. Private military contractors, the UN warns, could use force as a crowd control mechanism.
And crucially, it says that the initiative is simply insufficient. There are currently 400 distribution points in Gaza; this program would only have a handful, forcing people to “walk long distances carrying heavy rations.”
The US and the GHF have both been at pains to say that it is not an Israeli initiative – despite Israel’s support for it, and role in designating and securing the distribution sites.
“They will not be involved in the distribution of the food or even in the bringing of the food into Gaza,” Ambassador Huckabee said, referring to Israel. “Their role will remain on the perimeter.”
The UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, was scathing in his assessment to the UN Security Council this week.
“It restricts aid to only one part of Gaza, while leaving other dire needs unmet,” he said. “It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.”

Many of the casualties were in Jabalya in northern Gaza and in Khan Younis in the south, according to Gaza Civil Defense.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to eradicate Hamas with a strategy that would see the military hold more territory in Gaza and push the entire civilian population into a smaller area in the south.
“There will be no in-and-out,” Netanyahu said earlier this month. “We’ll call up reserves to come, hold territory – we’re not going to enter and then exit the area, only to carry out raids afterward.”
The intensified Israeli attacks come amid what appears to be growing differences between the US and Israeli governments. President Donald Trump said last week that he wants an end to the “brutal war” in Gaza and has skipped Israel in his Middle East tour. He also bypassed Israel twice this month in bilateral deals reached with regional militant groups. Hamas released an Israeli-American hostage last week, and the Houthis agreed to stop firing at American ships in the Red Sea while pledging to continue fighting Israel.
On Wednesday, Trump denied that Israel was sidelined. “This is good for Israel,” he said.
But on Thursday, he said he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone.”
“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” Trump said in Qatar.
The latest Israeli operations came as the Palestinian Ministry of Health announced that the number killed by the Israeli offensive in Gaza since October 2023 now exceeds 53,000.
Mahmoud Basal, a Civil Defense spokesman, said: “We are currently reporting more than 100 martyrs in areas of the Gaza Strip (on Thursday), from central Khan Younis to northern Gaza.”
Basal said a family of six, including four children, had been killed in Jabalya. The father was a nurse at Kamal Adwan hospital, according to the hospital.
He said that an Israeli bombardment had also killed 13 people at a Jabalya clinic where a large number of Gazans had gathered. Al Awda hospital said it had received many wounded people after the strike on the clinic.
CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the reported strike.
‘I thought I was a martyr’
In Khan Younis, 11 members of one family were killed in an airstrike on a house, according to a CNN stringer who visited the scene. A teenage boy, Ahmad Al-Safi, who had been displaced from northern Gaza, told CNN: “I was sleeping and I thought the house fell on us. I went into a state of shock… I thought I was a martyr.”
The Palestinian Ministry of Health reported Thursday that 82 bodies had been received at Gaza hospitals in the past 24 hours, as well as 152 injured people. It said the number killed as a result of Israeli military operations since October 2023 had risen to 53,010. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants. In January, the IDF said it had killed 20,000 Hamas operatives since October 7.
The IDF continues to issue evacuation orders for different parts of Gaza. The latest was directed at people in the Rimal neighborhood on the coastline in central Gaza on Wednesday. The IDF’s Arabic language spokesman said on X the order was due to “Hamas’s terrorist activities in the area,” adding that it also “bombed the area and will continue to target it today and in the coming days.”
UN agencies are expressing alarm at the worsening situation for civilians.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs posted on X Thursday that the “blockade, displacement orders, and ongoing bombardments – including on tents, hospitals and schools – continue to drive mass casualties, displacement and deprivation.”
It cited a UN study this week warning that with “the persistent inability of humanitarian agencies to access populations in dire need, an anticipated escalation in hostilities, and the continued mass displacement of people, the risk of famine in the Gaza Strip is not just possible – it is increasingly likely.”
‘We are destroying more and more homes’
The Israeli government has not been swayed by a growing tide of international criticism over the blockade on aid reaching Gaza, now in its third month.
Netanyahu said earlier this week: “We are destroying more and more homes, they have nowhere to return to. The only inevitable outcome will be the desire of Gazans to emigrate outside of the Gaza Strip,” a goal that Trump had supported soon after coming into office.
Negotiations on a fresh ceasefire that would see the remaining hostages released appear to have stalled. The Qatari prime minister told CNN Wednesday he does not expect to see progress soon in the negotiations his country is mediating, criticizing Israel for sending a “bad signal” by continuing to bomb the enclave while dispatching a delegation to talks in Doha.
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani told CNN’s Becky Anderson that he had seen the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander this week as a “breakthrough that will help bring back the talks on track.”
But he added: “Unfortunately Israel’s reaction to this was (bombing) the next day, while sending the delegation.” He accused Israel of “basically sending the signal that (they) are not interested in negotiations.”
An Israeli official told CNN Thursday there had been no progress in the talks in Doha, which were still ongoing.
Israel wants to extend the first phase of the deal to continue the exchange of hostages, alive and deceased, in return for further releases of Palestinian prisoners and the flow of aid into Gaza – but without any commitment to permanently ending the war.
Hamas claimed Thursday that while mediators were working to “steer negotiations back on track,” Israel was carrying out mass bombardment “in a desperate attempt to impose terms under fire.”
Hamas also said that it expected, “according to the understandings reached with the American side, and with the knowledge of the mediators, that humanitarian aid will begin to enter the Gaza Strip immediately, [and] calling for a permanent ceasefire,” after its release of Alexander.
It added that “the failure to achieve these steps, especially the introduction of humanitarian assistance to our people, will cast a negative shadow over any efforts to complete the negotiations on the prisoner exchange process.”","['Tim Lister', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Kareem Khadder', 'Eugenia Yosef', 'Mohammad Al-Sawalhi']",en

The IDF strike targeted the surgical ward on the hospital’s third floor, which is now “completely out of service,” killing two patients and wounding medical staff, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said.
The target of the strike was Hassan Eslaiah, a prominent Gaza photojournalist who Israel accuses of being a terrorist. He was being treated at the hospital after being wounded in an earlier targeted Israeli airstrike in April.
The IDF has accused Eslaiah of taking part in the attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, and of belonging to Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade, although it has not provided evidence to support those claims.
In a statement following Tuesday’s strike, it described him as working “under the guise of a journalist” and said that it had eliminated him and other “significant Hamas terrorits” in a “precise strike.”
Eslaiah crossed into Israel on October 7, 2023, documenting the attacks in photographs that were published by multiple major news organizations. He had previously said he had no forewarning of the attacks and rushed to the scene to document a major news event alongside other photojournalists.
CNN, along with other news organizations, had periodically used material provided by Eslaiah. CNN cut ties with him in November 2023 after new allegations emerged of links to Hamas. CNN said he was not working with the network on October 7, 2023.
Eslaiah said from his hospital bed in April that he faced “false allegations” from the IDF and that he was “not fighting or anything.”
The Ramallah-based Palestinian Journalists Protection Center condemned Eslaiah’s killing, demanding an international investigation into what they described as a “heinous assassination.” The center called Eslaiah’s killing the “deliberate targeting of the voice of truth.”
The Nasser hospital strike on Tuesday is the latest example of deliberate Israeli attacks on medical facilities in Gaza, for which Israel has been accused of violating international law.
Hospitals are entitled to special protections during armed conflict under international humanitarian law and can only be targeted under extremely limited circumstances, such as if they are being used to actively commit “an act harmful to the enemy,” according to the Geneva Conventions.
The latest attack on Nasser hospital “totally destroyed” two patient rooms, partially damaged three others and a nursing station, according to MAP’s medical activity coordinator who is based at Nasser Hospital.
“The extension of the intensive care unit, which contains three ICU beds, was also affected – its electrical and oxygen systems were damaged in the strike – rendering the entire section non-operational,” the coordinator said in a statement provided by MAP.
The strike adds to an already rapidly deteriorating situation for Gaza’s medical facilities.
Nasser hospital’s medical director Dr. Atef Al-Hout said the hospital is rapidly running out of fuel to power its generators amid Israel’s now 10-week blockade of the strip.
Following the release of Alexander, the Israeli American hostage, the United States is renewing its push for a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.
An Israeli delegation was set to fly to Qatar on Tuesday to resume negotiations, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed those talks will continue “under fire,” with no slowdown in Israeli strikes expected without a deal.",['Oren Liebermann'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/middleeast/israel-hamas-edan-alexander-release-intl,Edan Alexander: Israeli-American hostage returns to Israel after Hamas release,2025-05-12 15:38:56,"Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, was released by Hamas and reunited with his family on Monday, ending an 18-month ordeal that began with the militant group’s October 7 attack.
Hamas announced Sunday night it had agreed to free Alexander, 21, after several days of talks with the United States, which bypassed Israel, and formed part of an effort to reach a ceasefire and resume the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Alexander, wearing a black Adidas t-shirt and a baseball cap, was photographed during his handover to the Red Cross, shortly before his convoy left Khan Younis and headed towards Israel. He later arrived at an Israeli military base for a medical assessment and a long-awaited reunion with his family.
Alexander had spoken to his mother, Yael, on the phone after Hamas released him. Footage shared by the Israel Defense Forces showed Steve Witkoff, the US Middle East envoy, handing a phone to Yael.
“You’re out, my soul, you’re out!” she exclaimed in the emotional clip. “Everything’s alright, you’re fine, you’re safe, you’re home. Everything is good. You’ve got this. You’re strong. We’re meeting soon.”
Following a medical evaluation, Alexander’s condition appeared “stable over all,” Professor Gil Fire from Tel Aviv’s Sourasky Medical Center said in a statement Tuesday. Alexander was born in the same hospital, according to the doctor, who added that the team there would further assess the full medical implications of his prolonged captivity in the coming days.
In Tel Aviv, Alexander was shown holding US and Israeli flags as he embraced members of his family. The reunion comes as US President Donald Trump embarks on a Middle East tour, with stops planned in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.
The Trump administration had circumvented Israel to seal the deal with Hamas to free Alexander, with Trump framing it as a step “to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.”
A New Jersey native, Alexander was serving in the Israeli military near the Gaza border when he was abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Yael described her son as “such an American kid, full of life, very funny, very friendly” in an interview with CNN in March.
Following Alexander’s release, 58 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with at least 20 believed to be alive. Among the deceased hostages are four American citizens, including husband and wife Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai, as well as soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Monday “a very emotional moment,” effusively praising Trump for securing Alexander’s release and defending his ongoing campaign in Gaza.
“This was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the diplomatic pressure applied by President Trump. This is a winning combination,” Netanyahu said.
“I spoke with President Trump today. He told me ‘I am committed to Israel. I am committed to continuing to work with you in close cooperation’ –- in order to achieve all of our war objectives: Releasing all of the hostages, and defeating Hamas,” his statement continued. “This goes together. They are combined with each other.”
A crowd gathered in Tel Aviv’s “Hostage Square” to watch his release take place. They cheered as it became clear that Alexander was handed over to Israeli forces.
Alexander’s mother boarded a flight to Israel on Sunday night to meet her son after his release. A photo posted by US Special Envoy for Hostage Response Adam Boehler showed Yael Alexander on a commercial flight with the envoy’s team.
Alexander’s parents, Yael and Adi, thanked Trump, Witkoff and Boehler for their role in bringing their son home, during a speech at Sourasky Medical Center on Tuesday. Neither mentioned Netanyahu.
His father said Edan would soon be returning to the United States, “to watch his little brother play basketball and reunite with his friends in New Jersey.”
“He’s 21 now and those happy times may include a beer or two, but we will never forget the first beer he had on the rooftop of this very building since his release,” Adi Alexander added.
‘Monumental news’
Trump hailed the development as “monumental news” in a post on Truth Social, where he described Alexander’s release by Hamas as a “step taken in good faith toward the United States and the efforts of the mediators – Qatar and Egypt – to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.”
Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi told the Hamas-affiliated Al Aqsa TV that the militant group, classified as a terrorist organization by the US and Israel, directly negotiated with the US to free Alexander in exchange for the resumption of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Witkoff told CNN the talks with Hamas were indirect.
Alexander was last seen in a proof-of-life video in mid-April in which he appealed directly to Trump for help in securing his release. Just days later, Hamas claimed they had lost contact with the group of militants holding Alexander.
Gaza is on the brink of famine as Israel’s blockade of humanitarian aid and commercial goods stretches into its second month, depleting food warehouses and soup kitchens, and sending the cost of basic goods skyrocketing.
Israel says it cut off the entry of humanitarian aid to pressure Hamas to release hostages. But international organizations say its actions violate international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war – a war crime.
Israel has not said if it will resume humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Monday that Israel has not committed to a ceasefire, nor the release of any Palestinian prisoners, only to “a safe corridor that will allow for Edan’s release.”
In a post on social media Sunday night, Trump said he hoped the release would lead to the “end (of) this brutal conflict.” But the long-time Israeli prime minister has said that “negotiations will take place under fire.”
Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, said in a Monday statement welcomed efforts to halt the war and issued rare praise for Trump.
Abbas “commended US President Donald Trump for his position, in which the latter hopes to bring an end to the vicious conflict and the war that has been going on for two years,” the statement from his office said.
Alexander’s parents had fought tirelessly for his release. Speaking to CNN in March, Yael said she prayed and hoped she would see her son again.
“I’m a mom I just want to hold him again, and to say ‘Edan, you’re safe, you’re home.’”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/middleeast/israel-gaza-starvation-report-intl-hnk,"One in five people in Gaza face starvation, report warns, as Israel’s months-long blockade continues",2025-05-13 11:38:10,"One in five people in the Gaza Strip are facing starvation as the entire territory edges closer to famine, a new United Nations-backed report warns, after nearly three months of Israel’s blockade of critically needed humanitarian aid.
The warning comes as the UN and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza, say the situation has deteriorated since Israel launched its renewed assault on the enclave in March, as residents struggle to access food, medicine and clean water.
The enclave’s entire population is experiencing “high levels of acute food security” and the territory is at “high risk” of famine, the most severe type of hunger crisis, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in its latest report Monday.
“Goods indispensable for people’s survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks,” the IPC said. Food is running out, and what little is left is being sold at exorbitant prices that few can afford, it said.
Israel imposed a humanitarian blockade on Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory. Israel says the blockade, along with the military’s expansion of its bombardment of Gaza, is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages held in the enclave – but international organizations say it violates international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.
There is a “high risk” that famine will occur between now and the end of September, the IPC report warned, leaving most people in Gaza without access to food, water, shelter, and medicine.
“Only an immediate and sustained cessation of hostilities and the resumption of humanitarian aid delivery can prevent a descent into famine,” the report said.
Under the IPC system – a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity – a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. Those conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.
The first threshold has already been met, according to the IPC. Nearly 469,500 people – around 22% of the population - will likely experience “catastrophic” food insecurity, the highest phase on the IPC scale, between May and September, the report said.
David Mencer, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, said Monday that “famine has never happened” in Gaza, despite IPC warnings, and that if there is hunger in Gaza, it is caused by Hamas depriving civilians of humanitarian aid.
Whilst largely pinning the blame on Hamas for rising hunger levels, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee on Friday acknowledged the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza, telling CNN: “If there wasn’t a humanitarian crisis, there wouldn’t be an effort to try to deal with it. So, the answer is, obviously yes, there is a humanitarian crisis.”
Since March, Israel’s renewed assault has displaced more than 430,000 people, the report said, disrupting essential services and the distribution of critical supplies.
All 25 bakeries run by the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) were forced to shutter at the beginning of April due to lack of supplies, and food is running out at most of the 177 hot meal kitchens, according to the IPC report. And food prices are soaring.
Prices for flour have increased 3,000% since February and 55-pound sack of wheat flour can run anywhere between $235 and $520, the report said.
At a Monday press conference, the UN Secretary General’s spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said only “about 260,000 meals have been prepared and delivered across the Gaza Strip” on Monday, which is a 70% reduction since last Wednesday.
According to the spokesperson, the blockade, which has passed 70 days, has depleted UN agencies’ food reserves. “Stocks have run out, bakeries have shut down, community kitchens are closing daily, and people are starving,” he said.
Pregnant women and children among the most at risk
Children and pregnant women are at particularly high risk. Nearly 71,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children under five are expected between April 2025 and March 2026, the report said. And nearly 17,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women will need treatment for acute malnutrition, it said.
During the nineteen months since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in the wake of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, people have resorted to scavenging for food, eating grass and animal feed, and drinking polluted water. Starving mothers have been unable to produce enough milk to feed their babies and parents have scrambled to keep their children alive, parents and doctors told CNN.
Imran Rajab, a mother living in Gaza city, told CNN earlier this month she was forced to bake bread using flour from a garbage dumpster to feed her six children.
“My kids are vomiting after they eat it. It smells horrible,” Rajab said. “But what else can I do? What will I feed my children if not this?”
Dr. Amjad Al-Muzaini, a gynecologist working in Gaza City, said women in Gaza are forced to choose between feeding their children or caring for their own health. Most often, they sacrifice their own well-being to ensure survival, he said.
While doing cesarean surgeries, women were found to have severely deteriorated intestinal and uterine tissues, Al-Muzaini said, likely the effects of eating poor-quality and mainly canned foods.
The WFP has said recently it is ready to surge enough aid into Gaza to feed the entire population for up to two months. UNRWA, the main UN agency supporting Palestinians, said it has nearly 3,000 trucks filled with aid waiting to cross into Gaza that is currently blocked by Israel.
“Families in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,” the WFP’s Executive Director, Cindy McCain said on X. “But WFP hasn’t been able to get new aid in since 2 March.”
“If we wait for famine to be officially confirmed, it will be TOO LATE,” she said.
Israel launched its war in Gaza following Hamas’ October 2023 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Since then, Israel’s military campaign has killed almost 53,000 Palestinians. Since Israel resumed its bombardment in March, more than 2,500 Palestinians have been killed, according to figures provided by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.","['Lex Harvey', 'Abeer Salman', 'Mounira Elsamra']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/middleeast/israel-trump-middle-east-intl,Trump’s Middle East trip leaves Netanyahu watching from the sidelines again,2025-05-12 14:14:25,"The first stop was Riyadh.
Just a few months into his new administration, the president of the United States met the king of Saudi Arabia as part of an effort to push forward relations with the Arab world.
From there, it was off to another regional capital, where the leader of the free world gave a speech about a new vision for the Middle East.
Conspicuously missing from the itinerary was a stop in Israel.
The year was 2009, and the president was Barack Obama. His decision not to visit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had just returned to office, was viewed as an insult. It marked the beginning of what many to this day see as Obama’s fractured relationship with Israel, and particularly with the country’s longest-serving leader.
But as President Donald Trump prepares for his first visit to the region in his second term, the same elephant sits in the same corner of the Oval Office. Trump’s itinerary includes Saudi Arabia – where he’ll arrive early Tuesday local time– Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
The White House has called it a “historic return to the Middle East” and promised “a shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect.” Israel is once again not on the itinerary. And after Trump blindsided Israel several times already – announcing talks with Iran, a deal with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, and direct talks with Hamas – Israeli officials are concerned another surprise could be coming.
‘Without results, he’s not coming’
Israeli officials tried to inquire about the possibility of a stop in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv during Trump’s trip, according to a source familiar with the matter. But the president doused the flicker of those hopes last week when he said he had no plans to stop in Israel.
“We will be doing it at some point,” Trump said. “But not for this trip.”
Trump might have been persuaded to add the visit to his itinerary if he could claim some sort of victory, whether it be a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, a humanitarian aid plan, or something else. But with Israel poised to expand its war in Gaza, there are no such deliverables. Even with the release of hostage Edan Alexander on Monday, prospects for a comprehensive ceasefire still seem distant.
“Without results, he’s not coming (to Israel),” said the source.
Netanyahu prided himself on being the first world leader to visit Trump in his second term in February. On his second visit, in April, he became the first leader to try to begin negotiations for a new trade deal after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports. The prime minister left the White House without a trade deal and with a new concern: Trump’s shock announcement that the US would begin negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran.
The problem for Netanyahu is that he has little leverage in Washington right now, said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat.
“There’s nothing that Netanyahu has that Trump wants, needs or (that he) can give him, as opposed to, say, the Saudis, the Qataris, (or) the Emiratis,” Pinkas told CNN. The wealthy Arab nations have pledged trillions of dollars in US investments and may announce major weapons purchases, which Trump can tout as a victory for American manufacturing.
Despite years of being perhaps Trump’s most vocal international supporter, Netanyahu has few cards left to play, Pinkas said. Under Democratic administrations, Netanyahu has used his Republican supporters to put pressure on the White House. But Netanyahu has never criticized Trump openly, and he’s unlikely to start.
“He’s got nothing right now,” Pinkas said.
‘A policy of surprises’
As Trump’s visit to the region nears, Israeli officials’ concerns about what it will bring have only grown.
In the weeks leading up to his trip, Trump has made a series of moves that have left the Israeli prime minister looking little more than a frustrated bystander. Trump has pursued negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program that don’t preclude the possibility of Tehran maintaining some civilian nuclear capabilities; he agreed to a ceasefire with the Houthis that doesn’t halt the Yemeni group’s attacks on Israel; and according to a Reuters report is also no longer demanding that Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel as a condition to facilitating a Saudi civil nuclear program.
And on Sunday, the Trump administration bypassed Israel to seal a deal with Hamas to free Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, with Trump framing it as a step “to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.”
Israeli officials are now concerned what a week spent meeting with and being feted by Gulf leaders – all of whom have been critical of Israel’s military assault in Gaza and its ongoing humanitarian blockade of the strip – will mean for Trump’s posture vis-à-vis the war and ceasefire negotiations.
Leading up to Trump’s trip, the US has been heavily pressing Egypt and Qatar to convince Hamas to agree to the release of some hostages, a source familiar with the negotiations said, in exchange for several weeks of ceasefire and the entry of humanitarian aid.
The Trump administration now appears to be aiming even higher. Another source familiar with the matter tells CNN the release of Alexander will lead to “immediate peace deal negotiations.”
A comprehensive agreement to end the war has remained out of reach, but Trump has made clear that that is his goal.
“Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict,” Trump said on social media on Sunday.
The result is that Trump and Netanyahu seem to be more at odds than ever, a situation that comes shortly after Netanyahu doubled down on the war and made explicitly clear he believes defeating Hamas is more important than securing the release of the hostages. If a deal with Hamas for the return of more hostages seems within reach, the US will drive up the pressure on Israel to accept it, another source familiar with the matter said.
Until now, there were major doubts about whether Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Mohammad Sinwar, would agree to a limited deal. But Hamas seems to have shrewdly outplayed Israel this time around when it comes to Trump.
And Trump’s visit to the region will serve as a pressure point to potentially unlock a deal.
Trump moving forward ‘like a bulldozer’
“There has to be a practice of no surprises” on either side, said Dan Shapiro, a former US Ambassador to Israel and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, DC. “Otherwise, the trust that is so essential for this partnership breaks down really, really quickly.”
Trump is moving forward “like a bulldozer” for what he wants, Shapiro told CNN, and that wish list currently includes progress on a ceasefire deal and a hostage release. Netanyahu’s tendency to drag his feet on major decisions and his history of prioritizing his own political survival appear to have contributed to the White House’s willingness to forgo consultation with Israel on key decisions, he said.
“He’s clearly frustrated with Netanyahu, as every other president who’s worked with Netanyahu has been,” Shapiro said.
Meanwhile, Trump’s man in Jerusalem, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee, has tried to downplay speculation about a rift between the two leaders, and said he would “fully expect” Trump to visit Israel this year.
“No president has ever cared as much and done as much as President Trump has for the state of Israel,” Huckabee told Israel’s Channel 13 News in an interview aired Saturday evening. “And his relationship with the prime minister is, I think, remarkable.”
Israelis see it differently.
The front page of the prominent Yedioth Ahronot newspaper last Thursday showed a cartoon of Trump with the headline “A policy of surprises.” As Trump prepares a soup, Netanyahu sits nervously in the background.","['Oren Liebermann', 'Jeremy Diamond']",en

The warning, posted on social media by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic media spokesperson Avichay Adraee, warned people to evacuate the ports of Ras Isa, Hodeidah, and Salif.
The anticipated airstrikes come two days after Israel intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, according to the IDF.
That missile was the first since President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire deal between the US and the Iran-backed rebel group last week.
Despite the deal, the Houthis said they would continue to attack Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian population of Gaza.
Blindsided by the deal, Israel vowed it would strike the Houthis alone if necessary.
“Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat and any enemy,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement last week. “This has been true in the face of many past challenges, and it will remain true in the future.”
This marks the second time within a week that Israel has issued an evacuation warning for Yemen.
Last Tuesday, the military issued a warning for Yemen’s international airport in the capital of Sana’a before carrying out strikes that it said “fully” disabled the facility.","['Eyad Kourdi', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/middleeast/us-gaza-aid-plan-un-rejection-intl,"US admits its new aid plan would initially only feed 60% of Gaza, as UN rejects proposal",2025-05-09 15:13:26,"US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee outlined an American-Israeli plan to funnel humanitarian aid into parts of Gaza that he acknowledged will initially feed only about 60% of the population.
Huckabee said the aid mechanism, which will be administered by a newly formed private foundation stood up by the US, will aim to distribute food in a way that “Hamas is not able to get their hands on it.”
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of stealing and profiting off aid shipments to Gaza, but humanitarian aid organizations say the overwhelming majority of food aid reaches civilians in need.
Under the US-Israeli plan, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, as it’s called, would set up distribution sites that would be secured by private US military contractors and manned by aid workers. The Israeli military would “be involved in providing necessary military security” outside the immediate area of the distribution sites, Huckabee said, speaking at the US embassy in Jerusalem.
The foundation will initially establish four distribution sites which will aim to provide “pre-packaged rations, hygiene kits, and medical supplies” to a total of 1.2 million Palestinians, or about 60% of Gaza’s population, according to a foundation document obtained by CNN.
Pressed by CNN what the remaining 40% of Gaza’s population is expected to do, Huckabee said the mechanism will be “scaled up” over time.
“You have to start somewhere and the somewhere feeds an enormous level of the people of Gaza,” Huckabee said, before repeatedly blaming Hamas for rising hunger in Gaza. Aid groups have repeatedly attributed hunger in Gaza to Israel’s total blockade of humanitarian relief.
The planning has been going on for months but kicked into high gear in the last few weeks, said a source familiar with the matter, cautioning that there is still “a significant amount of planning and resourcing to be done.”
“The genuine intention is to develop a secure way to deliver aid that does not enable Hamas or (Palestinian Islamic Jihad) to get their hands on the aid before it reaches the point of need. In the hands of individual Palestinian families in Gaza,” the source added, saying both the US and Israel have no confidence in the United Nations-based system that has been used in the past.
There appear to have been some attempts to sway parties reluctant to join the mechanism. US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff held an “informal briefing” with UN Security Council members on Wednesday, where Gaza was discussed, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Hamas said the new proposal was part of “Israeli plans for displacement and subjugation through a policy of starvation.”
In a statement released Friday afternoon, Hamas called on the international community “to take urgent action to prevent the militarization of aid and its transformation into a tool for managing starvation and a blatant violation of humanitarian standards.”
UN rejects plan
The United Nations and other primary aid groups in Gaza have rejected the US-Israeli plan, which they say would facilitate the forced displacement of Palestinians and fail to meet the needs of the population.
“This mechanism appears practically unfeasible, incompatible with humanitarian principles and will create serious insecurity risks, all while failing to meet Israel’s obligations under international law,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs wrote this week in a document obtained by CNN.
The UN also criticized the plan for a critically low number of distribution sites instead of the roughly 400 that operated in Gaza before Israel’s total blockade. With only a handful of sites under the plan the Trump administration is pushing, displaced Palestinians could be forced to walk long distances carrying heavy packages of rations for large families.
UN agencies have instead called on Israel to lift its nearly 10-week siege on Gaza and allow aid to flow in freely, which Israel has rejected.
The main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Friday that “basic humanitarian supplies, including food, fuel, medical aid and vaccines for children, are rapidly running out; UNRWA flour and food parcels have run out and over one third of essential medical supplies are already out of stock.”
“This is having a devastating impact on the population, particularly on vulnerable groups including children, women and the elderly,” UNRWA said.
Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the organization representing Palestinian aid groups working in Gaza, told CNN it had received no information about the proposal and said the organizations involved in the US plan would “not consider the basic humanitarian principle of our people.”
Starvation is ‘the greatest danger’
Huckabee acknowledged the deteriorating situation in Gaza, saying: “The greatest danger, the most important danger, people starving to death.”
“If there wasn’t a humanitarian crisis, there wouldn’t be an effort to try to deal with it. So the answer is, obviously yes, there is a humanitarian crisis,” Huckabee told CNN.
Huckabee said “several partners” have agreed to participate in the new mechanism, but he declined to name them “because some of the details of their participation are being worked out.” He repeatedly said the plan is not yet finalized and said the initial implementation “will not be perfect, especially in the early days.”
Israeli officials continue to deny the extent of the crisis created by the military’s blockade that began on March 2.
On Wednesday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Heskel told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that “the situation in Gaza is very far from what the reports are actually saying” and called reports of starvation “complete lies.”
It will likely take at least two more weeks before the new mechanism can start bringing aid into Gaza, a source familiar with the plans said. And it will take several more weeks before the program can be scaled up to serve a larger share of Gaza’s population.
But the very launch of the mechanism is still in question amid opposition from the major humanitarian aid players.
“Everyone who’s been saying there’s a crisis, I expect them to step up and to now join the effort to resolve it,” Huckabee said.
Some humanitarian aid players have signed up, according to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation document obtained by CNN. The former CEO of disaster response organization Team Rubicon is expected to serve as executive director; and the former chief executive of World Central Kitchen Nate Mook is expected to serve on the board of directors.
But in a sign of how many aspects of the plan are still being finalized, the former executive director of the UN’s World Food Programme, David Beasely is only one tentatively listed as joining the foundation’s advisory board, with “to be finalized” appended to his name.

The US deal, announced just hours after the Israeli military carried out major strikes against Yemen’s international airport and other facilities in response to a Houthi attack on Israel’s main airport, was a surprise to Israel, which was not informed in advance about the truce, an Israeli official told CNN earlier.
According to Trump, the US would halt an ongoing military campaign against the Houthis in exchange for the group stopping its attacks on US interests in the region.
The Houthis acknowledged the agreement but made it clear their attacks on Israel would continue. Senior Houthi leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi said after the announcement that the agreement was “a victory that separates US support for the temporary entity (Israel) and a failure for Netanyahu.”
On Wednesday, Netanyahu said, “Israel will defend itself by itself.” In the past, Israel has carried out joint strikes with the US against the Houthis, but two consecutive days of Israeli attacks on Yemen earlier this week were done alone. “If others join us—our American friends—all the better. If they don’t, we will still defend ourselves on our own,” he said in a video posted on social media.
Trump referred to the deal as capitulation from the Houthis on Tuesday but on Wednesday he said they had a “good outcome with the Houthis,” adding they had a “great capacity to withstand punishment” from repeated US strikes.
“You could say there’s a lot of bravery there,” Trump said at a swearing-in of his ambassador to China at the White House. “It was amazing what they took.”
He added that the US would “honor their (Houthis’) commitment” not to attack US warships or commercial vessels in the region.
Trump ‘thinks about America’s interests’
The US-Houthi truce sidelined the Israeli government, according to former US Middle East envoy Dennis Ross.
He noted that Netanyahu was left in the dark when the US began talks with Hamas in March and only found out about US nuclear talks with Iran when Trump made the announcement seated next to the prime minister in the Oval Office last month. The US-Houthi ceasefire is one more instance where Israel’s concerns were a tertiary consideration for the White House, if at all, he said.
Whether Houthi ballistic missile launches against Israel continue remains to be seen, but Ross told CNN that Israel does not appear to have been a major factor in the White House’s thought process.
“The Trump Administration thinks about America’s interests,” said Ross.
There has been no public criticism of the White House decision from Israeli officials. Netanyahu, who once openly criticized the Biden administration’s requests and policies, is one of Trump’s most vocal international supporters. Other members of the government have reserved their judgement as well, instead focusing on Israel’s resolve against the Houthis.
Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Thursday that “Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat and any enemy. This has been true in the face of many past challenges, and it will remain true in the future.”","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/middleeast/israeli-military-extends-detention-of-palestinian-journalist-intl,Israeli military extends detention of Palestinian journalist despite acknowledging lack of evidence,2025-05-08 12:40:55,"The Israeli military acknowledged Thursday that it does not have “sufficient evidence” to substantiate terrorism funding allegations it leveled against a prominent Palestinian journalist, even as an Israeli general ordered he be detained for another six months.
The Israeli military’s top general in the occupied West Bank ordered the journalist, Ali Samoudi, 58, to be held under administrative detention, which allows the military to hold individuals without trial for up to six months at a time. Administrative detention orders can be renewed indefinitely.
The commander issued the order on Wednesday following a military court hearing last week during which prosecutors sought to extend his detention.
“As sufficient evidence was not found against him, and in light of the accumulated intelligence material, security authorities requested to consider issuing an administrative detention order,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement to CNN. “Today, after reviewing the intelligence, the commanding officer of the Central Command decided to place him under administrative detention for a period of six months.”
Palestinians living in the West Bank are subject to Israeli military law and are typically tried in military courts, not Israeli civilian courts.
Samoudi, a prominent Palestinian journalist who has worked with CNN and other Western news outlets, was detained by Israeli forces on April 29 following an early morning raid on his son’s home in the West Bank city of Jenin.
At the time, the Israeli military accused him of transferring funds to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group in the West Bank and Gaza which Israel considers a terrorist organization. The Israeli military provided no evidence to back up its claim.
Israeli military prosecutors never leveled that accusation in court, Samoudi’s lawyer Jamil al-Khatib said, instead vaguely accusing Samoudi of harming the activity of Israeli forces in the West Bank.
The military’s administrative detention order cites Samoudi’s “presence posing a danger to the security of the region” as justification for his detention.
He is one of 20 journalists detained and held under administrative detention since the start of the war in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS).
“Samoudi’s arrest and administrative detention is part of the occupation’s escalating campaign of targeting journalists, particularly through the systematic use of administrative detention,” the PPS said in a statement.
Samoudi is now being held in Megiddo prison in central Israel, according to his lawyer, where he is still waiting to receive his eyeglasses and medications for several chronic conditions, including high blood pressure and diabetes.
One of the most well-known Palestinian journalists in the West Bank, Samoudi has worked with international news organizations for decades as a local producer and fixer.
He was also a witness to the high-profile killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, by Israeli forces in 2022, during which he was also shot.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Kareem Khadder']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/middleeast/syrian-president-talks-israel-intl-hnk,Syrian president says his government is holding indirect talks with Israel,2025-05-07 00:00:00,"Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa has said that his government is holding indirect talks with Israel to bring an end to Israeli attacks on Syria.
“There are indirect negotiations (with Israel) via mediators to calm and contain the situation so matters don’t reach a point where both sides lose control,” Al-Sharaa said at a news conference in Paris.
“We are trying to speak to all the countries that are in contact with the Israeli side to pressure them to stop interfering in Syrian affairs.”
Al-Sharaa said the objective is for Israel to abide by the United Nations-brokered 1974 disengagement agreement with Syria, and retreat to the boundary it demarcated to make way for the return of UN peacekeepers. The boundary separates Syria proper from Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war.
Since the regime of former President Bashar al-Assad fell in December, Israel has taken more territory in Syria and staged multiple attacks to prevent reconstitution of military capabilities and root out militancy that it says could threaten its security. Israel’s move into Syrian territory was initially described as temporary but officials have since said that the military will remain in Syria indefinitely.
Israel has declared a buffer zone in the south of Syria with the stated aim of protecting Syria’s Druze minority, and on Wednesday Israel Police said that its Border Police are now operating inside Syria, for the first time.
“The Israeli interventions have violated the 1974 agreement. Since we arrived in Damascus we stated to all relevant parties that Syria is committed to the 1974 agreement,” Al-Sharaa said.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United Arab Emirates has set up a back channel for talks between Israel and Syria, citing sources it didn’t identify. The talks are focused on security and intelligence matters and confidence-building, it said. Al-Sharaa visited the UAE last month.
But Lana Nusseibeh, UAE assistant foreign minister for political affairs, denied that her country was mediating talks between Israel and Syria.
“The claim that the UAE is ‘mediating secret talks’ between Syria and Israel is categorically false. The UAE is not part of any such talks,” she said.

Dozens more were injured in the strike, they said.
At the site of one attack in the Al Bureij camp in central Gaza on Tuesday, video from the scene showed a large crater where people searched through the rubble of the school for survivors, the remnants of tents and belongings littering the ground.
According to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, 33 people were killed in the strike, including women and children.
Safaa Al Khaldi, who was sheltering at the school, said that her son was injured in the strike.
“Our children are starving, our children cannot find a piece of bread,” she said, referring to Israel’s complete blockade of Gaza, now in its third month. “What did we do wrong?”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck “terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control center,” on Tuesday, but did not provide any further information about the strike.
At the school compound, one woman screamed at Hamas, an expression of anger at Gaza’s ruling militants once virtually unthinkable. “Hamas should get out of the school, they are hiding between the people,” she cried. “Get them out, what’s the fault of the children who are torn apart?”
Footage from the scene obtained by CNN showed dead and injured near the school compound with ambulances ready to rush the wounded to hospitals. Another child, bloodied and bandaged, is seen being taken out of an ambulance on a stretcher.
Tuesday’s strike on the refugee camp comes less than 24 hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the population of Gaza will be displaced to the south after his security cabinet approved an expanded military operation in the enclave.
“There will be a movement of the population to protect them,” Netanyahu said of the “intensified operation,” which by one far-right minister said would be a plan to “conquer” the besieged territory.
A strike on a school in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood east of Gaza City on Wednesday killed at least 15 people sheltering inside and wounded 10 more, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense.
A pair of Israeli strikes near the Palmyra market in Gaza City killed 33 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and wounded at least 85 others. Video from the crowded market in the aftermath of the bombing showed a scene of chaos, with bodies slumped on the ground in what remained of a restaurant, clothing smeared in blood. Palestinians rushed to the scene, searching for survivors and rushing the injured into ambulances.
A boy in a green hoodie spotted his father amongst the rubble, sprawled on the ground with blood staining his neck and shirt. The boy cried for “Dad!” again and again as his father’s lifeless body was taken away, in a video obtained by CNN. In another such clip, a young child’s body lies on the street near several adults, his pink backpack still strapped to his back.
Among the dead was also journalist Yehya Sobeih, according to Sabaq 24, the outlet he worked for. Sobeih had just celebrated the birth of his daughter a day earlier, according to his Instagram account.
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
On Wednesday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said Israel was moving into what he described as “Phase 2” of the plan for “decisive defeat.”
“We must be proactive. We must take the initiative. We must be the ones to act first – before the enemy does,” Zamir said, according to a statement from the IDF. “We do not have the right to be passive. We do not have the privilege to stop or retreat. That is a privilege we simply do not have – and it will not happen.”
More than 2,500 Palestinians have been killed since Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on March 18, according to figures provided by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
On Monday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said 13 of its 29 clinics in Gaza have shut down. The ones that are still functioning have “limited capabilities,” it said. Meanwhile, 21 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are only partially functioning, according to the UN health agency.
Israel’s blockade, which has prevented the entry of food and medicine, is pushing the Gaza’s ravaged healthcare system towards collapse, aid agencies have warned.
Near the site of the latest Israeli strike, a woman hugged her crying daughter, saying that all her daughter’s friends were killed.
“My friend Leen is gone, my friend Yousra is gone, my friend Miral is gone,” the daughter said as tears streamed down her face.
The UN’s humanitarian agency (OCHA) warned Tuesday of a “deepening catastrophe” in Gaza amid the blockade.
“OCHA stresses that under international humanitarian law, civilians must be protected, and their essential needs – including food, shelter, water and healthcare – must be met, wherever they are in Gaza and whether they move or stay,” OCHA said.","['Kareem Khadder', 'Abeer Salman', 'Hira Humayun', 'Ibrahim Dahman']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/us-shutting-down-office-of-palestinian-affairs,US is shutting down Office of Palestinian Affairs and merging it into its embassy in Jerusalem,2025-05-06 20:14:51,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is closing the Office of Palestinian Affairs and merging it into the US embassy in Jerusalem, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday.
“This decision will restore the first Trump term framework of a unified US diplomatic mission in Israel’s capital that reports to the US ambassador to Israel,” Bruce said at a department briefing. “Ambassador (Mike) Huckabee will take the steps necessary to implement the merger over the coming weeks.”
Bruce claimed the closure of the office “is not a reflection on any outreach or commitment to outreach to the people at the West Bank or to Gaza.”
“It really is actually very similar to what’s happening here with the bureaus, with our reorganization. It is making sure that the issues that are important are all working together right, are not segmented out so that the interests of the embassy – very, very much like the interests of our foreign aid and other actions – can work together in the Bureau as one entity,” she said.
Still, it appeared to be a further downgrading of relations with the Palestinian people, especially since the announcement comes one day after Israel approved plans to expand its war in Gaza.
On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “One thing will be clear: there will be no in-and-out.” After more than 18 months of war, Netanyahu said the population of Gaza will be displaced to the south “to protect them.” Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Monday that “we are finally going to conquer the Gaza Strip.”
Last week, Trump said he told Netanyahu, “We’ve got to be good to Gaza.” But, so far, there has been no action to back up the rhetoric, with Israel’s complete blockade of Gaza entering its third month. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, more than 52,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began.
In the first Trump administration, the US shuttered the consulate general in Jerusalem and reopened it as the Palestinian Affairs Unit, which operated under the embassy.
The consulate gave the Palestinian Authority a dedicated US representative and a direct line to Washington without going through the US ambassador to Israel. Such an arrangement, where Israelis and Palestinians had separate lines to Washington, was viewed as critical for the US to operate as an impartial broker between the two sides, especially in times of conflict.
But David Friedman, Trump’s first ambassador to Israel during his first term and a staunch advocate of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, closed the consulate. The move made Friedman, who has openly criticized the idea of a Palestinian state, the primary intermediary for the Palestinians to talk to Washington.
The Biden administration did not reopen the consulate general despite claiming it would work to do so.
Rubio’s move to close the Office of Palestinian Affairs appears to be a further step in sidelining the Palestinian ability to engage directly with the US government, especially through Huckabee, who has said in the past that “there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.”","['Jennifer Hansler', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/middleeast/analysis-netanyahu-war-over-hostage-deal-latam-intl,Netanyahu chooses war - and his political survival - as Israelis demand hostage deal,2025-05-06 19:01:50,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kept up appearances for nearly 19 months: Freeing the hostages and defeating Hamas, he insisted, stood equally atop the pyramid of Israel’s war goals.
Even as members of his right-wing governing coalition threatened to topple his government if he agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Even as he himself threw up eleventh-hour obstacles to reaching such a deal. And even as evidence mounted that Israel’s military operations had both directly and indirectly led to the killing of Israeli hostages. Amid all those contradictions, Netanyahu insisted both objectives were just as important.
But not anymore. Now, Netanyahu is unabashedly prioritizing war – and the survival of his government – over the fate of 59 hostages still in Gaza and the will of most Israelis.
A week after calling the defeat of Israel’s enemies the “supreme objective” of the war, Netanyahu is turning that rhetoric into action: calling up tens of thousands of reservists to pummel, seize and occupy large swaths of Gaza – what the prime minister calls the “final moves” against Hamas.
Israeli officials say the plan won’t be implemented immediately, giving Hamas at least another week-and-a-half to agree to another limited hostage and ceasefire deal on Israel’s terms – with some insisting that is the government’s preference. The deadline, they say, is the conclusion of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region next week. But such a deal is unlikely to materialize in that timeframe and these are no longer idle threats.
The right-wing ministers who have sabotaged previous ceasefire deals and long called for conquering Gaza are now celebrating, viewing the newly approved plans as the first step toward their vision of occupying and ultimately annexing the enclave. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich now vows that there will be “no retreat from the territories we have conquered, not even in exchange for the hostages.”
For Netanyahu, that means political security – taking Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s repeated threats to leave the government and force new elections off the table, keeping him in the prime minister’s office.
It also means going against the will of a clear majority of Israelis – 56% according to Israel’s Kan 11 and 69% according to Channel 12 – who support a deal to end the war in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages.
Hamas has repeatedly said it is open to such an all-in-one deal, hoping to salvage its position of power in Gaza, but the Israeli government has rejected any end to the war that leaves the group armed and governing the strip.
For the families of Israeli hostages, Netanyahu’s decision has been a gut punch, one they fear won’t just delay the return of their loved ones but actively endanger them.
“It seems the government has placed defeating Hamas above rescuing and returning the hostages, because doing so would require stopping the war,” Anat Angrest, the mother of captive Israeli soldier Matan Angrest, told Haaretz. “Ministers are sending soldiers into harm’s way and putting the hostages at further risk, when all that was needed was a pause to develop a real strategic plan. What’s happening now is a war fueled by revenge and conquest, not by a genuine desire to save lives.”
“It doesn’t reflect the will of the people, or the Jewish heart,” she said.
The expanded Israeli assault in Gaza won’t just bring the risk to the hostages of more Israeli bombs. Hamas has repeatedly said it will execute hostages if Israeli forces close in on their positions, a threat it carried out last August in murdering six of them. Israel’s plan to displace nearly all of Gaza’s population to its southern part while continuing to starve the rest of the strip of humanitarian aid could also endanger the hostages’ access to the already limited food they are given.
Notably, in the days before the Israeli security cabinet greenlit the expanded war effort, Netanyahu’s wife and close adviser, Sara, sought to downplay the number of living hostages. When Netanyahu said last week that “up to 24” hostages held in Gaza are still alive, his wife chimed in: “Fewer.” Her comments reflected what Israeli officials told CNN are “grave concerns” about three of those hostages – the same language previously used to refer to hostages who were eventually confirmed dead.
For the people of Gaza, Netanyahu’s decision threatens catastrophe beyond the dire humanitarian crisis already gripping the besieged territory. The expanded Israeli assault guarantees another mass forced displacement of Palestinians, more death and destruction and the continued use of starvation as a weapon of war.
Even as Netanyahu’s decision to prioritize destroying Hamas over the fate of the remaining hostages becomes clear, the Israeli military’s ability to achieve its aims vis-à-vis the group remain uncertain.
The factors that have allowed Hamas to survive and stay in power in Gaza after nearly 19 months of war still remain, and Israeli national security analysts remain skeptical that tens of thousands of additional troops will fundamentally change the dynamics of the conflict. Sending them with the goal of occupying large swaths of Gaza could drive up Israeli military casualties, with the risk of bogging the military down for years in a counterinsurgency morass.
Perhaps that is why Netanyahu did not barrel headfirst down the path he has now chosen.
Trump’s return to power allowed Netanyahu to shed the guardrails imposed on him by President Joe Biden during the first 15 months of the war. But even as Trump and his administration made clear they would not seek to constrain Israel’s military actions in Gaza, Netanyahu did not immediately pursue the expanded war his right-wing allies have been clamoring for.
But in a fulcrum moment, he has now chosen – a decision that will shake the Gaza Strip, forever altering the fate of more than 2 million Palestinians and 59 hostages.",['Jeremy Diamond'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/middleeast/israeli-unprecedented-evacuation-warning-yemen-airport-intl,Israel says it has ‘fully’ disabled Yemen’s main airport in escalating strikes on Houthi rebels,2025-05-06 00:00:00,"Israel struck multiple sites in Yemen’s capital Sanaa Tuesday, including the main airport, which the Israeli military said has now been “fully” disabled.
“A short while ago, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) fighter jets struck and dismantled Houthi terrorist infrastructure at the main airport in Sanaa, fully disabling the airport,” the Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday, adding that several major power stations in the Sanaa area were also hit.
The IDF said fighter jets “dismantled” the airport within 15 minutes and struck a concrete plant.
At least one person was killed and three others were injured in the airport attack, according to the Houthi-run Ministry of Health.
Israel’s military earlier issued an evacuation warning for Yemen’s international airport in Sanaa, marking the first time the IDF has put out such a notification in Yemen, more than 1,000 miles from Israel.
Houthi leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti vowed retaliation against the Israelis, telling Al Arabiya TV on Tuesday: “We will meet escalation with escalation, and there are still multiple targets within the Zionist entity, sensitive targets, which will cost the Zionist entity large losses.”
Tuesday’s attacks mark a significant escalation between the Iran-backed Houthis and the Israeli military that has spiraled rapidly in recent days.
On Sunday, a Houthi ballistic missile penetrated Israel’s air defenses and hit near Ben Gurion international airport after several attempts to intercept the missile failed, the IDF said. The strike appears to be the first time Israel’s international airport has been successfully targeted by the group.
The Iran-backed Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in response to Israel’s offensive in Gaza, and warned it would “impose a comprehensive air blockade” on Israel by “repeatedly targeting airports,” especially Ben Gurion. It called on international airlines to plan accordingly and cancel all scheduled flights to Israeli airports.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then vowed retaliation.
“We acted before, we will act in the future too. I can’t elaborate all of that. The US, in coordination with us, is also operating against them. It’s not ‘one and done’ - but there will be hits,” he said in a video address posted on social media Sunday.
In a post to X later, he also promised a response to Iran: “Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.”
That retaliation began on Monday when Israeli forces carried out a series of strikes against the port in Hodeidah – Yemen’s second largest – and a nearby cement factory, killing at least one person and injuring another 35 people, according to the Ministry of Health.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that 20 of its fighter jets took part in that mission – the first Israeli strikes in Yemen in months – hitting dozens of Houthi targets in Hodeidah and surrounding areas. The Houthi-run TV channel Al-Masirah said the port of Hodeidah was hit at least six times and confirmed the attack on the nearby cement factory.
The IDF claimed the Hodeidah seaport “is used for the transfer of Iranian weapons, equipment for military purposes, and other terror-related need(s).”
Israel struck Sanaa international airport in December, killing at least three people and injuring 30 others, according to the Houthi-run al-Masirah satellite television network.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/05/middleeast/israel-gaza-expansion-hnk-intl,Israel vows to escalate war with new plan to ‘conquer’ Gaza,2025-05-05 06:52:50,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the population of Gaza will be displaced to the south after his security cabinet approved an expanded military operation in the enclave that a minister described as a plan to “conquer” the territory.
The vote on Sunday came hours after the military said it would mobilize tens of thousands of reservists, strengthening its capacity to operate in the besieged Palestinian territory.
“One thing will be clear: there will be no in-and-out,” Netanyahu said in a Monday video message posted on X. “We’ll call up reserves to come, hold territory — we’re not going to enter and then exit the area, only to carry out raids afterward. That’s not the plan. The intention is the opposite.”
“There will be a movement of the population to protect them,” Netanyahu said of the “intensified operation.”
Less than 24 hours later, an Israeli strike on a school compound housing displaced people in central Gaza killed at least 20 people, according to officials at the nearby Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The Israeli military said they struck a Hamas command and control center on Tuesday, saying that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming uninvolved civilians.”
A senior Israeli security official earlier said the operation in Gaza, called “Gideon’s Chariots,” was unanimously approved by the security cabinet with the aim of subduing Hamas and securing the release of all hostages.
The plan would be implemented after US President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East next week to “provide a window of opportunity” for a hostage deal, the official added.
“If no hostage deal is reached, Operation Gideon’s Chariots will begin with full force and will not stop until all its objectives are achieved.”
The plan then, is to displace Gaza’s entire population to the south of the enclave, following which the total the blockade of humanitarian aid may be lifted, the official said, adding that the military “will remain in every area it captures.”
“In any temporary or permanent agreement, Israel will not evacuate the security buffer zone around Gaza, which is intended to protect Israeli communities and prevent arms smuggling to Hamas,” the official said.
“We are on the eve of a major entry into Gaza based on the recommendation of the General Staff,” Netanyahu said in his video message, adding that military officials told him it was time to “start the final moves.”
‘Highest goal’
The “highest goal” of the expanding operation in Gaza, according to the military’s top spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, is returning the hostages, not defeating Hamas. His comments come just a week after Netanyahu said the war’s “supreme goal” is the defeat of Israel’s enemies, not the return of hostages.
“The top goal of the operation is the return of the hostages. After that — the collapse of Hamas rule, its defeat and subjugation — but first and foremost, the return of the hostages,” Defrin said responding to a question about his message to hostage families.
The military spokesman faced swift condemnation from Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who said Defrin was “confused into thinking that the army is above the political echelon.”
Hostage families were quick to condemn the announcement of the expansion of the war, fearing that the Israeli government is prioritizing the defeat of Hamas over securing a deal to return Israeli hostages – and endangering them through the expanded military operations.
Asked if the US approves of the new Israeli plan, National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told CNN: “The President has made clear the consequences Hamas will face if it continues to hold hostages, including American Edan Alexander, and the bodies of four Americans. Hamas bears sole responsibility for this conflict, and for the resumption of hostilities.”
Hamas said on Tuesday that Israel’s plan represents “a clear decision to sacrifice” hostages in the strip.
It also reproduces “the cycle of failure (Israel) began eighteen months ago, without achieving any of its declared goals,” the militant group said in a statement, adding that Hamas “will not be intimidated” by the Israeli military’s “threats and plans.”
Gaza annexation not ruled out
Meanwhile, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Monday that “we are finally going to conquer the Gaza Strip.”
Annexing Gaza is a possibility, and once the military expands its operations in the enclave, it will not pull back – even if Hamas agrees to a new hostage deal, he said at a conference in Jerusalem, referring to the security cabinet decision on Sunday.
“Once we conquer and stay – we can talk about sovereignty (over Gaza). But I didn’t demand that it be included in the war’s objectives,” he added. “Once the maneuver begins – there will be no withdrawal from the territories we’ve captured, not even in exchange for hostages.”
Smotrich primarily handles the country’s finances, but he sits on the security cabinet and holds significant sway over Netanyahu, who relies on his support to keep the government from collapsing.
More than 2,400 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since mid-March when Israel launched a wave of deadly strikes, shattering a ceasefire, which had been in place for nearly two months. More than 52,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
The expansion of the fighting will be gradual to give a chance for a renewed ceasefire and hostage release deal before US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region in mid-May, the officials said. Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar next week, but there is currently no stop planned in Israel.
The UN raised concern with the latest expansion plan, saying it would lead to more civilians being killed.
“I can tell you that the Secretary General is alarmed by these reports of Israeli plans to expand ground operations and prolong its military presence in Gaza,” Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General, Farhan Haq told reporters on Monday.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot strongly criticized Israel’s plan, calling it “not acceptable” in a radio interview Tuesday morning.
“The urgent need is obviously the ceasefire. But it’s also unhindered access for humanitarian aid. The Palestinians living there are massively lacking humanitarian aid from the Gaza Strip. And then there’s the release of the Hamas hostages, of course,” Barrot said on RTL Radio.
China also said Tuesday it was “highly concerned” about the developments.
“China opposes Israel’s ongoing military actions in Gaza and hopes all parties continuously and effectively implement the ceasefire agreement and return to the right track for a political resolution of the issue,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a news briefing
New aid mechanism
An Israeli blockade of all humanitarian aid into the strip is now in its ninth week.
Israel says it cut off the entry of humanitarian aid to pressure Hamas to release hostages. But international organizations say its actions violate international law and risks creating a man-made famine, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war – a war crime.
The cabinet also discussed allowing the resumption of aid deliveries into Gaza under a new framework which was approved, but has not yet been implemented, according to one of the sources.
Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan 11, reported that a confrontation had broken out during Sunday’s meeting over the resumption of aid deliveries with two far-right members of the cabinet, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and settlements minister Orit Strook opposed to any resumption of aid and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir arguing Israel was obligated to facilitate them under international law.
According to one of the source who spoke to CNN, the Israeli media reports about the arguments over the aid “are not wrong.”
United States and Israeli officials are discussing a mechanism to deliver aid to Gaza that bypasses Hamas, an Israeli source familiar with the matter and a State Department official told CNN. The official said an announcement could be made “in the coming days.”
The delivery mechanism in the works is intended to allow aid to reach the Palestinian population with safeguards to ensure it is not diverted by Hamas or Islamic Jihad, according to a State Department spokesperson.
An unnamed private foundation would manage the aid mechanism and the delivery of the humanitarian supplies into Gaza, the spokesperson said.
The US expects the United Nations and international aid organizations to work with the framework of the foundation’s mechanism to ensure that supplies do not reach Hamas, the spokesperson said.
In a statement on Monday, Hamas criticized the new framework, saying: “We reject turning aid into a tool for political blackmail and support the international position that rejects any arrangements that do not respect humanitarian principles.”
Aid agencies working in the occupied Palestinian territory also rejected the new framework on Sunday, saying the plan appeared “designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items” and would fail to ensure aid reached Gaza’s most vulnerable residents.
“The UN Secretary-General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator have made clear that we will not participate in any scheme that does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality,” the groups said in a joint statement.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/05/middleeast/israel-strikes-houthi-yemen-telaviv-airport-intl-latam,"Israel strikes targets in Yemen for the first time in months, a day after Houthis attack Tel Aviv airport",2025-05-05 00:00:00,"Israel struck targets in Yemen on Monday night, the Israeli military said, one day after the Iranian backed Houthis fired a ballistic missile that hit Israel’s main airport.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had vowed to retaliate at a time and place of Israel’s choosing and promised Sunday that a powerful response would be coming.
The Houthi-run Ministry of Health said at least one person had been killed and another 35 injured in an Israeli strike on a cement factory in Bajil, east of Hodeidah.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that 20 of its fighter jets took part in the mission – the first Israeli strikes in Yemen in months – hitting dozens of Houthi targets in Hodeidah and surrounding areas.
“The seaport in Hodeidah is used for the transfer of Iranian weapons, equipment for military purposes, and other terror-related need,” the IDF said in a statement. Israeli fighter jets also targeted a cement factory east of Hodeidah for its use in the construction of tunnels and military infrastructure, the IDF said.
The Houthi-run TV channel Al-Masirah said the port of Hodeidah was hit at least six times, as well as confirming the attack on the nearby cement factory.
The Israeli military made several attempts to intercept the ballistic missile fired at Tel Aviv on Sunday, but failed to bring it down, resulting in a successful attack on the heavily defended facility. The strike appeared to be the first time Israel’s international airport has been successfully targeted by the group.
On Sunday night, the Iran-backed rebel group said it would “impose a comprehensive air blockade” on Israel by “repeatedly targeting airports,” especially Ben Gurion. It called on international airlines to plan accordingly and cancel all scheduled flights to Israeli airports.
Netanyahu convened Israel’s security cabinet Sunday afternoon to discuss the incident.
“We acted before, we will act in the future too,” said Netanyahu in a video posted on social media. “I can’t elaborate on all of that. The US, in coordination with us, is also operating against them. It’s not ‘one and done,’” he said.
Israel has launched several rounds of strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including the targeting of a power plant and maritime ports in January. The US military has carried out far more extensive strikes on targets in Yemen in recent months, aiming to weaken the group and disrupt Houthi attacks on US Navy ships and commercial vessels operating in the Middle East.
But the attacks have done little to stem the launch of Houthi projectiles at Israel or at US warships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb, two of the world’s most strategically important waterways. The Houthis launched ballistic missiles at Israel over three consecutive days, culminating in the strike that hit the airport. Last week, a US F/A-18 fighter jet fell off an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea after the ship made a hard turn to evade a Houthi attack.
“The whole world is being challenged by the Houthis,” Netanyahu told Cypriot President Nikos Christodoudiles on Sunday. “We will not tolerate it. We will take very strong action against them. And we always remember that they act with their patron Iran’s direction and support.”
The Houthis warned on Sunday night that they could strike again and would “impose a comprehensive air blockade” on Israel by “repeatedly targeting airports,” especially Ben Gurion. It called on international airlines to plan accordingly and cancel all scheduled flights to Israeli airports.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Dana Karni', 'Kareem El Damanhoury']",en

Flights were halted at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv for about 30 minutes on Sunday morning after a missile landed in the airport’s vicinity, following what the Israeli military said were “several attempts” at interception. “The results of the interception are under review,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
The military fired its long-range Arrow interceptor at the incoming missile, an IDF spokesperson said. The US also has an advanced THAAD anti-missile system deployed in Israel.
The Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out “in rejection of (Israel’s) crime of genocide” against the people of Gaza.
The group later warned it could strike again and would “impose a comprehensive air blockade” on Israel by “repeatedly targeting airports,” especially Ben Gurion. It called on international airlines to plan accordingly and cancel all scheduled flights to Israeli airports.
The strike appears to be the first time Israel’s international airport has been successfully targeted by the group.
“The American and Israeli defense systems failed to intercept the missile aimed at Ben Gurion Airport,” Yahya Saree, the group’s spokesperson, said in a statement, adding that the airport was targeted with a “hypersonic ballistic missile.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis.
“We acted before, we will act in the future too. I can’t elaborate all of that. The US, in coordination with us, is also operating against them. It’s not ‘one and done’ - but there will be hits,” he said in a video address posted on social media.
In a post to X later, he also promised a response to Iran: “Israel will respond to the Houthi attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our choosing, to their Iranian terror masters.”
Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that the response would be “sevenfold.”
Iran’s defense minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said Iran would respond to any attack on it. State-affiliated Mehr News quoted him as saying, “if we are attacked or a war is imposed on us, we will respond with might.”
“We will attack their interests and their bases, and we will not be reluctant and will not see any limits in this regard,” Nasirzadeh told Iranian TV, according to Mehr. “We are not enemies of our neighboring countries, and they are our brothers, but American bases on their soil will be our targets.”
Israel’s security cabinet convened on Sunday afternoon to discuss the incident, according to an Israeli official.
The incident marks a major security breach at one of the most heavily protected sites in the country, and is likely to raise questions about Israel’s ability to intercept such attacks despite its vaunted missile defense system.
An initial IDF inquiry found no malfunction with any systems or procedures, but a “technical issue” with the interceptor itself, that was launched toward the Houthi missile, the military said.
Trains to and from the airport were also halted and police asked the public to refrain from arriving in the area.
Pictures from the scene showed debris from the impact of the missile on the grounds of the airport, littering the road toward the main terminal. A video shared on social media appeared to show the impact of the missile at the airport and a cloud of black smoke rising from the strike.
Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings suspend flights to and from Tel Aviv until after Tuesday, May 6, a Lufthansa Group spokesperson told CNN.
‘You have to take this threat seriously’
Amir Bar Shalom, the military affairs analyst for Israel’s Army Radio, said the missile showed both tremendous accuracy and the ability to penetrate Israel’s air defenses.
“They were very accurate, and to be very accurate if you’re launching from 2,000 kilometers, it’s impressive,” Bar Shalom told CNN. “And you have to take this threat seriously. We have to check whether it’s our mistake or whether we have a new kind of threat here.”
Iran is developing long-range missiles capable of maneuvering to evade air defenses, Bar Shalom said, though it remains unclear whether such advanced technology has been transferred to the Houthis. He added that the military will analyze all of the aspects of the failed interception attempts, including when sensors detected the incoming projectile, which systems identified it, and how close interceptors came to the missile.
“There are so many parameters that may be relevant to the result that have to be analyzed,” he said.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack, calling Yemen “the twin of Palestine, as it continues to defy the most brutal forces of oppression, refusing submission or defeat despite the aggression it faces.”
Sunday’s strike marks the third consecutive day of missile launches from Yemen toward Israel, according to the IDF.
The Houthis claim their hypersonic missiles have stealth technology, a range of 2,150 kilometers (1,335 miles), high maneuverability and can travel up to speeds of Mach 16.
Since Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza started in October 2023, the country has come under fire from missiles and rockets from Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, who claim to strike Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. Almost all of the projectiles have been intercepted by Israel’s air defenses.
But in December, a Houthi missile hit Israel’s commercial capital Tel Aviv after a failed interception, leading to more than a dozen injuries. The Houthis said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile labeled “Palestine 2” at an Israeli military target in the Jaffa area. And in July, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv – the first such strike on the city by the group.
Israel has launched several strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including the targeting of a power plant and maritime ports in January.
But the US military has carried out far more extensive strikes on targets in Yemen in recent weeks, aiming to weaken the group, whose attacks on Red Sea shipping have significantly disrupted global trade.
The campaign is also aimed at stopping launches targeting Israel, as well as commercial and US Navy vessels operating in the Middle East. Early last month, the cost of US the effort had approached $1 billion in just three weeks, including the deployment of B-2 stealth bombers and the use of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of high-end munitions.
But it has largely failed to disrupt the Houthis’ ability to launch ballistic missiles against Israel. The country’s vaunted missile defense system routinely intercepts the launches, but some have gotten through.","['Tamar Michaelis', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

The call-up follows reports that the Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir on Friday presented a plan to intensify pressure on Palestinian militant group Hamas to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan 11, reported that Zamir’s plan included evacuating Palestinian civilians from northern and central Gaza ahead of expanded operations in those areas, mirroring tactics used earlier this year in southern Gaza’s Rafah.
Citing unnamed officials, Kan 11 said Netanyahu’s Security Cabinet was expected to approve the plan Sunday.
Speaking on Sunday, Zamir said: “This week we’re issuing tens of thousands of orders to our reservists in order to intensify and expand our operation in Gaza. We’re increasing the pressure in order to return our people and defeat Hamas.”
The IDF chief added that the military would “operate in additional areas and destroy all infrastructures above and under the ground.”
The news has prompted concern among families of the 59 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Most of the hostages were taken during Hamas’ deadly October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked 18 months of Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 50,000 people in Gaza.
In what it described as “an urgent and heartfelt” appeal, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters warned Saturday that “any escalation in the fighting will put the hostages — both the living and the deceased — in immediate danger.”
“The vast majority of the Israeli public views the return of the hostages as the nation’s highest moral priority,” it added.
Negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages have been stalled for weeks.
Talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly collapsed. Hamas is demanding a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel has accused Hamas of rejecting “reasonable offers.”
Hope for a diplomatic resolution appeared to dim further over the weekend as Netanyahu accused Qatari mediators of “playing both sides” in the negotiations and calling on the Gulf state to “decide if it’s on the side of civilization or if it’s on the side of Hamas barbarism,” claiming Israel is fighting “a just war with just means” in Gaza.
It’s unclear what prompted Netanyahu’s claim, but the statement follows reports in Israeli media that Qatar had pressured Hamas to reject an Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire deal.
Qatar dismissed the claim Sunday, calling the accusation a distortion of its diplomatic efforts and accused Israel of using humanitarian aid as a “tool of political coercion” as a total Israeli blockade of aid deliveries to the Palestinian enclave enters its third month. “Is this truly the model of ‘civilization’ being promoted?” its Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari wrote in a post on X.
“A legitimate question must be raised: Were the releases of no fewer than 138 hostages achieved through so called ‘just’ military operations, or through the very mediation that is now being unjustly criticized and undermined?” he added.
On Thursday, Netanyahu said explicitly for the first time that defeating Israel’s enemies was more important than securing the release of the remaining hostages, in remarks that drew a backlash from representatives of their families. Previously, he had described defeating Hamas and securing the release of the hostages as the primary goals of Israel’s war in Gaza.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s Office announced Saturday it was rescheduling Netanyahu’s May 7-11 visit to Azerbaijan “to a later date.”
Citing an “intense diplomatic and security schedule,” it said the change came following “developments in Gaza and Syria.”

In a statement issued Friday, Hamas said it would carry out more executions against “every criminal we can reach in the next two days.”
Since last week, armed gangs have increasingly taken to the streets of Gaza City, going after some of the remaining food supplies and challenging Hamas’ control of the territory, according to CNN journalists in Gaza. Hamas claims some of these “criminal gangs” are collaborating with Israel.
“A warning has been issued - those who ignore it bear full responsibility,” Hamas said in the statement.
The executions – and Hamas’ vow that more will follow – is a stark reminder that the militant group, even weakened after more than 18 months of war, retains power in Gaza.
As food supplies have begun running out across the coastal enclave, Palestinians have grown increasingly desperate to find whatever food remains. On Wednesday night, thousands of people stormed a UN facility and multiple warehouses across Gaza City looking for remnants of meals, such as flour or canned food, according to a journalist who witnessed one such incident.
Hamas claimed some of the alleged looters were collaborating with Israel.
On Saturday, Hamas’ Ministry of Interior and National Security claimed that “a group of outlaws, collaborators with the occupation, has emerged to threaten the lives of citizens, spreading fear and chaos in some neighborhoods, and attacking public and private properties.”
Scenes of mass hunger have become far more common as Gaza’s population of 2.1 million Palestinians edges closer to famine. Israel imposed a complete blockade of Gaza on March 2, stopping the supplies of humanitarian aid, including food and medicine, into the besieged territory.
Dr. Ahmad Al-Farra, the head of the pediatric department at Nasser Medical Complex in Gaza warned over the weekend that “a looming health catastrophe is threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands.”
“We are facing the danger of a massive wave of deaths due to malnutrition if the current humanitarian crisis continues unaddressed,” he told CNN. Earlier Saturday, two-month-old Janan Saleh Al-Sakkafi died due to malnutrition at Al-Rantisi Hospital, Dr. Munir Al Barsh, Director General of the Ministry of Health in Gaza told CNN.
The US State Department said an announcement regarding humanitarian aid is possible “in the coming days” that would allow much-needed food and medicine to reach the Palestinian population without being diverted by Hamas or Islamic Jihad.
“Safeguards are finally in place. Israel remains secure, Hamas empty handed, and Gazans with access to critical aid,” a State Department spokesperson said.
The spokesperson described the project as an element of “creative thinking” but did not provide any details on how it would function in Gaza. An unnamed private foundation would manage the aid mechanism and the delivery of the humanitarian supplies into Gaza, the spokesperson said.
Since taking power in the enclave in 2007, Hamas has executed dozens of suspects including some accused of collaborating with Israel.
The Israeli military, meanwhile, is pressing on with chief of staff Eyal Zamir saying on Sunday that the IDF would issue “tens of thousands” of orders to reservists in the coming week, to ramp up its offensive in the enclave.

The official said an announcement could be made “in the coming days.”
The initiative to deliver aid comes as a total Israeli blockade of aid deliveries to the Palestinian enclave approaches its third month, and after US President Donald Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late last month that “we’ve got to be good to Gaza.”
The delivery mechanism in the works would allow aid to reach the Palestinian population with safeguards to ensure it is not diverted by Hamas or Islamic Jihad, according to a State Department spokesperson.
An unnamed private foundation would manage the aid mechanism and the delivery of the humanitarian supplies into Gaza, the spokesperson said.
“Safeguards are finally in place. Israel remains secure, Hamas empty handed, and Gazans with access to critical aid,” the spokesperson said, adding that the mechanism “helps fulfill President Trump’s commitment” to help Gaza. The spokesperson described the project as an element of “creative thinking” but did not provide any details on how it would function in the besieged enclave.
The US expects the United Nations and international aid organizations to work with the framework of the foundation’s mechanism in order to ensure that supplies do not reach Hamas, the spokesperson said.
Axios initially reported on Saturday that the US, Israel and representatives of a new international foundation are close to an agreement on how to resume the delivery of aid, citing two anonymous Israeli and US sources
The Israeli source who spoke to CNN would not say if a deal was imminent.
For two months, Israel has carried out a total siege of Gaza, refusing to allow in a single truck of humanitarian aid or commercial goods – the longest period Israel has imposed such a total blockade.
Israel says it cut off the entry of humanitarian aid to pressure Hamas to release hostages. But international organizations say its actions violate international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war – a war crime.
While taking questions from reporters late last month, Trump was asked whether the topic of aid for Gaza came up during his recent conversation with Netanyahu.
“Gaza came up,” Trump responded. “And I said: ‘We’ve got to be good to Gaza’ because people are – those people are suffering.”
“There’s a very big need for medicine, food and medicine. We’re taking care of it,” he said.
Late last year, ahead of the total Israeli blockade of Gaza, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned that the risk of famine persists across the entire territory, projecting that 16% of the population would be in famine by April.
‘A massive wave of deaths’
Dr. Ahmad Al-Farra, the head of the pediatric department at Nasser Medical Complex in Gaza warned on Saturday that “a looming health catastrophe is threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands” in the enclave.
“We are facing the danger of a massive wave of deaths due to malnutrition if the current humanitarian crisis continues unaddressed,” he told CNN.
Earlier Saturday, two-month-old Janan Saleh Al-Sakkafi died due to malnutrition at Al-Rantisi Hospital, Dr. Munir Al Barsh, Director General of the Ministry of Health in Gaza told CNN.
The World Food Programme says it is ready to surge enough aid into Gaza to feed the entire population of about two million for up to two months. UNRWA, the main UN agency supporting Palestinians, said it has nearly 3,000 trucks filled with aid waiting to cross into Gaza. Both need Israel to lift its blockade to get that aid in.
Netanyahu is under intense pressure from far-right members of his fragile governing coalition to continue fighting in Gaza and withhold aid as a means of pressure against Hamas.
Last month, Defense Minister Israel Katz said his government is working on a mechanism “through civilian companies” to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza at a “later” stage, prompting a severe backlash from extremist politicians.
“As long as our hostages are languishing in tunnels, there is absolutely no reason for even a single gram of food or any aid to enter Gaza,” Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir said at the time.
Katz later clarified that “no humanitarian aid is set to enter Gaza.”
In early April, COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages policy for the Palestinian territories and the flow of aid into the strip, announced a “new authorization mechanism” designed to “prevent Hamas infiltration into humanitarian organizations.”
“The mechanism is designed to support aid organizations, enhance oversight and accountability, and ensure that assistance reaches the civilian population in need, rather than being diverted and stolen by Hamas,” it said, without giving any details as to when it would be implemented.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/03/middleeast/these-kibbutzniks-used-to-believe-in-peace-with-palestinians-their-views-now-echo-israels-rightward-shift,These kibbutzniks used to believe in peace with Palestinians. Their views now echo Israel’s rightward shift,2025-05-03 04:01:51,"Sitting inside her new apartment in kibbutz Tzora, a leafy community just west of Jerusalem, Almog Holot ran her fingers over a bowl of crystals as the wind chime on her balcony blew in the breeze.
Eighteen months ago, she spent 12 hours gripping the handle of her safe room door in kibbutz Nirim as she, along with her mother and her children – then 6 and 8 years old – hid from Hamas militants, who threw grenades at their house, ransacked their home and terrorized their community.
Five people were killed and another five were kidnapped from Holot’s kibbutz on October 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militant groups launched a coordinated terror attack on Israeli communities and military posts, killing 1,200 and kidnapping 251 people.
Holot and her family survived. But her belief in peace did not.
“I don’t know what I believe in, but it’s not peace,” she told CNN.
Holot and her ex-husband, who is from Nirim, a kibbutz about 2 kilometers (approximately 1.2 miles) from the Gaza border, had decided to raise their family there, believing it was the best place for their children.
“Kibbutzes are like paradise on earth in many ways,” she said. “You live in a community where money is not the most important thing… people know each other, people care about each other, and people help each other.”
While her children grew up “in a reality in which in every single second of every single day, a rocket might hit them,” Holot said that before October 7, such attacks were rare.
“Most of the time it was really peaceful,” she said. “My children knew to answer people that the people who threw rockets were just Hamas, and most of the people in Gaza are good – just like them.”
Like many residents of kibbutzim – or communal settlements – located near the Gaza border, Holot says she holds left-leaning political views. And like many so-called kibbutzniks, she too believed in, and advocated for, peace with Palestinians.
People from outside of her kibbutz used to tell her that her views were “naïve,” she said. Now she believes they were right.
“I can no longer say that 95% of them (Palestinians) want to live in peace,” Holot said, adding that many in her community were “surprised” by the attacks, but not because of the actions of Hamas.
“We thought (Gazans) were like us. And it turned out, no, they’re not,” she said, alleging that “common people of Gaza” were involved in the looting of October 7 and expressed support for the attacks.
It’s an attitude that Avida Bachar, from nearby kibbutz Be’eri also shares. Bachar lost his wife, his teenage son and his right leg in the attacks, in which 100 of the kibbutz’s 1,100 residents were killed.
Prior to October 7, Bachar believed that Palestinians and Israelis could coexist.
“I thought that we want to live together… like two states… we can work together, we can live together,” he told CNN.
Now, he believes that Israel should raze Gaza and take complete control of it.
“We have to take the border, to move the border, and put potatoes and peanut fields there (in Gaza), until the sea. That is a different system, and we have to do it,” he said, acknowledging that his support of such an extreme idea would have surprised him prior to the war.
Such shifts in attitudes aren’t surprising for survivors of extreme trauma, said Merav Roth, a Haifa-based clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst.
Roth, who established a philanthropic long-term therapeutic organization for the victims of October 7 and who regularly works with survivors and returned hostages, told CNN that survivors rely on disassociation as a coping mechanism.
“It takes most of your energy just to survive mentally. And that’s why they don’t have spare energy to think of ‘the other,’” Roth said, adding that they are often in “fight or flight” mode and react in “binary, primitive ways.”
“When you’re in chaos, when you’re intimidated, when you’re threatened, you split the world into two: total good and total bad… and revenge is an illusion of becoming strong,” Roth said.
So, by operating with a mentality of “I don’t want to think about them. I don’t want to solve anything,’” Roth said, survivors are able to create a sense of protection for themselves.
It’s the type of protection Holot seeks for herself and her children, who both suffer from PTSD.
While Holot said that she does not support US President Donald Trump or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu politically, their call to relocate Palestinians in Gaza to third countries – a “voluntary” emigration plan approved by Israel’s cabinet in March that critics say could amount to ethnic cleansing – has given her pause.
“Would I want to get up tomorrow morning, wake up and see that all the people in Gaza disappeared and everything is peaceful? Yes. On the same note, I would like to get up tomorrow morning and find out that all the people in Gaza want peace,” she said, before adding: “But do I think (either) is possible? No.”
A shift to the right
In the 1990s and 2000s, the conflict was a dividing line between left and right, split 50-50 along political lines, according to Tamar Hermann, a public opinion and polling expert at the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), a Jerusalem-based think tank.
Holot and Bachar’s views mirror a wider shift in attitudes among Israeli Jews to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the idea of a two-state solution since October 7.
But over the years, Jewish Israeli society has made a significant shift to the right, with only 13% of that population now self-identifying as on the left, compared with 30% in the center, and 55-60% on the right, Hermann said.
While the right remains staunchly against a Palestinian state, a view that has only hardened since the war began, the center is now much more aligned with the right than it used to be, she said.
But the major shift has been among those on the left, who used to support a two-state solution but now see a Palestinian state as unfeasible anytime soon, she said.
Meanwhile, across all political lines, very few Jewish Israelis (5%) believe that Hamas would end its struggle against Israel even if there was a Palestinian state, according to an IDI opinion poll conducted 13 months ago.
Holot, who still identifies as on the left, said she believes left-wing activists outside of Israel who demonstrate for a “Free Palestine” do not fully understand Hamas’ ideological stance, instead only focusing on images of Palestinian suffering.
Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 52,000 people since October 2023 – among them 16,000 children – according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. 2,100 Palestinians have been killed since Israel reignited its aerial and ground campaign last month, breaking a two-month-old ceasefire.
“I’m very sad for this reality, but I’m very stable about knowing that it’s not our fault and their leaders brought it upon them,” Holot said, echoing a wider national sentiment. Nearly all Jewish Israelis (94.5%) believe that Hamas bears a great deal of responsibility for the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to the IDI poll.
“Murderousness is infectious, aggression is infectious,” Roth said of the vicious cycle of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
But Roth, who believes in a two-state solution, still has hope for peace. She said some of the returned hostages and survivors she’s worked with have told her: “’I will fight for the two-state solution. We still need peace.”
“They are amazing, and it’s inspiring,” Roth said. “They keep their higher selves, even after all that they went through.”
‘The only reality I knew’
In between lectures, 21-year-old Gili Avidor walks under trees on the perimeter of the Tel Aviv University campus. Like the survivors – and much of Israeli society – she, too, has undergone a profound personal and political transformation since October 7.
But her story is very different than most.
After her former boyfriend was killed at the Nova music festival in southern Israel, she too, wanted revenge. “We were first loves. It was really difficult,” Avidor told CNN last month.
“I remember telling my sister that I want everyone in Gaza dead,” said Avidor.
“Now I am ashamed and frightened of the fact that these words came out of my mouth,” Avidor, who describes herself as being from a right-wing family, said: “I was completely inside the Israeli narrative. That’s the only reality I knew.”
As Israel escalated its war on Gaza, Avidor said something changed for her.
“I thought, there is probably some other girl on the other side of the gate in Gaza that is feeling exactly what I feel, that someone she loved got killed, and revenge is the answer…(but) revenge is what makes such things to happen in the first place.”
Avidor began to engage with left-wing activist groups that support Palestinian self-determination and volunteered as a “protective presence” for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, who have suffered an increasing number of attacks by Jewish settlers since the start of the war.
It’s hard to stand up to your own society, she said, adding that individual and collective trauma has been weaponized to empower extremists to perpetuate the conflict and dehumanize Palestinians.
Still, she remains committed to a different way forward, saying that it is her “duty” to advocate for “human beliefs in this very dark time.”
Avidor acknowledges that she did not experience the first-hand trauma that many kibbutzniks did, and expresses deep sympathy for them.
“I can understand that people who endure such a trauma (flips) their life upside-down,” Avidor said.
But she pushed back on the idea that October 7 is a reason for them to stop seeing a path forward to peace with Palestinians.
“I mean, they say: ‘Okay, we were the the good Jews who helped you and took you to the hospital when you’re sick…’ but now they strip them from their humanity,” she said.
“The notion that human rights is something that people need to gain and to be thankful for? That makes me angry. And I think they’re hypocrites,” Avidor added.
Not every survivor has faltered in their vision for peace.
At her father’s graveside at kibbutz Nir Oz several weeks ago, Sharone Lifschitz read one of his poems to friends and family attending his headstone-setting ceremony, as the sound of bombs exploded a mile away in Gaza.
“In the poem, he makes a small wish, and the little prayer is that there will be a week in which no Palestinians will be killed,” Lifschitz told CNN. It was written in the 1980s, during the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising.
Oded Lifschitz, a lifelong peace activist, was kidnapped age 83 from the kibbutz on October 7, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed weeks after her capture.
“My father used to say that peace is inevitable, that just the question is how much blood is shed before that,” Lifschitz told CNN.
She and her mother continue to embody Oded’s ideology, saying that peace with Palestinians is the only way forward.
Roth, the psychologist, believes Israel’s most “severe danger as a society is if we become the atrocity we experience.”
“This will be really the victory of Hamas, if the Israeli people will lose their values, their higher selves, their morality, (capacity for) seeing the other,” she said.
Back in kibbutz Tzora, Holot says she still holds liberal values, and is focused on healing herself and her children.
“I don’t want to teach them bad things about humanity. So, I prepare them to keep thinking that Hamas is bad and the people are good… even if I don’t feel it myself,” she said.",['Kara Fox'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/europe/gaza-flotilla-ship-sos-intl-hkn,Aid ship bound for Gaza catches fire after alleged Israeli drone attack off Malta,2025-05-02 04:06:39,"A Gaza-bound activist aid ship caught fire and issued an SOS, after what its organizers claimed was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters in the early hours of Friday.
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), which is campaigning to end Israel’s blockade of Gaza, told CNN activists were aboard its ship carrying humanitarian aid when the alleged attack happened just after midnight local time (6 p.m. ET Thursday).
The group is yet to provide evidence that the drone was Israeli, while the Israeli military has declined to comment on the alleged attack.
“There is a hole in the vessel right now and the ship is sinking,” Yasemin Acar, the coalition’s press officer, told CNN by phone from Malta on Friday morning.
Malta’s government said the 68-foot-long ship was carrying 16 people – 12 crew members and four civilian passengers. But FFC earlier gave CNN a higher figure of 30 people on board the vessel.
The Armed Forces of Malta confirmed there was a fire on a ship that was later extinguished. “We are monitoring the situation closely,” a spokesperson told CNN, adding that there were no injuries onboard.
In a later statement, Malta’s government said a tug boat had been sent to assist the vessel.
“All crew were confirmed safe but refused to board the tug. Assistance was provided to support interior firefighting efforts,” the Maltese government statement said.
The ship, the Conscience, was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists were due to board before it departed for Gaza, more than 1,000 miles away, but had not made it into port, the group said.
FFC told CNN that climate activist Greta Thunberg and retired US Army Colonel Mary Ann Wright were among those who were expected to board the vessel in Malta, but were not onboard at the time of the fire.
“Volunteers from over 21 countries traveled to Malta to board the mission to Gaza, including prominent figures,” FFC said in a statement.
Thiago Avila, the flotilla’s lead organizer, told CNN that he and other activists took a boat out to the flotilla to try and provide assistance to their colleagues late Friday afternoon, but Maltese sea guards surrounding the vessel prevented them from getting near it.
“We will try to go back again tomorrow morning,” Avila said.
When asked by CNN for comment, the Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta said the vessel and the crew are secure, and that the ship remains outside territorial waters and is being monitored by authorities.
Late Friday, the FFC said the flotilla was still trying to enter Maltese territorial waters, but was being prevented by the coast guard. It urged the Maltese government to provide safe passage for the boat, citing the risk of a new attack.
‘Craziest thing in the world’
Speaking to Reuters from Malta, Thunberg said she was part of the group that was supposed to board the boat and “continue the voyage towards Gaza, which is one of many attempts to open up a humanitarian corridor and to do our part to keep trying to break Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza,” adding that “for two months now, not a single bottle of water has entered Gaza, and it’s a systematic starvation of 2 million people.”
The activist said that the ship is currently at anchor, as moving it risks water flooding in. “If it were to move, too much water would come in, and it would sink,” she said.
“What is certain is that we human rights activists will continue to do everything in our power to do our part.”
Speaking to CNN from Malta, Wright said activists “were ready to get on the boat. Anyone could have been on the boat,” adding that there are currently Turkish and Azerbaijan citizens on the ship.
“We didn’t even think that this would happen. It’s the craziest thing in the world. The ship was in an anchor there, waiting for us to come. Who would send drones to bomb a ship that is anchoring off Malta?” Wright said, adding that “this should be a warning to all European countries.”
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition describes itself on its website as an international network of pro-Palestinian activists working to end Israel’s blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid to the besieged enclave by taking direct, non-violent action.
Gaza has been under Israeli military siege since the October 7, 2023, Hamas deadly attacks on Israel.
Israel imposed a full humanitarian blockade of Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said this week its warehouses are now empty; soup kitchens that are still running are severely rationing their last stocks; and what little food remains in Gaza’s markets is being sold for exorbitant prices that most cannot afford.
Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, said on X that she “received a distressed call from the people of the Freedom Flotilla that is carrying essential food and medicine to the starving Gaza population.”
“I call on concerned state authorities, including maritime authorities, to support the ship and its crew as needed. I trust the competent authorities will also ascertain the facts and intervene appropriately,” she said.
Loud explosions
FFC said it had been operating under a media blackout over the mission because it wanted to avoid potential sabotage.
“Our vessel is 17 kilometers off the shores of Malta right now in international waters, and they have been subjected to a drone attack twice,” said Acar, adding that the generators at the front of the vessel were the apparent target.
The group pointed the finger of blame at Israel, without providing evidence. “Israeli ambassadors must be summoned and answer to violations of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel in international waters,” FFC said in its statement.
An Israeli Air Force C-130 Hercules was picked up leaving Israel early Thursday afternoon and flying to Malta, according to flight-tracking website ADS-B Exchange. The Hercules did not land at Malta’s international airport, the data shows, but the cargo aircraft did fly at a relatively low altitude - below 5,000 feet - over eastern Malta for an extended period of time. The Hercules flew over several hours before the Freedom Flotilla Coalition says their vessel came under attack. The plane returned to Israel about seven hours later, flight-tracking data shows.
The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the flight-tracking data.
In 2010, Israel attacked a flotilla in international waters and carrying humanitarian supplies for Gaza, killing nine people and sparking outrage around the world. A tenth person died of wounds sustained in the attack in 2014, after spending four years in a coma.
Video the coalition posted on its X account appeared to show a fire burning on a ship, as well as smoke. The sound of two loud explosions can also be heard in a separate video clip. CNN is unable to independently verify the videos.
Footage shared on social media and verified by FCC activists shows passengers on the boat walking through smoke that appeared to have filled the inside of the vessel. Photos onboard the ship also show large holes in the structure, much of which is charred and covered in soot.
Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member, told CNN that the photos are consistent with two smaller blast munitions being used.","['Kathleen Magramo', 'Abeer Salman', 'Todd Symons', 'Martin Goillandeau']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/middleeast/netanyahu-calls-defeating-israels-enemies-the-supreme-objective-intl,"Netanyahu calls defeating Israel’s enemies the ‘supreme objective,’ not freeing hostages",2025-05-01 13:52:56,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that defeating Israel’s enemies is more important than securing the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.
While the prime minister acknowledged that freeing the 59 remaining hostages is a “very important goal,” he described Israel’s fight against its enemies as the “supreme objective” of the war.
“We have many objectives, many goals in this war. We want to bring back all of our hostages,” Netanyahu said. “That is a very important goal. In war, there is a supreme objective. And that supreme objective is victory over our enemies. And that is what we will achieve.”
Netanyahu’s remarks, which came on Israel’s Independence Day, mark the first time that the prime minister has explicitly described returning the hostages as a secondary goal of the war. He has previously described defeating Hamas and securing the release of the hostages as the primary goals of Israel’s war in Gaza.
His comments drew a backlash from representatives of hostage families.
“Prime minister, the return of the hostages is not ‘less’ important – it is the supreme goal that should guide the government of Israel,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. “The families of the hostages are concerned.”
Netanyahu’s comments put him at odds with the majority of the Israeli public, which overwhelmingly supports a deal to release all the hostages and end the war in Gaza, according to recent opinion polls.
But it puts the prime minister in the company of Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who recently made similar comments.
“We need to tell the truth – bringing back the hostages is not the most important goal. It is, of course, a very, very, very, very important goal,” Smotrich said last week. “But anyone who wants to destroy Hamas and eliminate the possibility of another October 7 must understand that in Gaza, there can’t be a situation where Hamas remains present and intact.”
Members of Netanyahu’s governing coalition have been pushing the prime minister to continue fighting. Senior Israeli officials have warned for weeks that the military will intensify its operations in Gaza if there is no ceasefire agreement with Hamas.
A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Netanyahu is set to meet with senior defense officials on Friday as Israel prepares to expand the war.
Israel says its bombardment of Gaza, coupled with a two-month total blockade, is an attempt to put pressure on Hamas to make concessions in ceasefire negotiations. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and said it cannot continue to rule the enclave.
Pressure mounts on Netanyahu
This is the second time this week that Netanyahu has faced backlash from the families of hostages. On Monday, his wife Sara was overheard on a microphone saying that “fewer” than 24 hostages are still alive in Gaza. The remark outraged families and prompted demands for clarity on what the government knows about their loved ones’ fate, as well as questions on why the prime minister’s wife has sensitive information about their loved ones that they do not.
“You sowed indescribable panic in the hearts of the families of the hostages – families already living in agonizing uncertainty,” the forum said in a statement. “If there is intelligence or new information regarding the condition of our loved ones, we demand full disclosure.”
Israel has publicly said in recent weeks that it believes up to 24 of the 59 remaining hostages are still alive. Sara Netanyahu’s claim appears to be an indication that the government may have information that some of the 24 hostages have died.
Israeli officials told CNN last week there are “grave concerns” about three of the hostages but would not say whether Israel knows for certain that they are dead. For months, Israeli officials used the same language to refer to hostages Shiri Bibas and her two children, whose bodies were returned in the most recent ceasefire.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Eugenia Yosef']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/30/middleeast/gaza-edges-closer-to-famine-amid-israels-total-blockade-intl,Gaza edges closer to famine as Israel’s total blockade nears its third month,2025-04-30 09:50:57,"Sitting inside her fly-infested tent in Gaza City, Iman Rajab sifts clumps of flour through a sieve, over and over again.
She found the half-bag of flour in a garbage dumpster. It is crawling with pests and shows clear signs of contamination. But it’s still Rajab’s best hope for keeping her six children fed and alive. So she sifts the flour once more to make bread.
“My kids are vomiting after they eat it. It smells horrible,” Rajab says of the bread it produces. “But what else can I do? What will I feed my children if not this?”
She is one of hundreds of thousands of parents in Gaza struggling to feed their children as the war-torn Palestinian enclave barrels towards full-blown and entirely man-made famine.
For nearly two months, Israel has carried out a total siege of Gaza, refusing to allow in a single truck of humanitarian aid or commercial goods – the longest period Israel has imposed such a total blockade.
Israel says it cut off the entry of humanitarian aid to pressure Hamas to release hostages. But international organizations say its actions violate international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war – a war crime.
The impact is clear: The World Food Programme (WFP) announced this week that its warehouses are now barren; the soup kitchens that are still running are severely rationing their last stocks; and what little food remains in Gaza’s markets is now being sold for exorbitant prices that most cannot afford. A simple bag of flour now costs the equivalent of $100, several people told CNN.
On Wednesday night, thousands of desperate residents stormed a United Nations school and several warehouses in Gaza City, searching for food and basic supplies. In the Rimal neighborhood of southern Gaza City, men, women, and children attempted to force their way into the buildings, hoping to find remnants of supplies such as flour and canned goods.
Others looked for tents, tarps, and batteries while gunfire was heard as armed men attempted to repel people from entering the facilities. Elsewhere in the city, people stormed warehouses in several neighborhoods.
Cases of acute child malnutrition in Gaza are rapidly rising, one of the telltale signs of impending famine. Nearly 3,700 children were diagnosed last month, an 82% increase from February, according to the UN.
Five-year-old Usama al-Raqab has already lost 8 lbs in the last month, now weighing just 20 lbs, according to his mother. According to the World Health Organization, the median weight for a healthy 5-year-old boy is about 40 lbs.
He has several pre-existing medical conditions – including a pancreatic disorder and respiratory issues – which require a diet rich in fats and proteins to stay healthy. Those foods have become almost completely unavailable as Israel’s siege approaches its third month.
Usama’s skin now sticks to his bones, and his mother says he can barely walk.
“I have to carry him everywhere. He can only manage to walk from the tent to the bathroom and nothing more,” she says.
When his mother takes off his clothes to bathe him, he winces in pain. Every movement is painful in his condition.
Food deliveries blocked just outside of Gaza
The aid organizations that were once the answer to a food crisis that has roiled Gaza for much of this nearly 19-month-long war are now also out of answers.
Standing in an empty warehouse, the WFP’s emergency coordinator in Gaza Yasmin Maydhane said the organization’s supplies have been “depleted.”
“We are in a position now where over 400,000 people that were receiving assistance from our hot meal kitchens – which is the last lifeline for the population – is in itself grinding to a halt,” she said.
If Israel would only open the gates to Gaza, the WFP says it is ready to surge enough aid into Gaza to feed the entire population for up to two months. UNRWA, the main UN agency supporting Palestinians, said it has nearly 3,000 trucks filled with aid waiting to cross into Gaza. Both need Israel to lift its blockade to get that aid in.
As conditions in Gaza spiral, Israel has offered no indication so far that it is planning any action to avert all-out famine.
Israel’s European allies – including France, Germany and the United Kingdom –have issued increasingly urgent calls for it to allow the entry of humanitarian aid – with one notable exception. Unlike last year, when former US President Joe Biden’s administration pressured Israel repeatedly to facilitate the entry of more aid into Gaza, President Donald Trump’s administration is backing Israel’s blockade.
The White House’s National Security Council has issued statements supportive of Israel’s control of the flow of humanitarian aid as a bargaining chip to compel Hamas to release more hostages. And last week, the newly appointed US ambassador to Israel rejected appeals from humanitarian officials to pressure Israel to open the crossings.
“What I would like to suggest is that we work together on putting the pressure where it really belongs: on Hamas,” Ambassador Mike Huckabee said, calling on Hamas to agree to another hostage release deal. “When that happens and hostages are released, which is an urgent matter for all of us, then we hope that that humanitarian aid will flow and flow freely.”
But Gaza’s starving civilians are running out of time.
At a soup kitchen in al-Nuseirat in central Gaza last Friday, hundreds of Palestinians waited in line in the scorching sun for the only meal most of them will eat that day.
Sitting on the ground, an elderly woman named Aisha shields her head from the sun with the pot she hopes will be filled with food. She feels sick – her head feels like it is melting, she says.
“We are starving, tired, and weary of this life,” Aisha says, her voice weak with fatigue. “There is no food, no nothing. Death is easier than this life.”
Young and the old crowd towards the front of the line, pots and bowls raised high. The one meal a day from this charitable association has become their only lifeline – but the exhausting routine of hours spent standing in line for meager sustenance is pushing him and many others to the brink.
“This pot – how can it feed eight people?” Abu Subhi Hararah shouts, unable to contain his frustration. “Who should I feed – my wife, my son, or the elderly?
“Our children are dying from war, from bombings at schools, tents and homes,” he cries. “Have mercy on us. We are searching for a morsel of food.”","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Abeer Salman']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/30/middleeast/syria-condemns-israeli-strikes-intl-latam,Israel conducts rare strike outside Damascus amid sectarian tensions in Syria,2025-05-01 00:00:16,"Syria strongly condemned foreign intervention in the country following a rare Israeli strike near Damascus on Wednesday amid deadly sectarian violence.
Syria said the Israeli strike killed at least one security officer and injured several other people.
Earlier on Wednesday Israel’s military said it had carried out a strike on the outskirts of the Syrian capital saying it was targeting an “extremist group” that had attacked the Druze community, a religious minority in the country.
In a joint statement on Wednesday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz said the operation in the town of Sahnaya, southwest of Damascus, was a “warning action” against an unidentified armed group “preparing to continue attacking the Druze population.”
Syria’s foreign ministry reacted saying it had an “unwavering commitment” to protecting all Syrian people, including the “honorable Druze community.”
According to Syria’s state news agency SANA, government forces launched a wide-scale operation in the area surrounding Sahnaya to arrest “outlawed gangs” after an unidentified armed group attacked a Syrian government checkpoint late Tuesday, wounding three officers.
Other groups simultaneously opened fire on civilian and security vehicles in nearby areas. Recent violence left at least 11 people dead and dozens injured.
On Thursday, top Syrian Druze leader Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri called for the “immediate intervention” of international peacekeeping forces “for the swift protection of an innocent, defenseless population.” He described the violence against his community as a “campaign of extermination” carried by what he described as Syrian government “affiliated extremist gangs.”
Without referring to Hijri’s statement, Syria’s foreign ministry immediately rejected calls for foreign interference.
“Any call for foreign intervention – under any pretext or slogan – only leads to further deterioration and division,” the ministry said in a statement. “Those who call for such intervention bear historical, moral, and political responsibility before the Syrian people and history itself.”
Foreign interventions, it added, “are often pursued at the expense of national interests and serve agendas unrelated to the aspirations of the Syrian people.”
‘Stay away from calls for revenge’
Syria’s top Sunni-Muslim cleric Osama al-Rifai has called on all Syrians to keep calm and not escalate the situation.
“Everyone must… stay away from calls for revenge and retaliation, and allow justice to take its course,” Rifai said regarding the “recent events,” in Sahnaya, in a statement on Wednesday as cited by SANA.
Two local journalists in Damascus told CNN on condition of anonymity due to security concerns that the clashes in Sahnaya broke out between fighters loyal to the Syrian government and militiamen from the Druze minority.
Since the fall of the Bashar Al Assad regime, Israel has positioned itself as the protector of Syria’s Druze, an Arab community that follows an offshoot of Islam and is predominantly present across Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Wary of a new regime led by former jihadists, a small minority of Druze have welcomed Israel’s overtures, but many others have publicly denounced them.
A sizeable number of Druze live within Israel’s internationally recognized borders, have Israeli citizenship and serve in its military. A large Syrian-Druze population is also present in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and most have rejected Israeli citizenship and do not traditionally serve in the Israeli military. Within Syria, many Druze live in the south of the country, parts of which Israel declared a buffer zone after Assad’s fall.
“On this Memorial Day for Israel’s fallen soldiers, as we honor the Druze community’s contribution to Israel’s security, we stress our commitment to protect their brethren in Syria,” the joint statement added.
Israeli officials also urged the Syrian government to prevent harm to the Druze community.
On Wednesday evening, the Israeli military said that three Syrian Druze citizens were evacuated into Israel for medical treatment after they were injured in Syria.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen has expressed his deep concern “at unacceptable violence in Syria especially in suburbs of Damascus,” and ” alarmed at reports of Israeli attacks,” in a statement on Wednesday
” These attacks must stop,” Pedersen said and called for “full respect of Syria’s sovereignty.”
The situation on the ground remains volatile, with residents telling CNN that Sahnaya continues to witness sporadic clashes and intermittent attacks by unidentified local groups involving mortar fire and medium-caliber machine guns. Efforts by government officials and community mediators to de-escalate are ongoing, multiple residents in the area told CNN.","['Eyad Kourdi', 'Dana Karni', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq']",en

Israel is seeking international assistance to fight the fires, as the defense minister says the country is “in a time of national emergency.”
“This is perhaps the largest fire ever in the country,” Jerusalem District Fire Department Commander Shmulik Friedman told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. He warned that winds in excess of 60 miles an hour are expected “in the near future,” dramatically increasing the risk of the fires.
The fire forced authorities to close Route 1, the major road connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Wednesday – Israel’s Memorial Day.
Videos from social media show people walking along the highway with thick smoke filling the air.
Hours later, emergency workers ran amongst long lines of abandoned cars on the highway, looking for anyone who may still be in their cars, according to a video from United Hatzalah, an emergency response organization.
“We don’t know at this time what caused the fire. We don’t have even a bit of a clue. We are still not dealing with it,” Friedman said. “We are far from control.”
The fire is active on multiple fronts, authorities said, with one area concentrated around the town of Neve Shalom, located about 15 miles west of Jerusalem. In one clip, the flames can be seen next to the road along a packed section of highway.
The Israeli police has said they apprehend a “suspect attempting to ignite fire in open field.”
“Officers from the Jerusalem District arrested a resident of East Jerusalem who was caught in the act of attempting to set fire to a field in the southern part of the city,” Police Spokesperson’s Unit said in a statement on Wednesday.
“A search of the suspect’s belongings uncovered a lighter, cotton wool, and additional flammable materials,” it added saying the suspect is man in his fifties from Umm Tuba, which is a Palestinian Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar held a marathon of talks with other countries to bring in firefighting aircraft, according to his office, particularly nearby countries in Europe. Three aircraft from Italy and Macedonia will arrive “as soon as possible,” the National Security Council said in a statement.
At least ten communities in the area have been evacuated, authorities said.
“We are in a time of national emergency, and all available forces must be mobilized to save lives and bring the fires under control,” said Defense Minister Israel Katz Wednesday.
There are about 120 teams fighting the fire, Israel’s Fire and Rescue Services said, as well as 12 firefighting aircraft and helicopters.
More than a dozen people have arrived at two separate hospitals as a result of the fire, according to Shamir Medical Center and Kaplan Medical Center.
Meanwhile, Hadassah Medical Center on the outskirts of Jerusalem asked the public not to come to the hospital “unless absolutely necessary.” The hospital has begun evacuating patients who do not need to be hospitalized, even as it prepares to accept new patients who may have suffered injuries in the fires.
The fire is in approximately the same location as a similar blaze last week.","['Dana Karni', 'Lauren Izso']",en

Assad Al-Nsasrah went missing after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attacked a convoy of emergency vehicles in Gaza on March 23. He was part of a crew who were trying to find a missing PRCS ambulance in Rafah, southern Gaza, which was later discovered to also have been targeted by the IDF.
The IDF attacks killed 15 people in three separate shootings, including 8 PRCS medics. Their vehicles were clearly marked with the PRCS insignia. The IDF buried the bodies of those killed in a mass grave, along with the vehicles they had been traveling in.
According to PRCS medic Munther Abed – who was sitting in the back of the ambulance en route to the scene – the crew was suddenly targeted with heavy, direct gunfire by Israeli forces. He told CNN that he witnessed the IDF’s burial of the bodies and vehicles, seeing bulldozers dig a large pit, crush the vehicles and pile them into the hole.
Photos and videos of the grave’s excavation reviewed by CNN showed some of the PRCS paramedics pictured in photos were buried in their uniforms emblazoned with the group’s emblem and reflective stripes. Others were still wearing their blue latex gloves, indicating that they were on duty and prepared to respond to distress calls.
It took the PRCS three weeks to learn that Al-Nsasrah had been detained by the IDF. Prior to this, his fate had been unknown since the attack.
On Tuesday, the PRCS posted a video to X of the medic reuniting with his colleagues, wiping away tears as he hugged them one by one.
“Today, the Israeli occupation forces released our colleague Asaad (Al-Nsasrah), a survivor of the massacre targeting medical teams in Rafah,” the PRCS wrote in a separate X post.
“He had been detained for 37 days and arrived in poor health at Al-Amal Hospital, affiliated with the association in Khan Younis, where he underwent the necessary medical examinations,” the humanitarian organization continued.
Though the Israeli military had initially claimed without evidence that some of the vehicles it targeted were moving suspiciously, and that some of those killed were Hamas members, it later said “professional failures” led to the killings.
According to the IDF, troops opened fire on what they believed to be a “tangible threat” amid what the military called an “operational misunderstanding.”
Videos showed that the convoy of marked ambulances were driving with headlights and flashing emergency lights on. Aid agencies also denied that any Hamas militants were among those killed.
“The IDF regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians,” the IDF said in a statement published earlier this month. CNN has reached out to the military for comment on Al-Nsasrah’s release.

The raid occurred in the city of Jenin, where Samoudi’s son told CNN the Israeli military came in at 5 a.m. and took the 58-year-old journalist to an undisclosed location.
Samoudi “underwent a field interrogation” by Israeli forces for 30 minutes, Mohammad Samoudi told CNN, saying they had searched the house and destroyed some of its contents.
In addition to writing for the Palestinian Al-Quds newspaper, Samoudi routinely worked with international news outlets, including CNN, Al-Jazeera, Reuters, and others.
In May 2022, Samoudi was working near the entrance to the Jenin refugee camp when Israeli forces shot and killed Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Samoudi was shot and injured in the gunfire.
The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate condemned the raid and Samoudi’s arrest.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Samoudi was “identified with the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization” and suspect of transferring funds to the group, but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.
One of the most well-known Palestinian journalists in the West Bank, Samoudi has worked with international news organizations for decades as a local producer and fixer. In his long career as a journalist, he had never previously faced such an accusation, including when he became a witness to the high-profile killing of his colleague, Abu Akleh.
The IDF said Samoudi has been transferred to Israeli security forces “for further treatment.”
Samoudi is the latest of dozens Palestinian journalists to be arrested by Israeli forces over the past 18 months. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Israel has arrested at least 84 journalists in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023.","['Kareem Khadder', 'Abeer Salman']",en

The hearings will look at Israel’s obligations, both as a member of the United Nations and as an occupying power, toward the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The aid agency provides education, healthcare and social services to nearly 6 million Palestinian refugees across the Middle East.
The hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which began in The Hague on Monday following a request by the UN General Assembly, are scheduled to last all week, with 40 countries, including the United States, set to speak as part of the proceedings. The ICJ will issue an advisory opinion about Israel’s obligations at a later stage, after the hearings conclude.
The court’s advisory opinions have no binding force, but they carry tremendous significance. They are “often an instrument of preventive diplomacy and help to keep the peace,” according to the court. They also help interpret and shape international law.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called it “another shameful proceeding” designed to delegitimize his country. Speaking at a press conference in Jerusalem in lieu of the hearing on Monday, Sa’ar accused UNRWA of being “an organization that is infested with Hamas terrorists.” He said Israel had submitted its written position but would not take part in “this circus.”
UNRWA has repeatedly denied these accusations in the past, saying there is “absolutely no ground for a blanket description of ‘the institution as a whole’ being ‘totally infiltrated.’”
At the opening of the hearings on Monday, the UN’s legal counsel said Israel had a clear obligation as an occupying force to allow and facilitate humanitarian aid for Gazans.
“In the specific context of the current situation in the occupied Palestinian Territories, these obligations entail allowing all relevant UN entities to carry out activities for the benefit of the local population,” Elinor Hammarskjöld said.
Ammar Hijazi, the Palestinian representative at the hearing, said “there can be no doubt about the court’s jurisdiction in these proceedings,” pointing to two previous ICJ cases involving Israel.
In January 2024, the ICJ ruled that Israel must take “all measures” to prevent a genocide in Gaza. Then in June, it said in an advisory opinion that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza is illegal.
“Israel is starving, killing and displacing Palestinians, while also targeting and blocking humanitarian organizations trying to save their lives,” Hijazi said.
Amir Weissbord, an official with Israel’s foreign ministry, claimed on Monday that “1,462 UNRWA workers in Gaza are confirmed terrorists,” which he said was based on intelligence. Israel has not provided evidence to support the accusation of such a high number. Weissbord said the number would be even higher once Israel began looking into UNRWA’s female employees.
After the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks, Israel alleged that 12 of UNRWA’s 14,000 staffers in Gaza were involved in the assault. A subsequent UN investigation found that nine employees “may have” been involved in the attack. UNRWA said at the time that their contracts had been terminated.
‘Campaign to discredit UNRWA’
In October, Israel’s parliament passed a law banning UNRWA from activity within Israel and revoking the 1967 treaty that allowed the agency to carry out its mission. The ban was expected to severely restrict UNRWA’s ability to operate in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said at the time that the move violated international law and was “the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role toward providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine refugees.”
In early April, Israel raided six UNRWA schools in East Jerusalem, ordering them to close within 30 days. Lazzarini promised that the agency would not be cowed by Israel’s actions.
“UNRWA is committed to stay & deliver education and other basic services to Palestine Refugees in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in accordance with the General Assembly resolution mandated to the Agency,” he said on social media.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been pushing to dismantle UNRWA well before the October 7 attacks, arguing that the agency perpetuates the Palestinian “refugee problem.” UNRWA’s definition of Palestinian refugees includes the descendants of those Palestinians who were forced out of their homes during Israel’s creation in 1948. Israeli officials have rejected that definition, arguing that descendants don’t qualify as refugees and thus don’t have the right to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel.","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/27/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-strike-israel-latam-intl/index.html,Israeli airstrike rocks southern Beirut after military issues evacuation warning,2025-04-27 16:51:01,"An Israeli airstrike rocked southern Beirut on Sunday soon after the military issued an evacuation warning for the Lebanese capital.
Footage from Reuters showed a huge plume of smoke rising from the area shortly after 6:00 p.m. (11 a.m. ET).
The target of the strike was a Hezbollah facility in Beirut which stored precision missiles, according to a joint statement from Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
Hezbollah has not yet commented on the matter.
The Lebanese Civil Defense said it extinguished fires caused by the Israeli strike and recorded no injuries.
The attack came after Israel Defense Forces spokesman Avichay Adraee advised civilians to evacuate from the Hadath neighborhood. Adraee said Hezbollah was using facilities in the area and said civilians should move 300 meters away.
Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned Israel for attacking the area and urged the US and France to “compel Israel to immediately halt its aggressions.”
Since a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect in November, the IDF has carried out a number of strikes, regularly targeting southern Lebanon. The IDF says these strikes have targeted Hezbollah militants and facilities.
Strikes in the capital of Beirut have been rare however. On April 1, the IDF struck a target in the Dahieh area in Beirut. Only days before, the Israeli military had conducted another attack in Beirut.
UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis said Sunday’s strike “generated panic and fear of renewed violence among those desperate for a return to normalcy.” She urged all sides to stop actions that could undermine the ceasefire.
Before the November ceasefire, Israel and Hezbollah exchanged cross-border attacks for 13 months in the wake of the Gaza war. Israel launched an intense ground and aerial campaign in September last year, eliminating the militant group’s leader.","['Oren Liebermann', 'Charbel Mallo', 'Michael Rios', 'Eyad Kourdi', 'Dana Karni']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/middleeast/un-wfp-gaza-food-israel-intl/index.html,UN runs out of food in Gaza two months after Israel’s total blockade,2025-04-25 00:00:00,"The United Nations’ World Food Programme has run out of food in Gaza, the organization said Friday, almost two months into Israel’s humanitarian blockade of the besieged enclave.
The agency says it delivered its final food stocks to kitchens in Gaza on Friday, and the kitchens are expected to deplete their supplies in the coming days.
“For weeks, hot meal kitchens have been the only consistent source of food assistance for people in Gaza,” the World Food Programme (WFP) said in a statement. “Despite reaching just half the population with only 25% of daily food needs, they have provided a critical lifeline.”
Israel imposed a humanitarian blockade of Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory. Israel says the blockade, along with the military’s expansion of its bombardment of Gaza, is intended to pressure Hamas to accept a US-backed ceasefire proposal.
“If we do not see progress in the return of the hostages, we will expand our activity into a more intense and significant operation,” said Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir during a visit to Gaza Thursday.
The US has made clear that it will not push Israel to allow in more humanitarian aid. On Monday, Mike Hucakbee, the new US Ambassador to Israel, said a UN World Health Organization official asked him to put pressure on Israel to open the borders.
“How about we put the pressure where it really belongs – on Hamas,” Huckabee said on social media.
The blockade has worsened Gaza’s already dire humanitarian situation, with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) warning earlier this month of imminent famine. The PRCS said most essential supplies, such as flour, sugar, and cooking oil, had run out of Gaza’s markets.
More than 116,000 metric tons of food is waiting at aid corridors outside of Gaza, ready to be brought in by WFP and its partners, the organization said. The supplies – which are enough to feed one million people for up to four months, WFP said – can enter as soon as the borders reopen.
“The situation inside the Gaza Strip has once again reached a breaking point: people are running out of ways to cope, and the fragile gains made during the short ceasefire have unravelled,” WFP said.","['Sharon Brathwaite', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/us/yale-university-protest-israel-gaza/index.html,Palestinian supporters confront far-right Israeli security minister as he leaves an event near Yale,2025-04-23 19:20:33,"Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was confronted by some pro-Palestinian demonstrators Wednesday night in New Haven, Connecticut, according to a statement and videos shared by Ben Gvir’s office.
“Water bottles were thrown” at Ben Gvir, his office said, when the far-right minister exited a building in front of protesters following a speech he gave at Shabtai, a private Jewish society at Yale that’s not officially affiliated with the university.
The videos show dozens of demonstrators shouting and chanting at the minister as he exits, smiling and waving at the protesters. “Minister Ben Gvir refused to leave the scene and made a V sign at them, as a sign of victory,” his office said.
Photos published on social media show a water bottle apparently being thrown at Ben Gvir and a group of people surrounding him.
In one video, an item that was apparently thrown is heard hitting the ground. People standing next to Ben Gvir shout “whoa” as they realize items are being thrown.
Ben Gvir was not injured and is in “good health,” his office said.
In a separate video viewed by CNN, at least one person is seen being detained by police. CNN has reached out to New Haven police for comment and details about detainments or arrests.
When the event began earlier Wednesday evening, protesters crowded the sidewalk outside the gated building while chanting “Free Palestine,” “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “Yale, your hands are red.” As attendees made their way into the venue, protesters yelled “shame” repeatedly and booed.
Mitchell Dubin, a Yale senior and member of the Shabtai Society, told CNN “Shabtai does not seek to legitimize or delegitimize world leaders. Instead, it provides a space where ideas are interrogated with rigor, policies are challenged with integrity, and civil discourse is preserved even under strain.”
Renewed protests have spread at college campuses this spring over Israel’s handling of its war in Gaza.
The war started after Hamas, the militant group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, killed 1,200 people in Israel in a series of gruesome attacks and took hundreds of others hostage in October 2023.
But international groups have said Israel’s attacks in Gaza have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians – mostly women and children – and caused an ongoing humanitarian crisis.
Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also gathered at Yale University on Tuesday night to protest Ben Gvir’s visit.
A Yale spokesperson told CNN an “unregistered group” of 200 people not “affiliated with any recognized student organization” gathered Tuesday and set up eight tents in Beinecke Plaza, a central square on Yale’s campus.
The group disbanded at 11 p.m. Tuesday after “university officials articulated Yale’s policies and the consequences of violating them” and offered a final warning, the Yale spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
Protesters were given cards with QR codes that linked to Yale University’s policies for peaceable assembly, such as keeping everyone physically safe, not blocking entrances and exits and not disrupting the university’s operations.
Some students who were warned by campus officials in previous incidents that violated school policy were given written notices and “are subject to immediate disciplinary action,” the spokesperson said. But the university didn’t say how many received such notices.
Tuesday’s protest came shortly after the group met with Yale officials to discuss recent campus policy violations and were “warned that further violations would jeopardize the group’s privileges,” the university said.
Yale has since revoked the group’s status as a registered student organization, as officials say they are also investigating concerns about “disturbing antisemitic conduct at (Tuesday’s) gathering,” the university said Wednesday.
“Yale condemns antisemitism and will hold those who violate our policies accountable through our disciplinary processes,” the statement said.
A statement from Ben Gvir’s office said the protesters were there “in an attempt to prevent a speech by the Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir – who was invited to speak at the venue.”
“The event is taking place against the backdrop of a round of diplomatic meetings that the minister is holding in the US, after speaking at President Trump’s mansion in the past 24 hours, and the day before at a meeting with Jewish communities in the US,” the statement said.
On Thursday, the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said in a statement it is “cautiously encouraged by Yale’s actions and will be keeping an eye on the situation and aftermath.” The university took several actions to handle the situation, including enforcing “time, place, and manner policies,” starting discipline investigations for students who did unlawful conduct and de-registering a participating student group, the federal task force said.
Israeli official was convicted for supporting terrorism
Ben Gvir – a far-right firebrand – has been public about his adoration for US President Donald Trump, proudly extolling his plan to resettle Gazans outside of the Palestinian territory.
He quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government in January because he was opposed to the ceasefire deal that saw the return of Israeli hostages from Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. He only rejoined the government last month when Israel resumed its war in Gaza.
Ben Gvir has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, and he was considered so extreme that the Israeli military rejected him from service. This is his first visit to the United States as national security minister.
Last October, a group of 90 congressional Democrats urged President Joe Biden to sanction Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, both of whom lead extreme nationalist parties within Netanyahu’s government. Ultimately, the Biden administration chose not to impose sanctions on Israeli government ministers.
Dozens arrested at Yale last year
The new protest on the New Haven campus comes exactly a year after 45 protesters were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing when they refused orders to leave Beinecke Plaza, part of a wave of demonstrations across US campuses last spring.
As part of their support for Palestinians in Gaza, protesters at the Yale campus demanded the university get rid of investments in businesses with connections to Israel’s military effort there.
In recent weeks, another Ivy League university, Harvard, has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s effort to stop campus protests, contending they are examples of antisemitism.
The Trump administration is demanding Harvard give it access to all university reports on antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias on campus generated since October 2023, as it ramps up a confrontation with the school that risks billions in federal money amid a broader push to bring elite US colleges in line with its political demands.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/middleeast/israel-acknowledges-killing-un-aid-worker-latam-intl/index.html,Israel acknowledges killing aid worker in strike after initially accusing UN of ‘baseless slander’,2025-04-24 18:22:19,"The Israeli military acknowledged on Thursday that it was responsible for killing a United Nations aid worker in a strike on a UN guesthouse in Gaza last month, backtracking on its previous denials in the face of mounting public evidence of Israeli responsibility.
The Israeli military said its preliminary investigation into the incident “indicates that the fatality was caused by tank fire from IDF troops operating in the area.”
The strike killed Marin Marinov, a 51-year-old from Bulgaria who worked to deliver life-saving aid to the population of Gaza, the UN said. Six others were injured in the deadly attack that occurred one day after Israel renewed its bombardment of Gaza, ending a two-month ceasefire.
“The building was struck due to assessed enemy presence and was not identified by the forces as a UN facility,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. “The IDF regrets this serious incident and continues to conduct thorough review processes to draw operational lessons and evaluate additional measures to prevent such events in the future. We express our deep sorrow for the loss and send our condolences to the family.”
The Israeli military initially denied any role in the strike on the UN guesthouse and Israel’s Foreign Ministry accused the United Nations of “baseless slander” for saying Israeli tank fire was the source of the attack.
The United Nations welcomed the conclusion of Israel’s investigation while emphasizing the need for “accountability.”
“There’s been more cooperation and transparency on their side that we’ve had in these types of incidents since the beginning of this conflict,” the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General Stéphane Dujarric said during a daily briefing on Thursday.
“What is clear to us is that we need to have accountability. We need to have accountability not just for this incident but we need to have accountability and transparency for all of the other times,” Dujarric added.
This is the second time in the past month that the Israeli military has made false statements about an attack on aid workers, only to backtrack in the face of irrefutable evidence contradicting the Israeli military’s official account. Last week, the Israeli military acknowledged “mistakes” that led its forces to attack multiple ambulances, a fire truck and a UN vehicle, killing 15 rescue and aid workers – but only after video of the incident emerged, disproving the IDF’s initial account.
Evidence of Israeli responsibility for the strike on the UN guesthouse on March 19 emerged almost immediately.
The day of the strike, weapons experts told CNN that damage to the building and weapons fragments filmed at the scene were consistent with Israeli tank fire.
Trevor Bell, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member who reviewed the footage, said the fragments were consistent with the M339, an Israeli tank shell. N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director at Armament Research Services (ARES) who also analyzed the footage, said at the time the “remnants appear to be from an Israeli 120 mm tank projectile, most likely the M339 multi-purpose model.”
A subsequent report by the Washington Post earlier this month found that two Israeli tank shells very likely killed the UN worker and wounded five others in that strike. The Post report also identified an Israeli tank position just over two miles from the guesthouse in satellite imagery captured the day before the strike.
The United Nations said it had repeatedly informed the Israeli military about the guest house’s location, including as recently as the night before the strike.
The Israeli military said its initial findings had been presented to the Israeli military’s chief of staff and to UN representatives and that a full investigation would be completed “in the coming days, pending the receipt of additional required information.”
‘More intense and significant pressure’
On Thursday, the IDF carried out a strike on a police headquarters in Jabalya, completely destroying the building and killing 10 Palestinians, according to Fares Afana, the director of emergency services in northern Gaza.
The Israeli military said the strike targeted a command and control center for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad that “was used to plan and execute terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.”
A separate attack in Gaza City severely damaged two apartment buildings, killing seven Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense organization. Video from the scene shows a child on the roof of a building crying for help, blood streaked across his forehead as he waves a hand covered in dust in the air.
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
On Thursday evening, the Israeli military announced that a tank driver was killed in combat in northern Gaza on Thursday, marking the second time an Israeli soldier has been killed in Gaza since the resumption of the war last month. Two more soldiers were severely injured in the incident.
“If we do not see progress in the return of the hostages, we will expand our activity into a more intense and significant operation,” said IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir during a visit to Gaza Thursday.
The Israeli military also issued evacuation orders for two areas in northern Gaza as Israel broadens its bombardment of the besieged territory in what it says is an effort to put increasing pressure on Hamas. The IDF says the evacuation orders were issued after troops faced “terrorist activities and sniper fire.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/middleeast/shark-attack-israel-intl-latam/index.html,Sharks drew crowds to this Israeli beach for years. Now a swimmer’s disappeared and a body’s been found,2025-04-22 23:17:53,"Israeli police on Tuesday scoured the Mediterranean coast for a swimmer they fear may have been attacked by a shark in an area that has long seen close encounters between marine predators and beachgoers who sometimes seek them out.
A shiver of endangered dusky and sandbar sharks has been swimming close to the area for years, attracting onlookers who approach the sharks, drawing pleas from conservation groups for authorities to separate people from the wild animal.
Nature groups say those warnings went unheeded. Police and rescue workers launched a search along the coast after reports that a shark attacked a swimmer on a beach near the city of Hadera. Israel’s Fire and Rescue Authority announced Tuesday afternoon they had found remains of a body, which was brought to the forensic institute for identification.
On Tuesday, the beach was closed as search teams used boats and underwater equipment to look for the man. His identity was not immediately known, but Israeli media said he had gone to swim with the sharks.
Israelis flocked in large numbers to the beach during a weeklong holiday, sharing the waters with a dozen or more sharks. Some tugged on the sharks’ fins, while others threw them fish to eat. Dusky sharks can grow to 4 meters (13 feet) long and weigh about 350 kilograms (750 pounds). Sandbar sharks are smaller, growing to about 2.5 meters (8 feet) and 100 kilograms (220 pounds).
Yigael Ben-Ari, head of marine rangers at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, said it was not known how the man behaved around the sharks. But he said the public should know not to enter the water when sharks are present and not to touch or play with them.
One video shared by Israeli media showed a shark swimming right up to bathers in thigh-deep water.
“What a huge shark!” the man filming exclaims, as the shark approaches him. “Whoa! He’s coming toward us!”
“Don’t move!” he implores a boy standing nearby, who replies: “I’m leaving.”
The man then asks: “What, are you afraid of the sharks?”
The behavior, some of which was witnessed by an Associated Press photographer two days before the attack, flew in the face of the advice of the parks authority.
“Like every wild animal, the sharks’ behavior may be unpredictable,” the authority said in a statement.
This would be just the third recorded shark attack in Israel, according to Ben-Ari. One person was killed in an attack in the 1940s.
The area, where warm water released by a nearby power plant flows into the sea, has for years attracted dozens of sharks between October and May. Ben-Ari said swimming is prohibited in the area, but swimmers enter the water anyway.
“It would have been appropriate to take steps to preserve and regulate public safety, but over the years, chaos has developed in the area,” the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, an environmental group, said in a statement.
It said fishermen, boats, divers, surfers and snorkelers intersected dangerously with a wild animal that “is not accustomed to being around crowds of people.”
SPNI said further steps were needed to prevent similar incidents, like designating a safe zone from where people could view the sharks without swimming close to them.

The group – most of whom worked for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) - were shot dead before being buried in a mass grave, sparking international condemnation.
The Israeli probe identified several failures during the incident, as well as breaches of orders and a failure to fully report the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. The military still stood by the decision-making of the soldiers who carried out the attack on the convoy, with the IDF’s top spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin saying the incident was based on “a chain of mistakes…but no ethical gaps.”
The IDF said the troops did not engage in “indiscriminate fire” during the incident, but they opened fire on what they believed to be a “tangible threat” amid what the military called an “operational misunderstanding.”
As a result of the investigation, the commanding officer of the 14th Brigade received a letter of reprimand, while the deputy commander of the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion involved in the incident was dismissed from his position. The IDF relieved the deputy commander, a major who both ordered his troops to open fire and fired on the convoy himself, because of his responsibility for the incident and for providing an “incomplete and inaccurate report” about what happened.
“The IDF regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians,” a statement read.
“Existing protocols have been clarified and reinforced - emphasizing the need for heightened caution when operating near rescue forces and medical personnel, even in high-intensity combat zones.”
But the general who oversaw the Israeli military’s investigation into the killings said he would not recommend any changes to the IDF’s combat policies or rules of engagement.
Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even said he believes the commander who ordered troops to open fire “acted reasonably” and in accordance with IDF rules of engagement. “There was no evidence of any unethical or immoral conduct by the forces,” Har-Even told CNN.
“It’s a mistake. It can happen tomorrow – I hope it will not happen – unfortunately it happened,” Har-Even said. “The orders are excellent. We don’t shoot on an ambulance unless they are clearly identified terrorists, or we understand that someone feels a threat from people that are coming from the ambulance.”
Har-Even’s comments came during a 90-minute briefing with international media, in which he described several of the commander’s actions as “mistakes,” but stopped short of acknowledging wrongdoing on the part of the commander or his forces. His findings have been sent to the Israeli military’s advocate general, who will determine whether to file any charges against the soldiers involved.
‘Operational errors’
The troops opened fire on three separate occasions on Sunday, March 23. In the first shooting, Israeli soldiers shot at a vehicle the IDF says was identified as belonging to Hamas. Two Palestinians were killed and one temporarily detained.
An hour later, the troops opened fire once again, this time targeting the convoy of PRCS ambulances and Civil Defense vehicles, killing another 12 Palestinians, according to the investigation.
Autopsy reports for the eight PRCS medics obtained by CNN show that most were killed by gunshot wounds to the head or chest, while others suffered from shrapnel to the torso from the force of an explosive injury. The bodies had started decomposing after they were buried in a mass grave for more than a week.
Initially, the IDF claimed the vehicles were driving suspiciously without headlights or emergency signals.
But video from the cell phone of one of the emergency responders clearly showed that the convoy was driving in a single-file line and the ambulances had their lights on. Despite the release of the video, the IDF investigation still said it was difficult to identify the ambulances.
“Due to poor night visibility, the deputy commander did not initially recognize the vehicles as ambulances,” the IDF said. “Only later, after approaching the vehicles and scanning them, was it discovered that these were indeed rescue teams.”
The IDF said that six of those killed were identified “in a retrospective examination as Hamas terrorists,” raising the question of whether the troops opened fire on ambulances before knowing if there were any militants amongst the vehicles. The military did not identify which of those killed it believed were terrorists or provide any evidence.
About 15 minutes later, the troops opened fire on a Palestinian United Nations vehicle, killing a fifteenth individual, an employee of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. The investigation concluded this was a result of “operational errors” and was “in breach of regulations.”
In video filmed by one of the military’s aerial surveillance assets, Israeli troops can be seen opening fire on the clearly-marked United Nations vehicle, minutes after they ended their attack on the convoy of emergency response vehicles.
In the video, which the military showed to reporters but declined to release, a UN vehicle can be seen arriving at the scene of the military’s deadly attack on the ambulances and a fire truck. As the UN vehicle attempted to drive slowly past the scene, individuals identified by the military as Israeli soldiers opened fire on the UN vehicle from behind as it was driving away.
“The examination determined that the fire in the first two incidents resulted from an operational misunderstanding by the troops, who believed they faced a tangible threat from enemy forces,” the IDF said. In its initial account of the events, the Israeli military said the two Palestinians killed in the first incident were members of Hamas. It’s unclear if Israel is now walking back that claim.
“The third incident involved a breach of orders during a combat setting,” the IDF said.
The bodies were then removed and buried in a mass grave along with the ambulances and other vehicles. The IDF defended the field commanders’ decision to remove the bodies but acknowledged “the decision to crush the vehicles was wrong.”
Har-Even said the attack on the convoy stemmed from a series of faulty assumptions that soldiers from the elite Golani Reconnaissance Battalion made that day and from the deputy battalion commander’s poor line of sight to the convoy, which he said was obstructed by a hillside.
Har-Even did not explain why troops continued to fire at the convoy of ambulances even as they got closer to the convoy and faced no return fire. He also said he did not believe the deputy commander had lied about the incident, even as he acknowledged he gave false statements about the flashing lights on the emergency vehicles and the subsequent attack on a UN vehicle minutes later.
“There was no attempt to conceal the event, which was discussed with international organizations and the UN, including coordination for the removal of bodies,” the IDF said.
Palestine Red Crescent decries ‘contradictions’ in Israeli probe
The president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society said “there are a lot of contradictions” in Israel’s accounts of the killing of the emergency workers.
“It is clear that in the same report and in their press conference – the occupying forces – there are a lot of contradictions,” Younis Al-Khatib said in an interview on Al-Araby TV on Sunday after Israel released its investigation.
Al-Khatib pointed to the cell phone video showing the convoy driving in a single-file line with the ambulances’ headlights on.
“Either you did not see the lights of the car and you didn’t realize these are ambulances. As you saw the video that came out, they lied and it was proven … How can you claim you didn’t see anything, you didn’t see the lights? All the evidence came out and proves that this story is untrue,” Al-Khatib said.
In the wake of the attack, the organization said the incident “can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/19/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-war-gaza-intl-latam/index.html,Netanyahu vows to continue war in Gaza despite growing opposition at home,2025-04-19 20:48:18,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the war in Gaza in the face of growing opposition to Israel’s ongoing military campaign.
In a pre-recorded video Saturday night, Netanyahu said Israel has “no choice” but to keep fighting “for our very own existence until victory.” The long-time Israeli leader called for “perseverance and resilience” in order to destroy Hamas and bring back the remaining 59 hostages.
Netanyahu pointed to Hamas’ recent rejection of an Israeli ceasefire proposal as a reason Israel will continue its bombardment of Gaza. Israel’s proposal called for a disarmament of Gaza and did not include a permanent end to the war, both of which have been red lines for Hamas.
“If we surrender to Hamas’s demands now, all the tremendous achievements gained by our soldiers, our fallen, and our wounded heroes—those achievements will simply be lost,” Netanyahu said.
He argued that allowing Hamas to remain in Gaza means “President [Donald] Trump’s important vision could never be realized.” Trump has called for moving Palestinians out of Gaza to other countries and redeveloping the coastal enclave into a “Riviera of the Middle East.” He has also floated the idea of US ownership of the narrow strip of land, which is home to more than 2 million Palestinians.
The Hostage Families Forum Headquarters criticized the Israeli premier’s taped statement.
“Many words and slogans will not succeed in hiding the simple truth — Netanyahu has no plan,” the forum said. “It’s no surprise there was no time for questions — otherwise, he would have had to answer the most basic one: What exactly is the State of Israel doing to immediately bring back all 59 hostages?”
Netanyahu also mentioned Iran during his statement, just hours after the US and Iran concluded their second round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program. “I’m committed to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,” he said. “I will not give up on this, I will not let go.”
Calls grow to end the war
Netanyahu’s speech comes amid growing protest and opposition to the ongoing military campaign.
Thousands of Israeli military reservists and retirees have signed public letters calling for a ceasefire deal to return all of the hostages, even at the cost of ending the war. The letters have now come from an increasing number of military units, including elite intelligence and commando units, as well as civilian professions.
Many Israelis prioritize a deal to return the hostages, even if it means ending the war, according to recent polling. A poll from Israel’s Channel 12 News, released late-last month, indicated that nearly 70% supported such a deal, while only 21% opposed an end to the war.
A two-month ceasefire that saw 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages released from captivity collapsed on March 18 when Israel renewed its bombardment of Gaza. Israel and the US blamed Hamas for the ceasefire’s end.
Shortly before Netanyahu’s statement, his spokesman, Omer Dostri, said “it’s not possible to bring everyone back,” calling it “a spin.” Speaking to Channel 12 News, Dostri added, “Right now, it’s not possible to make a single ‘all for all’ deal, because Hamas is demanding an end to the war and a withdrawal from Gaza.”
The leader of Israel’s opposition, Yair Lapid, said Dostri’s comments were “an admission that the Israeli government has given up on the effort to bring the hostages home.” Lapid called for Netanyahu to clarify the government’s position. In a statement on social media, he said, “If this is the Prime Minister’s official stance, he should stand up and say it himself. If not, he should apologize on behalf of his spokesperson.”
Netanyahu pre-recorded statement released a short time later did not address his spokesman’s comments.","['Dana Karni', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/18/world/press-photo-winner-israel-gaza-hnk-intl/index.html,World Press Photo 2025 contest winners announced,2025-04-18 08:37:13,"A striking portrait of a young Palestinian boy who lost both arms in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City has been named Press Photo of the Year.
Photographer Samar Abu Elouf, who is also from Gaza, met nine-year-old Mahmoud Ajjour three months after an explosion severed one of his arms and mutilated the other. Ajjour and his family were evacuated to Doha, Qatar, where Abu Elouf is based, to receive medical treatment.
“One of the most difficult things Mahmoud’s mother explained to me was how, when Mahmoud first came to the realization that his arms were amputated, the first sentence he said to her was, ‘How will I be able to hug you?’” Abu Elouf wrote in her accompanying notes on the image, which was taken for and published in The New York Times.
The photo is a stark reminder of the long-term costs of the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands and led to widespread destruction and displacement of its residents. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates about half of those killed are women and children. Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza was triggered by the deadly October 7 rampage by Hamas militants.
“This is a quiet photo that speaks loudly. It tells the story of one boy, but also of a wider war that will have an impact for generations,” said Joumana El Zein Khoury, executive director of World Press Photo, in a press statement.
The jury observed three central themes — conflict, migration, and climate change — in the entries this year, says Lucy Conticello, director of photography for Le Monde’s M magazine and one of the judges.
“Another way of seeing them is as stories of resilience, family, and community,” Conticello said in a press statement.
The contrast in the winning photo — light and dark, beauty and pain — captured the attention of the judges, she added.
The winning photo was selected from nearly 60,000 entries submitted by 3,778 photographers across more than 140 countries.
Two other works were selected as runners-up: an otherworldly image of Chinese migrants warming themselves by a fire after crossing the US-Mexico border, and a haunting image of a young man walking to his village, once accessible by boat, along a desert-like riverbed in the Amazon.
Winners were also selected for regional categories, including an ethereal image of a stranded Boeing jet surrounded by floodwaters at Salgado Filho International Airport in Brazil, and a groom at his wedding in Sudan.
The winning images are currently on display in a traveling exhibition, which opens today (April 18) in Amsterdam at De Nieuwe Kerk, followed by shows around the globe, including in London, Jakarta, Sydney and Mexico City.",['Rebecca Cairns'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/middleeast/hamas-rejects-israeli-ceasefire-offer-intl-latam/index.html,Hamas rejects ceasefire offer as far-right Israeli lawmakers call for escalation in Gaza,2025-04-17 22:10:57,"Hamas has rejected the Israeli ceasefire offer presented earlier this week, according to a senior Hamas official, instead calling for a “comprehensive” proposal to end the war.
The official told CNN, “The offer is rejected in full and in detail.”
The rejection prompted far-right Israeli lawmakers to issue calls for an immediate escalation in Gaza, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to unleash “hell” and pursue “complete victory.”
The Israeli ceasefire proposal did not guarantee an end to the war and called for a disarmament of Gaza, both of which have been red lines for Hamas. The militant organization refuses to give up its weapons and demands that any proposal includes a permanent end to the war.
“We want a comprehensive package,” the official said.
The Israeli plan called for a 45-day truce, during which the two sides would aim to negotiate a permanent ceasefire.
Under the proposal, the remaining 59 hostages would be released in stages, starting with American-Israeli Edan Alexander on the first day of the truce as a “special gesture” to the United States. A further nine Israeli hostages would be released in two stages in exchange for 120 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and more than 1,100 detainees held without charge since October 7, 2023.
Israel’s proposal also demands that Hamas provide information about the remaining living Israeli hostages held by the group, “in exchange for information about the Palestinian detainees,” and the release of the bodies of 16 deceased Israeli hostages for the remains of 160 deceased Palestinians held by Israel.
Hamas studied the proposal for several days before responding. But from the beginning, the proposal stood little chance of success. Hamas had repeatedly made clear that it demanded an end to the war as part of any hostage release, and it refused calls for a complete disarmament. Hamas also called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, whereas the Israeli proposal only included a temporary redeployment of the military.
In a televised statement from Qatar on Thursday night, Khalil Al-Hayya, the head of the negotiating delegation, said, “The resistance and its weaponry are linked to the existence of the (Israeli) occupation, and it is a natural right for our people and all peoples under occupation.”
Al-Hayya insisted that Hamas is “immediately” ready to begin negotiations for a comprehensive agreement that would see the release of the remaining hostages for an “agreed-upon number” of Palestinian prisoners. Such an agreement would include the beginning of Gaza’s reconstruction and an end to the blockade of Gaza.
Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that Israel would continue its bombardment of Gaza. “The state of Israel shall not surrender to Hamas and won’t end the war without the complete victory and fulfillment of all its objectives, including eliminating Hamas and returning all the hostages,” he said in a statement.
National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir echoed Smotrich, writing on Telegram: “No deal, no ceasefire, and no aid – only the continuation of fighting until the surrender of the Nazis from Gaza. Activate all force and might until Hamas begs on its knees.”
The Hope Forum, a right-wing group representing hostages’ families, tweeted: “Only massive military pressure, a total blockade, and capturing territory will force Hamas to beg for a deal. What are you waiting for?!”
Israel shut off humanitarian aid and supplies going into the coastal enclave in early-March, igniting a humanitarian crisis that UN officials says is the worst since the war began. Israel’s renewed assault on Gaza has displaced more than 500,000 Palestinians in less than a month, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza says that the attacks on Gaza have killed nearly 1,700 Palestinians since March 18.
Israel has argued that the humanitarian blockade has pressured Hamas into agreeing to a ceasefire. On Wednesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, “The pressure on Hamas to carry out the deal is heavy and the tension between it and the local population is increasing.”
But that pressure has failed to force Hamas into accepting the latest proposal.
UN warns of humanitarian catastrophe
The United Nations issued a dire warning over the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, saying lifesaving supplies were nearing “total depletion” due to Israel’s block on aid.
More than 2 million people remain trapped in the besieged enclave, with mental health needs skyrocketing, critical infrastructure in ruins, and essential services on the brink of collapse, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, told a press briefing.
Dujarric said that nearly 90% of water infrastructure – including wells, pumping stations, and sewage plants – had been destroyed or damaged by hostilities, exacerbating disease risks and forcing families to rely on unsafe sources.
“Stress levels, particularly among children, are surging as violence and deprivation persist,” Dujarric said, emphasizing that Israel, as the occupying power, bears legal obligations under international law to ensure access to food, medical care, and public health services. The UN reiterated demands for urgent humanitarian access, warning that delays risk mass preventable deaths.
Israel launched its war on Hamas in Gaza in October 2023, following the militant group’s surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
More than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the health ministry in the enclave.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/middleeast/jewish-worshippers-aqsa-visit-intl-latam/index.html,Thousands of Jewish worshippers visit Jerusalem holy site as Israeli lawmaker boasts ‘Arabs aren’t allowed to come near us’,2025-04-17 20:34:03,"Thousands of Jewish worshippers visited a Jerusalem holy site during the holiday of Passover as far-right Israeli lawmaker Zvi Sukkot boasted, “Arabs aren’t allowed to come near us.”
Sukkot, a member of the Religious Zionism party, visited the al-Aqsa compound in the Old City of Jerusalem on Thursday morning, prostrating himself on the ground and praying in violation of the delicate status quo agreement that governs the site.
“Jews are bowing, praying, holding minyanim here,” said Sukkot, referencing a quorum of ten men required for certain Jewish worship. “Arabs aren’t allowed to come near us at all,” the lawmaker added, with Israeli security forces walking amongst the worshippers around him.
While anyone can visit the al-Aqsa compound, only Muslims are allowed to pray there, according to the status quo agreement, which has existed since Israel captured the Old City of Jerusalem in 1967. The site, which is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, is the holiest place in Judaism. It is known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, and it is the third holiest site in Islam.
But the status quo agreement has increasingly been tested and, in some cases, deliberately challenged. Far-right lawmakers in Israel have made repeated visits to the holy site, encouraging other Jewish worshippers to do the same. Some of these visits have sparked protests, as well as diplomatic fallout across the region.
Video from the scene on Thursday showed Sukkot surrounded by a group of Jewish men openly praying while an Israeli police officer walked around in the background, not disturbing or interrupting the prayer session. Sukkot said it was far different to his last visit to the site 14 years ago.
“Back then, they used to watch you closely – if they saw you whisper a prayer, they’d jump on you. What’s happening now is an incredible miracle,” he said.
Sukkot’s visit comes amid a surge of Jewish worshippers going to the holy site to pray, according to the Temple Mount Administration, which said 6,315 worshippers had so far attended prayer sessions since Passover began last weekend.
The organization, which filmed the video of Sukkot at the compound, added that a daily record was set on Thursday, with 2,106 attending. Despite the moniker, the Temple Mount Administration is not a government agency.
Instead, it is a right-wing organization working to organize and promote Jewish prayer at the holy site. They described the number of visitors as “historic records,” saying it was a 37% increase from last year.
Far-right Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party, praised Sukkot’s visit. “What wasn’t done in 30 years is being done on my watch, and I’m grateful to have been granted, by God’s grace, the privilege of leading this tremendous change,” he said on social media.
Ben Gvir has frequently visited the holy site, making clear his intentions to allow and promote Jewish worship, despite the prohibition. Following a visit in December, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office was forced to put out a statement saying, “The status quo at Temple Mount has not changed.”","['Dana Karni', 'Tamar Michaelis', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu ratified an amendment to the country’s immigration law after it was passed by parliament on Tuesday, a statement from his office said.
The amendment introduces a new provision to the Immigration Act, expressly prohibiting the entry of visitors with Israeli passports into the Maldives, it added.
“The ratification reflects the government’s firm stance in response to the continuing atrocities and ongoing acts of genocide committed by Israel against the Palestinian people,” the statement said.
The Israeli foreign ministry and the country’s consular office in Colombo did not respond to requests for comment.
Israel has consistently rejected any accusation of genocide, saying it has respected international law and has a right to defend itself after the cross-border Hamas attack from Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023 that prompted the war.
South Africa has brought a case against it at the UN’s International Court of Justice and Amnesty International accused it of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in a report last December, charges it has denied.
Maldives’ Muizzu initially made the call to ban Israeli passport holders in June 2024 after a cabinet recommendation, which prompted the Israeli foreign ministry to recommend that its citizens avoid the archipelago famous for its pristine beaches and plush resorts.
Tourism is a major driver of the Maldives economy, accounting for about 21% of its GDP and earning $5.6 billion in 2024, according to government data. The island nation is expecting earnings of about $5 billion this year.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/middleeast/lebanons-president-says-he-seeks-to-disarm-hezbollah-this-year-intl/index.html,Lebanon’s president says he seeks to disarm Hezbollah this year,2025-04-16 14:10:18,"Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said he hopes Iran-backed Hezbollah can be disarmed this year, following an Israeli military campaign that left the group decapitated and significantly weakened.
“We hope that Hezbollah’s weapons will be withdrawn or that their possession will be restricted to the state in 2025, and this is what I am striving for,” the United States-backed president said during an interview with Al-Araby Al-Jadeed published on Tuesday.
Hezbollah was formed in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the early 1980s, and has grown to become a formidable rival political and military force within the country. The militants have long resisted calls to disarm.
“As for Hezbollah members, they are ultimately Lebanese, and if they want to join the army, they can undergo so-called absorption courses,” Aoun said, adding that the group would not be allowed to function as a distinct unit within the Lebanese army.
He stressed however that the process could only be done through dialogue.
“We want to withdraw Hezbollah’s weapons, but we do not want to ignite a civil war,” he said.
Experts say that while Hezbollah may prefer to retain its arms, Israel’s weakening of the group and its continued attacks on Lebanon along with pressure from the Lebanese government may make the once inconceivable prospect a reality.
Until its conflict with Israel last year, Hezbollah was widely regarded as the most formidable non-state armed group in the Middle East, with tens of thousands of missiles and a well-trained military force.
Aoun said the government has yet to speak to Hezbollah about the matter, but that Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a Shiite politician allied to the militant group, “is in full agreement” that the state should have a monopoly over arms. Berri served as the mediator between Hezbollah and the US in talks last year to reach a ceasefire with Israel.
An adviser to Berri did not reply to a CNN request for comment.
Aoun’s ‘delicate position’
Some experts say that while Aoun is facing pressure from both Israel and the United States to quickly disarm Hezbollah, he is nonetheless wary of the precarious situation he is in.
“Aoun said that he will strive to introduce a state monopoly over arms this year, but he did not actually commit to that timeframe,” David Woods, Senior Lebanon Analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. “(Aoun) fully understands the state’s delicate position vis-a-vis Hezbollah, which probably retains menacing military capacity despite its heavy losses during the war.”
Last week, Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said in a news conference that the group is ready for dialogue with the Lebanese government on the country’s defense strategy. Woods said that offer means that Aoun’s proposal “may not seem that confrontational.”
Asked about the failure of previous attempts to discuss Hezbollah’s weapons, Aoun said the regional situation had changed, pointing to Iran’s “developing position” toward allied militias in the region.
Hezbollah has relied on its armed struggle against Israel to burnish its popular support, Woods said. “After last year’s disastrous war with Israel, it remains unclear if the party can find a replacement source of political legitimacy.”
Aoun said he has told US officials Israel’s presence in southern Lebanon “gives Hezbollah a pretext” to remain armed, urging the US to pressure Israel to withdraw.
Lebanon’s government has repeatedly condemned continued Israeli strikes on its territory, calling them a violation of its sovereignty and a breach of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement.
Asked whether it is possible for Lebanon to engage in normalization talks with Israel should the Israeli army withdraw, Aoun said that while “anything is possible” in politics, the circumstances on the ground dictate reality.
“The Americans currently know that normalization or peace negotiations with Israel are impossible, and the key for us today is to establish long-term stability on the border,” he said.
Israel-Hezbollah war ‘not likely’
Full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah remains a possibility but is unlikely, he said, adding that Hezbollah has recently “shown a sense of responsibility despite the heavy human losses it has suffered.”
“Ultimately the possibility remains with the continuation of (Israeli) attacks,” Aoun said. “Hence, we always repeat: Let us negotiate with Hezbollah.”
Hezbollah’s disarmament could have a significant impact on regional dynamics. Just months ago, the group was seen as Iran’s most powerful regional proxy, engaging in tit-for-tat strikes with the Israeli army until an Israeli campaign killed many of its senior guard. The toppling of Hezbollah-ally Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria also weakened the group.
As Lebanon reels from an ongoing cross-border conflict with Israel and years of economic meltdown, Hezbollah may also face pressure from its own constituency to lay down its arms, Woods said. Disarming could remove obstacles for the delivery of post-war reconstruction aid, “which many Hezbollah supporters desperately need.”
The group’s backer, Iran, may also use this as a negotiating tool in its nuclear talks with the Trump administration, trading “its support for the group in negotiations,” Woods added.",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

The bomb fell near the Nir Yithzak kibbutz adjacent to southern Gaza, which sits approximately two miles from the border.
“A short while ago, a munition fell from an IDF fighter jet that was on its way to a mission in the Gaza Strip. The munition landed in an open area near Nir Yitzhak due to a technical malfunction,” the Israeli military said in a short statement.
The IDF did not say what type of bomb it was.
There are no injuries as a result of the bomb falling, the military said, and the incident is now under review.
A spokesman for Nir Yitzhak said the bomb landed in the village’s farm area.
The kibbutz is in contact with military officials and expects a thorough investigation, the spokesman said.
According to Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics, Nir Yitzhak has a population of approximately 550 people.
It was one of the villages that came under attack in the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.
According to an interview in Israel’s YNet news in February, about half of the kibbutz has returned to live in the community.
The incident is extraordinarily rare, but not entirely unprecedented.
Last May, an Israeli fighter jet accidentally dropped a bomb on the community of Yated, which neighbors Nir Yitzhak.
The munition did not explode and was collected by Israeli forces.
One month later, an Israeli tank shell fired in southern Gaza deviated from its target and impacted near the border fence, according to the IDF.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/middleeast/israel-proposes-gaza-ceasefire-deal-to-release-hostages-intl/index.html,"Israel proposes Gaza ceasefire deal to release 10 hostages for hundreds of Palestinians, Hamas official says",2025-04-15 10:18:34,"Hamas is “studying” an Israeli proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza that would see 10 hostages released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, an official with the militant group told CNN.
The proposal, received by Hamas on Monday, outlines an initial framework for a 45-day truce in the Palestinian enclave during which the two sides would aim to negotiate a permanent ceasefire, according to the official.
The Israeli proposal also calls for the disarmament of Gaza, previously a red line for Hamas. It does not include a guarantee of a permanent end to the war, which Hamas has demanded as part of a comprehensive agreement.
The Hamas official said the group will not agree to any Israeli ceasefire proposal that calls for its disarmament or sees Israeli forces return to Gaza after an initial withdrawal, making it unlikely that the group will accept it.
The offer marks Israel’s first proposal to bring back hostages from Gaza since it resumed the war in March. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hostage families and a growing number of military reservists to reach a deal.
CNN has reached out to Israeli officials for comment.
Under the proposal, Israeli American Edan Alexander would be released on the first day of the truce as a “special gesture” to the United States, the Hamas official said.
Hamas released a propaganda video over the weekend in which Alexander appealed directly to Trump, asking why he hasn’t been released yet. The three-minute video, almost certainly filmed under duress, is the second proof-of-life video of Alexander since the war began 18 months ago.
However, Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed on Tuesday that they have lost contact with the militants holding Alexander, after they said the Israeli military bombed the location where Alexander was being held.
CNN cannot independently verify the claim.
The militant organization did not say when or where the strike happened. The Israeli military and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Al-Qassam Brigades previously lied about the fate of at least one hostage. In November, the group claimed that an Israeli woman it was holding hostage had been killed in an Israeli bombing and released a photo of her body wrapped in a red-stained white sheet. A tattoo identified the women as Daniella Gilboa, an Israeli soldier. Gilboa was released by Hamas alive in January.
The Hamas official speaking about the Israeli proposal said that a further nine Israeli hostages would be released in two stages in exchange for 120 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and more than 1,100 detainees held without charge since October 7, 2023, the official added.
Israel’s proposal also demands that Hamas provide information about the remaining living Israeli hostages held by the group, “in exchange for information about the Palestinian detainees,” and the release of the bodies of 16 deceased Israeli hostages in exchange for the remains of 160 deceased Palestinians held by Israel.
The “temporary ceasefire lasting 45 days” would also include the cessation of military operations and the entry of aid into Gaza as well as “an agreed mechanism to ensure that aid reaches only civilians,” the Hamas official said.
The proposal would also include the entry of equipment necessary for sheltering Palestinians displaced in Gaza.
A Hamas delegation met with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo over the weekend. Israel has not publicly acknowledged whether it sent a team to the negotiations.
Since early March, Israel has cut Gaza off from the supply of humanitarian aid including food, with aid agencies warning that the situation for the strip’s 2 million civilians has deteriorated dangerously, only worsened by intensive Israeli military operations.
Israel’s move to block aid came ahead of its renewed military offensive in the enclave, in what it said was a bid to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and impose new conditions on a ceasefire that was in effect at the time. More than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since mid-March, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave.
Under the new ceasefire proposal, the Israeli military would withdraw for seven days from parts of Gaza including the southern city of Rafah, some areas of the north and the east of Gaza City, according to the Hamas official.
Israel’s proposal also “stipulates the disarmament of the Gaza Strip” and negotiations on a “declaration of a permanent ceasefire,” to begin on the third day of the truce, the official told CNN.
“Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire should be completed within 45 days,” after which the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, both living and deceased, would be released to Israel, the official said.
“If an agreement is reached on the temporary ceasefire, it can be extended under conditions and for a duration agreed upon by the two parties… if the period ends without an agreement, it will be extended in exchange for new prisoners.”
Some details outlined by the Hamas official appeared to match aspects of the proposal earlier confirmed to CNN by a senior Israeli official.
‘Steps are underway’ to reach a deal
The Israeli official previously told CNN that the latest proposal from Israel would demand the release of 10 hostages from Gaza, as well as the release of Alexander as a gesture to President Donald Trump. According to the Israeli official, the proposal would include phases during which Hamas would provide information about all the other remaining hostages.
On Sunday, Netanyahu’s office said that “steps are underway” to reach a new hostage-ceasefire deal in Gaza, while speaking to the family of hostage Eitan Mor.
One of the groups representing hostages’ families, the Tikva Forum, confirmed the conversation and said that Netanyahu had updated the Mor family “on the progress of the negotiations for the release of 10 abductees alive.”
Netanyahu, who visited Israeli troops in northern Gaza on Tuesday, said Israel was “determined to achieve all our war goals.”
“We insist that they release our hostages,” he said while in Gaza.
Israeli media have also reported that the negotiations are for the release of 10 hostages, but the prime minister’s office has not confirmed the number.
CNN is working to confirm other details of the proposal that were laid out by the Hamas official.
Also on Sunday, senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi said on Telegram that while Hamas had a positive attitude to any proposal “based on halting the aggression and the withdrawal of occupation forces… we will not accept a shift toward a fragmented process limited to a food-for-prisoners (hostages) deal.”","['Abeer Salman', 'Irene Nasser']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/middleeast/israeli-ministers-accuse-shin-bet-chief-of-waging-political-vendetta-intl/index.html,Israeli ministers accuse embattled security agency chief of waging political vendetta against government,2025-04-15 14:20:43,"Israeli ministers have redoubled their attacks on the embattled head of the country’s security agency, claiming he is undermining the government with a politically motivated investigation into a Shin Bet agent.
The agent, who has not been named, was arrested last Wednesday on suspicion of committing security-related offenses. Police say he used his position and access to Shin Bet systems to pass classified information to unauthorized parties “on several occasions.” The Shin Bet, officially known as the Israel Security Agency, is the country’s equivalent of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
The arrest of the agent deepens an already bitter feud between members of the government and the leader of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, who has said he will resign in the next few weeks. Ministers accuse him of mounting a number of politically motivated investigations designed to discredit the government. The acrimony soared following the QatarGate affair, which has ensnared two close associates of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Shin Bet acknowledged the leak and the subsequent investigation into the agent’s actions. It said that during the Gaza war, there has been a rise in leaks of classified information by employees of security agencies. More than 20 leaks-related investigations have been carried out, it said.
Last month, Netanyahu said he had lost confidence in Bar, but the Shin Bet chief has received support from the opposition.
The suspect’s lawyers say the information that he passed to a minister and two journalists was “of immense public importance” but posed no threat to public safety.
Amichai Chikli, the minister who received the information from the accused Shin Bet agent, said he was a hero for passing it on.
Chikli claimed the information showed that Bar “was obsessively spying on a sitting minister” and that the agent had “revealed that the parts of the Shin Bet’s investigation into the circumstances of the (Gaza) war’s outbreak that were made public present a false and distorted picture.”
“Israel has never had a Shin Bet chief as reckless, arrogant, and incompetent as (Bar),” he said.
The agent’s lawyers said the information he’d provided presented a more complex account of Shin Bet’s conduct before October 7 than was previously published. Hamas-led militants attacked Israel that day in 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and igniting the ongoing war in Gaza.
‘A real regime coup’
Commenting on the arrest, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said: “This is what a real regime coup looks like.” He described Bar as a “dangerous individual” who uses the agency’s intelligence and investigative tools “as instruments to retaliate against politicians and journalists.”
The government voted to dismiss Bar late last month. But Israel’s Supreme Court froze the decision after the Attorney General said the firing could not proceed without the approval of a special committee.
Netanyahu’s Likud party portrayed the accused agent as a whistleblower who had exposed how Bar had “transformed parts of the Shin Bet into a private militia of the deep state.” The party accused Bar of working with Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, another target of right-wing ire.
Yair Lapid, the head of Israel’s opposition, rushed to Bar’s defense, saying the attacks against him were “a dangerous bloodbath for him and the Shin Bet members whose fighters protect the state’s security.”
“The Israeli government is a government of criminals that attacks investigators who investigate offenses against state security,” Lapid said on social media.
Critics have linked the attempt to fire Bar directly to the QatarGate affair, in which court documents show the two Netanyahu associates arrested by Shin Bet are suspected of receiving money from Qatar and working to portray the country positively in the media.
“When Netanyahu gets in trouble with Qatar he tries to fire the investigator,” said Yair Golan, leader of Israel’s left-wing Democrats party. “He will do everything to save himself. Himself and his mouthpieces. Netanyahu is dangerous to Israel.”","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Oren Liebermann', 'Tim Lister']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/world/israel-strike-gaza-city-hospital-intl/index.html,Israeli strike leaves Gaza City’s last fully functioning hospital out of service as offensive escalates,2025-04-13 11:11:22,"An Israeli air strike early on Sunday has incapacitated the last fully functioning hospital in Gaza City as the military expands and intensifies its campaign across the territory.
No casualties were reported from the strike but the Anglican church in Jerusalem – which runs the Al-Ahli Baptist hospital – said a boy with a head injury died in the rushed evacuation of patients. It said that the hospital had received only 20 minutes warning ahead of the strike and was forced to take patients into the streets.
Parts of the hospital – including the emergency room and reception area – were extensively damaged. There was also damage to the adjoining St Philip’s church, according to video received by CNN.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that they had struck “a command-and-control center used by Hamas” in attack, without offering proof. They said steps had been taken ahead of the strike to mitigate harm to civilians. Hamas denied the allegation the hospital was being used for military purposes.
The Israeli military is extending its ground operations deep into Gaza, creating a large buffer zone between the Strip and Israeli territory and pushing hundreds of thousands of civilians into an ever-smaller area on the Mediterranean coast. In the south, the military announced it seized the Morag corridor, cutting off Rafah from the rest of Gaza. On Sunday night the defense ministry said the IDF had “completed the occupation of the Morag axis” making the area “part of the Israeli security zone,” adding that the northern border area in Gaza was also being expanded as part of the “security zone.”
“Tens of percentages of Gaza’s territory have become part of Israel’s security zones,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said.
“The main goal is to exert heavy pressure on Hamas in favor of returning to the outline of releasing the hostages – and the more Hamas persists in its refusal, the more IDF activity will intensify,” Katz claimed.
In all, according to the United Nations, some 400,000 people have been told to move over the past three weeks, with hospitals often used as a place of shelter throughout the conflict.
One patient in the Al-Ahli Baptist hospital, Mohammed Abu Naser, told CNN he was still inside when it was struck.
“We expected that we would all die inside the hospital… I have no treatment or anything right now. We have no option but to travel abroad for treatment,” Abu Naser added.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that the hospital was temporarily closed and directed people to three other hospitals.
The Jerusalem diocese condemned the strike and said that in addition to the damage to the emergency department the two-storey Genetic Laboratory was demolished. The diocese said it was the fifth time the hospital had been struck since October 2023.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the now “out of service” hospital’s pharmacy was also destroyed and that it was forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals – while 40 critical patients could not be moved. Hospital Director Fadel Naim said the child who died during evacuation had succumbed to “lack of oxygen and severe cold.”
As health facilities across Gaza come under pressure for lack of medicine and equipment, the WHO said that two missions – to Al-Ahli and the Indonesian hospital – had been denied by the Israeli authorities.
In a post on X, the organization said hospitals in Gaza are “in dire need, yet the shrinking humanitarian access is obstructing WHO’s ability to resupply them and preventing patients from safely receiving life-saving care.”
Samer Attar, an American doctor with the Palestinian American Bridge working in the Al-Ahli hospital, told CNN that the attack had created a “desperate situation.”
“The people here are exhausted, they’re hungry, they’re tired, they’re wounded, not just physically but also psychically,” he said.
Al-Ahli is one of the few functioning hospitals across Gaza, treating up to 1,000 patients a day. An Israeli siege left Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City – the largest in the territory – in ruins last year. It began accepting some patients months later.
The strike drew international condemnation including from the UK, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
Deadly strikes in central Gaza
The Israeli military says its forces are operating in several areas of Gaza. The IDF said Sunday that it had attacked a weapons storage compound in northern Gaza early on Sunday and announced that over the previous 48 hours, the air force had struck more than “90 terror targets belonging to terrorist organizations throughout the Gaza Strip.”
Video also showed another airstrike on a building in the area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.
The IDF said the building was another Hamas control center and at the time it was struck “numerous Hamas terrorists were operating from within the compound.” In a later statement, the military said it killed “Ubayd Allah Na’im al-Hadhud Musa, who served as the deputy head of a Hamas sniper cell in the area of Deir al-Balah.”
Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, told CNN that three bodies had been brought to the hospital after the strike. He said a strike on a vehicle in the same area on Sunday had killed seven people, six of them brothers.
Another strike later Sunday appeared to have hit the Deir al-Balah municipal building, killing a senior member of the Hamas-run justice ministry, according to local journalists.
The Israeli military meanwhile said it had intercepted another rocket fired from Gaza. In response, it issued another evacuation order for several areas of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, saying on X: “We will attack with extreme force every area from which rockets are launched.”
Israel says it is expanding its campaign in Gaza as part of efforts to force Hamas to free its remaining hostages.
One of them – American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander – appealed directly to President Donald Trump in the second proof-of-life video of the captive released by Hamas Saturday.
Alexander – who is almost certainly speaking under duress in the three-minute propaganda video – says he believed Trump would succeed in bringing him out of Gaza.
It’s unclear when the video was shot, but Alexander references being in Gaza for 551 days, which would indicate the video was recorded quite recently. The video was released on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum asked Jewish families to leave an empty place setting for the hostages to mark their time in captivity.
“Each moment grows more unbearable. You can see it in his face – his fear, his desperation,” Alexander’s parents Yael and Adi said on Sunday. “President Trump, our hope and trust rest with you now.”",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/middleeast/israel-gaza-offensive-displaced-rafah-intl/index.html,Israel’s Gaza offensive pushes hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into an ever-shrinking bubble,2025-04-06 00:00:00,"The Israeli military is extending its ground operations deep into Gaza, creating a large buffer zone between the Strip and Israeli territory and pushing hundreds of thousands of civilians into an ever-smaller area on the Mediterranean coast.
By CNN’s tally, the Israel Defense Forces has issued 20 evacuation orders since March 18, encompassing large parts of Gaza, including all of Rafah in the south.
In all, according to the United Nations, some 400,000 people have been told to move over the past three weeks, as the Israeli military intensifies efforts to force Hamas to free Israeli hostages. In the process much of Gaza has become uninhabitable or out of bounds.
The streets of Gaza City were crammed with waves of fleeing civilians Friday, carrying what they could as they left other parts of central and northern Gaza.
One displaced man, Raed Radwan, watched as hundreds more people entered the neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan, describing it as “completely filled with tents and displaced families.”
“I see tents and people lining both sides of the road in heartbreaking conditions.
Bulldozers are clearing the rubble of bombed homes to make space for more tents,” he told CNN.
Hatem Abdulsalam, also in Gaza City, told CNN that he could not “describe what we’re suffering due to garbage, flies, mosquitoes and strange insects, they are everywhere due to the waste piling up in the streets.”
“You see tents for the displaced everywhere, even among piles of garbage, because of the lack of space.”
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday that more than two-thirds of Gaza is now either under active displacement orders or designated as “no-go” zones – areas where humanitarian teams are required to coordinate their movements with Israeli authorities.
The Israeli strategy, set out by Defense Minister Israel Katz, is to empty large parts of Gaza and treat anyone staying behind as a combatant. Israeli officials have spoken of ratcheting up the pressure on Hamas to force it to make concessions on the release of the remaining hostages.
“Many areas are being captured and added to the security zones of the State of Israel, making Gaza smaller and more isolated,” Katz said on a visit to Gaza last week.
Katz spoke of “cutting Gaza into parts, even in places like the Morag route, where we have not operated until now.”
The Morag Corridor refers to the dismantled Jewish settlement of Morag in southern Gaza that once existed between Khan Younis and Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday that with the occupation of the corridor, “the encirclement of Rafah has been completed.”
A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel is planning to hold a significant portion of Gaza for an “indefinite” period of time.
Still, after 18 months of war, Israel is still facing a dogged adversary.
In August last year, Israel declared that Hamas’ Rafah Brigade had been defeated as it established control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border. But earlier this week, the new IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, told Israeli troops in Gaza, “I expect you to defeat Hamas’ Rafah Brigade and to achieve victory wherever you operate.”
And on Saturday, three rockets were fired from southern Gaza towards Israel, despite the IDF’s control over much of the area.
Israel’s strategy may have another purpose; to make life so unbearable for Gazans crammed into an ever-smaller pocket of territory without proper shelter that they begin to head for the exit.
Katz suggested as much when he said: “We are working to advance the plan for the voluntary migration of Gaza’s residents, in accordance with the vision of the US President,” referring to Donald Trump’s controversial plan to relocate Palestinians in Gaza and redevelop the territory.
At the White House last Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel was “enabling the people of Gaza to freely make a choice to go wherever they want.”
Trump had “put forward a vision, a bold vision, which we discussed as well, including the countries that might be amenable and are amenable to accepting Palestinians,” Netanyahu said.
But at least in public, Trump showed little enthusiasm for following through on that vision.
For civilians, the unrelenting misery of the last 18 months has just got a lot worse – especially as no aid has entered Gaza for six weeks. The United Nations says it has storage and distribution sites within the displacement zones.
“Overcrowded shelters are in terrible condition, service providers are struggling to operate, and resources are being depleted,” OCHA said on Friday.
“Everything is running extremely low: Bakeries have shut down, life-saving medicines have run out, and water production has been drastically reduced,” the agency said.
It added that many of its efforts to distribute what aid is left within Gaza are blocked by Israeli authorities.
Gaza’s health ministry says that 37% of essential medicines are now completely out of stock, as are more than 50% of cancer drugs.
The United Nations and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza who have spoken with CNN, say hunger is spreading.
Israel implemented the blockade in March to pressure Hamas into accepting new terms for an extension of a ceasefire agreement which had been in place since January. But there is no sign of a new ceasefire being agreed.
CNN has spoken with just a few of the tens of thousands on the move. They are exhausted and disoriented, confused as to whether to obey evacuation orders or hunker down.
Thirty-year-old Faisal Jamal Faisal from Al-Shujaiya in central Gaza arrived in Gaza City with scant possessions.
Speaking as drones buzzed overhead, Faisal said he had stayed at home despite one order to leave. Then an adjacent building had been struck and many people killed, and yet another evacuation order was issued. So he left.
Surrounded by eight members of his family, five of them children, Faisal said: “We don’t know where we are going, wherever our feet take us. We have left everything behind us.”
Gesturing towards his children, he asked: “What have they seen from life, no education, no playing, no sense of childhood?”
The UN Human Rights Office says Israeli strikes have reduced the shelter available, calculating that in the three weeks since March 18, “there were some 224 incidents of Israeli strikes on residential buildings and tents for internally displaced people.”
“In some 36 strikes about which the UN Human Rights Office corroborated information, the fatalities recorded so far were only women and children,” the office said.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for a response to the claim.
Israel has insisted that its strikes are precisely targeted, and care is taken to warn civilians of impending military operations.
That’s of little comfort to 71-year old Abu Mohammad, who suffers from glaucoma and diabetes and is now in Gaza City with nowhere to go.
Visibly distressed and struggling to move, he told CNN on Friday: “Maybe this is the twentieth time we have been displaced. Life has no meaning or future, even the past has been taken from us.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/middleeast/israel-reservists-join-protest-movement-intl/index.html,Dissent against war grows in Israel’s military as reservists from elite unit join protest movement,2025-04-11 14:16:43,"A small group of reservists from Israel’s elite military intelligence unit joined a call for an immediate return of the hostages in Gaza even if it requires an immediate end to the war, in a sign of a growing protest movement after more than 18 months of war.
The public letter, with more than 250 signatories, says the war “is currently mainly serving political and personal interests and not security interests.”
“The continuation of the war doesn’t contribute to any of the declared objectives, and will lead to the death of hostages, (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers, and of innocents,” the authors wrote.
The letter was written by reservists and retirees from Israel’s elite Unit 8200, the biggest military intelligence unit. It also criticizes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s stated plans to defeat Hamas and return the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza.
To continue governing, the prime minister requires the support of coalition partners from far-right parties who have threatened to quit the government should the war end.
“The government didn’t take responsibility for the catastrophe, and doesn’t admit that it has no plan or solution for the crisis,” the authors wrote. “We join the call of the air crews to all Israeli citizens to take action and demand, everywhere and in any way, the return of the hostages now and the cessation of the fighting.”
The new public protest comes a day after hundreds of air force retirees and reservists published a similar letter in major newspapers in Israel, saying “the war mainly serves political and personal interests and not security interests.”
Israel has a relatively small standing military, but a much larger reserve corps upon which it relies during an extended conflict. A growing protest movement within the reserves could potentially affect the Israeli military’s ability to conduct an extended campaign in Gaza.
While the two letters criticized the continuation of the war, the signatories have not refused to serve.
Within hours of the first letter’s release on Thursday, the Israeli military announced that it had fired the air force reservists who had signed the letter and was analyzing the signatures to see how many more were still in the military. An IDF official said most of the signatories are not active reservists.
The commander of the Israel Air Force, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, criticized the letter in his own missive published Friday.
“The messages which appear in the proclamation express a lack of trust and damage the cohesion within the force,” Bar wrote. “Such publication has no place during wartime as IDF soldiers and commanders are risking their lives.”
‘Funded by foreign money’
Netanyahu slammed the new protest letter and attempted to cast the authors as a tiny minority.
“They were written by a small group of bad apples, operated by organizations funded by foreign money, which have one goal – topping the right-wing government,” Netanyahu said in a statement, without providing any evidence of his claims of foreign influence.
But Netanyahu’s statement acknowledged that the protest letters were coming from multiple parts of the military, and mentioned a potential similar letter from the navy. “Once again those same letters: one time on behalf of pilots, another time on behalf of navy graduates, and other times under different names,” he said.
The prime minister tried to downplay the significance of the letters despite recent polls showing that nearly 70% of the Israeli public supports an end to the war in order to free the remaining hostages.
“This isn’t a trend. This isn’t an influx. This is a small group of retired personnel, who are loud, anarchist and disconnected,” he said.
The move to clamp down on the public protest appeared aimed at stemming increasingly vocal discontent among reservists and preventing a repeat of 2023, when waves of reservists said they would refuse to serve in protest of Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul efforts.
Nearly all of those reservists ultimately answered call-ups they received after Israel was attacked on October 7, but that wartime unity has begun to falter as the war has dragged on.","['Tamar Michaelis', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/middleeast/israels-political-leaders-steering-ceasefire-talks-frustrate-mediators/index.html,Israel’s political leaders steering ceasefire talks frustrate mediators,2025-04-10 20:43:16,"When discussions began over releasing Israeli hostages shortly after the October 7 attack by Hamas, the negotiators tasked to strike a deal were mostly intelligence and security professionals. But in February, Israel made an important change that those now involved say has had a profound slowing effect on the discussions to resurrect the broken ceasefire: The file was taken over by the prime minister’s closest political aide, Ron Dermer.
With Dermer, says a source involved in the negotiations, there’s a “significant difference in momentum,” from when Israel’s team was led by intelligence chiefs David Barnea and Ronen Bar.
“There is a clear shift in [Israeli] priorities,” the source said. “Negotiations are seemingly being politicized from the Israeli team.”
Now, Barnea, who directs the Mossad, has been sidelined and Bar, who ran the internal security service Shin Bet, has been fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, causing an uproar in Israel.
The decision to push aside career national security professionals in favor of Netanyahu’s closest adviser was intended to give Netanyahu more control over the negotiation process, an Israeli source familiar with the negotiations said.
“The political considerations of the Israeli team led by Dermer is not having a positive impact,” says an American who advocates for the families of Israeli hostages. “The families understand that Dermer is a big problem to getting their loved ones.”
An Israeli official pushed back on claims that Dermer’s position at the helm of negotiations has hampered progress or politicized the negotiations, saying, “Negotiations need to be judged by results, not process.”
“To reach a deal, you need someone who actually represents the will of the government that will authorize said deal, not ‘dissent,’ which only served to undermine negotiations,” the official said.
The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that started as President Donald Trump took office collapsed last month when Israel re-launched its military operations and US and Israeli officials accused Hamas of rejecting a deal to extend it, which Hamas denied.
There had long been indications Israel planned to resume its war against Hamas after the first phase of the ceasefire deal, when 38 Israeli and Thai hostages were released over six weeks.
Netanyahu regularly cites freeing the hostages as a top priority. But so is the destruction of Hamas, and critics have accused him of prioritizing the latter at the expense of the former, namely because that is also where the prime minister’s political interests lie.
Destroying Hamas has long been the priority of key right-wing members of Netanyahu’s governing coalition, who have invariably threatened and followed through on threats to quit the government.
With Dermer in charge of the negotiations, Netanyahu can more deftly manage the delicate political balancing act that has influenced Israeli decision-making at every critical turn of the ceasefire negotiations.
During the many months of ceasefire negotiations last year that ultimately led to a ceasefire deal in January, Israeli security officials balked at Netanyahu’s shifting positions and stall tactics that they believed were influenced by political considerations and delayed the brokering of a deal. But with Dermer now in charge and intelligence leaders marginalized, those dissenting views have featured less prominently in Israeli security discussions and in Israeli press reports.
While in the US to meet Trump earlier this week, Netanyahu rejected accusations that freeing the hostages isn’t a top priority.
“The president looked at me and told the journalists who were present: ‘This man is working constantly to free the hostages.’ I hope that this shatters the lie that is being circulated to the effect that I am not working for them, that I don’t care. I do care, and I am doing it and we will be successful,” Netanyahu said.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel recently made a direct appeal to Dermer, whose title is the Minister of Strategic Affairs, accusing him of leaving them “in complete darkness.”
“When you were appointed as head of the negotiating team, we were promised that this would help reach a breakthrough on a new agreement,” the letter said. “In reality, more than a month has passed and there is no progress in sight.”
Barnea and Bar had regularly shuttled to Egypt and Qatar, as well as other countries, for ceasefire talks that included the heads of the CIA, Egyptian intelligence and the prime minister of Qatar.
Now Dermer speaks less with mediators from Egypt and Qatar, which maintain direct relationships with Hamas, according to the source involved in the negotiations.
The US point person has also shifted from the former CIA director to the Trump administration’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who has accused Hamas of intransigence that caused the recent ceasefire to break down.
“If you’re the Trump team, you blame Hamas but behind the scenes I believe they are trying to push both sides,” the American who works with the hostage families said.
A spokesperson for Witkoff said in a statement, “Ambassador Witkoff and the Trump administration are in lockstep with Israel in their pursuit of freeing the hostages, including American Edan Alexander, and achieving peace – which means Hamas out of power in Gaza. To achieve this, difficult negotiations are necessary.”
Ongoing negotiations to release hostages
Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler have tried to figure out formulas to get Hamas to release the remaining Americans – one living and four dead – and get the truce extended enough to try to negotiate the next phase.
“The US is doing everything possible to release alive and deceased US hostages, which necessitates the deal,” said an Egyptian official. While Israel “doesn’t see hostages superseding breaking Hamas.”
Most recently, Hamas agreed to an Egypt- and Qatar-backed proposal that mirrored one Witkoff presented last month to release the lone living American hostage, Edan Alexander, along with four others and extend the peace through Ramadan and Passover.
Israel quickly countered, demanding 11 living hostages, almost half of the 24 remaining. That would more dramatically cut into what Hamas views as their greatest leverage over Israel.
“We’re still working on the Witkoff plan for an extension,” said a diplomat familiar with the discussions. “I think we have some wiggle room that we can work on.”
Israel had early in the ceasefire delayed launching negotiations for the second phase whose terms stipulated the release of all remaining hostages, a permanent ceasefire and a withdrawal by Israel’s military from Gaza.
That could have meant the survival of Hamas – even if not in power - and flown in the face of Netanyahu’s goal of “total victory.” It would also have threatened Netanyahu’s government.
Those second phase talks never began.
“There’s no clarity on the [Israeli] objective,” the first source involved in the talks said, adding: “Americans are getting impatient.”
As Israel’s latest operations have taken the death toll in Gaza over 50,000, there has been promising movement to resurrect the truce, those involved say.
Hamas is feeling the pressure, both from Israel’s military and widescale protests by Palestinians in Gaza, said a US official familiar with the negotiations.
“Hamas is struggling for oxygen,” said the official who accused Hamas of missing American opportunities last month to keep the ceasefire going. “They’re not very quick to move.”
The American working with the hostage families has felt “some air being breathed back into the process.”
“There’s a real sense of urgency and push on the part of the Americans and the [Egyptian and Qatari] mediators,” the source involved in the negotiations said.
To try to salvage the ceasefire, hostage envoy Boehler made an unprecedented move: meeting directly with officials from Hamas, which the US considers a terrorist organization.
That meeting angered Israeli officials, and reportedly Dermer in particular. Boehler confirmed he spoke with Dermer after and defended the meeting, telling CNN: “we’re not an agent of Israel.”
With much of Hamas’ leadership inside Gaza decimated, it’s not clear if the military leaders still fighting Israel are on the same page as the political leadership engaging with mediators, including Boehler, the source involved in the negotiations said.
“Stubbornness in Hamas also unhelpful. They need to account for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza,” the source said.
Meanwhile, the discussions continue with the Israeli team led by Dermer, but which still includes security professionals working on the technical details.
“The Israeli team is putting a lot of effort, but the way it’s being managed tactically from the top,” the source said, “the current structure of the negotiation team is not as helpful as needed for progress.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/middleeast/ahmad-manasra-release-intl-latam/index.html,Ahmad Manasra: Israel releases Palestinian prisoner arrested at age 13 after nearly a decade,2025-04-10 18:23:50,"Israel has released a Palestinian man who was controversially arrested at the age of 13, after he spent nearly a decade in jail.
Ahmad Manasra has been reunited with his family, his lawyer Khaled Zabarqa told CNN.
“Ahmad has completed his 10-year sentence and he is a free person now,” Zabarqa said. “The Israeli authorities have imposed restriction on the family as far as holding a welcome ceremony for Ahmad or talking to the media. “
Ahmad Manasra was arrested and imprisoned in 2015 after being caught with his cousin Hassan who stabbed two Israelis in East Jerusalem.
Hassan was shot dead at the scene while Manasra was run over by a car.
Manasra’s case gained international attention after a video emerged of crowds shouting abuse at him after the incident while he lies motionless, seriously injured and crying out. Other footage allegedly shows Israeli officials interrogating Manasra under duress as he is visibly shaken and vulnerable, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society.
He was sentenced to 12 years for attempted murder in 2016, despite Israeli courts’ recognizing he had not been involved in the stabbings, the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society added. His sentence was revised down to nine and a half years following an appeal in 2017
International groups have repeatedly called on Israeli authorities for his release over the years over concerns of his treatment and extended stays in solitary confinement, coupled with mental health issues and a schizophrenia diagnosis.
“His physical and medical condition is very difficult as he suffers from head injuries and physiological mental health as he was in solitary confinement and was subjected to harsh interrogation when he was a child,” his lawyer said.

In a letter published in Israel’s major newspapers, hundreds of Air Force reservists and retirees said the IDF is fighting a war for political purposes without a military goal.
“At this time, the war mainly serves political and personal interests and not security interests,” the group wrote. “The continuation of the war does not contribute to any of its stated goals and will lead to the death of abductees, IDF soldiers and innocent civilians, and to the attrition of reservists.” The letter says the signatures include pilots and air crew. The letter didn’t call for a refusal to serve.
The public letter is another sign of the growing discontent within Israel at the continuation of the war after 18 months and the failure to return the remaining 59 hostages still held captive in Gaza. Nearly 70% of Israelis support ending the war in exchange as part of a deal to free the remaining hostages, according to a recent poll by Israel’s Channel 12.
Israeli reservists have become increasingly vocal since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas last month and returned to war, feeling the personal and financial strain of multiple tours of reserve duty and questioning the Israeli government’s commitment to negotiating a return of the hostages. The simmering frustration is a potential issue for a military that relies heavily on reservists in wartime.
The IDF Chief of Staff and the Air Force commander decided to fire the reservists who had signed the letter, including those who in active service. It’s unclear how many of the hundreds of signatories are active or reserve, but the IDF said it was analyzing the list to see how many more are still in the military.
“It is impossible for someone who works a shift in (an Air Force) pit to later come out and express a lack of confidence in the mission. This is an impossible anomaly,” the IDF said in a statement. An IDF official said most of the signatories are not active reservists.
Reservist navigator Alon Gur, whose name appears on the letter, was permanently dismissed last month, according to the IDF, after he said on social media that Israel had reached the point where “the state again abandons its citizens in broad daylight” and “where the king becomes more important than the kingdom,” according to widespread reports in Israeli media. Gur, who posted the statement the day Israel relaunched military operations in Gaza, said he had informed his squadron commander that he was leaving the military.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz slammed the letter and lauded the decision to fire the signatories.
Netanyahu cast the letter as written by “an extreme fringe group that is once again trying to break Israeli society from within.”
“Refusal is refusal—whether it is stated explicitly or disguised in euphemistic language,” he said in a statement.
Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has threatened to quit Netanyahu’s government if the war ends, congratulated the IDF Chief of Staff and the Air Force commander for ousting the “refuseniks” – a term used for those refusing to serve in the military.
“This swift action is essential to make it clear that we will not again accept refusals and calls for rebellion against the IDF,” he wrote on social media.
The move to clamp down on the public protest appeared aimed at stemming increasingly vocal discontent among reservists and preventing a repeat of 2023, when waves of reservists said they would refuse to serve in protest of Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul efforts
Nearly all of those reservists ultimately answered call-ups they received after Israel was attacked on October 7, but that wartime unity has begun to falter as the war has dragged on.","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Jeremy Diamond']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/world/israel-raids-east-jerusalem-schools-closures-intl/index.html,Israel orders closure of six UN schools in East Jerusalem after raids,2025-04-09 13:29:38,"Israeli forces raided six United Nations schools in East Jerusalem, ordering them to close within 30 days, according to UNRWA, the UN agency for the Palestinian refugees, and the Israeli Ministry of Education.
Approximately 800 students will be directly impacted by the closure orders and may not be able to finish the school year, UNRWA’s Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said on social media. Schools run by the agency serve Palestinians in areas occupied by Israel, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.
“UNRWA schools are protected by the privileges and immunities of the United Nations,” Lazzarini said. “Today’s unauthorized entries and issuance of closure orders are a violation of these protections.”
Israel’s Ministry of Education said in a statement that parents were directed to register their students at other schools. “The professional staff at the Ministry of Education continue to support the educational framework for each student.”
In October, Israel’s parliament passed a law banning UNRWA from activity within Israel and revoking the 1967 treaty that allowed the agency to carry out its mission.
Yulia Malinovsky, a member of the Israeli parliament who sponsored the bill to ban UNRWA, confirmed the closure orders. The schools will have until May 8, she said.
“We’re also working very hard to close the water and electricity to all of UNRWA’s facilities (in areas occupied by Israel),” Malinovsky said. “We’re doing everything we can to implement the UNRWA bills fully in all institutions and in all aspects.”
Israel has long sought to dismantle the UN agency, arguing that some of its employees are members of Hamas and that UNRWA’s education system teaches students to hate Israel.
A UN-commissioned inquiry found that examples in textbooks of anti-Israel bias were “marginal” but nonetheless constituted “a grave violation of neutrality.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have alleged that a handful of UNRWA’s 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the October 7 massacre. UNRWA has repeatedly denied these accusations, saying there is “absolutely no ground for a blanket description of ‘the institution as a whole’ being ‘totally infiltrated.’”
UNRWA was founded by the United Nations a year after the 1948 creation of Israel that led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in an event known by Palestinians as the “Nakba” (catastrophe).
The agency, which began by assisting about 750,000 Palestinian refugees in 1950, now serves some 5.9 million across the Middle East, many of whom live in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem as well as in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria.
In the Gaza Strip, which has been ravaged by a devastating Israeli war for more than a year, UNRWA serves some 1.7 million Palestinian refugees. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it assists around 871,500 refugees.
Deadly airstrike in Gaza City
On Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed at least 23 Palestinians, including eight children, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense, as the Israeli military said it targeted a senior Hamas militant.
The strike destroyed a four-story residential building in the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood in Gaza City and wounded at least 60 others, the Civil Defense said. More than 30 Palestinians are also missing under the rubble, the organization said, including 19 members from one family.
“I was heading out to fill water and, on my return back, all of a sudden an entire block was targeted with women and children,” said Hatem Jundyeh, who lives nearby. “What have we done? Are we Hamas so they strike us?”
On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency said they struck a “command and control center” in the Gaza City area, killing Haitham Razek Abd al-Karim Sheikh Khalil, who they said commanded the Hamas infiltration into the southern Israeli community of Nir Oz on October 7, 2023.
In the aftermath of the strike, rescue crews searched under the debris for any signs of life. One group pulled the body of young boy from the rubble, his body limp and his face bloodied. Another crew nearby tried to jackhammer through enormous slabs of destroyed concrete in a race to save anyone who might still be trapped.
“What tools do we have? The entire world is fighting us,” said one volunteer with the Civil Defense. “We recovered a body of a child, but next to him there – his brothers and parents and siblings. The entire world is watching with silence.”
Ambulances quickly filled with the wounded in a rush for medical treatment. At the hospital, Palestinians killed in the strike were wrapped in white cloths or rugs.
Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza, said on social media that one of “the most harrowing cases I’ve witnessed during this war” was a 20-year-old woman who had both breasts and an arm amputated. “What crime did she commit to deserve such brutal disfigurement and the shattering of her future?” Naim asked.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they struck a “senior Hamas terrorist” who planned and carried out attacks from northern Gaza. “Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate harm to civilians including the use of precise weapons, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence,” the IDF said in a statement after the strike. The IDF did not identify the target of the strike.
The strike in northern Gaza comes as the IDF expands its operations in Rafah in the southern portion of the coastal enclave, as a source familiar with the matter tells CNN Israel is planning to hold a significant portion of Gaza for an “indefinite” period of time.
Last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced a major expansion of the military’s operation in Gaza involving the seizure of large areas of land that would be “incorporated into Israel’s security zones.”
The operation would also involve “large-scale evacuation of Gaza’s population from combat zones,” his statement said without specifying details. Katz said the military operation would expand to “crush and clear the area of terrorists and terror infrastructure, while seizing large areas that will be incorporated into Israel’s security zone.”",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/middleeast/israel-gaza-buffer-zone-troops-intl/index.html,Israeli soldiers reveal systematic destruction of Palestinian property to create Gaza buffer zone,2025-04-07 14:43:59,"Israel’s military has transformed every bit of Gazan territory within about half a mile of the Israeli border into a wasteland.
Armored bulldozers have systematically leveled one home after another. Combat engineers have laid explosives and triggered controlled demolitions inside once-bustling factories. Troops have torn up and denied Palestinians any access to the fertile farmland that once sustained lives and livelihoods.
In its place, the Israeli military has established a roughly 1-kilometer-wide buffer zone (about 0.6 miles) from which it has banished Palestinians and killed or fired at those who do set foot within its unmarked perimeter – all of which it has never officially acknowledged.
Now, in interviews with CNN and testimonials to an Israeli watchdog group, Israeli soldiers who were deployed to Gaza are revealing how the military carried out the destruction of civilian infrastructure to create the buffer area and the loose rules of engagement that have allegedly resulted in Israeli troops firing on and killing unarmed Palestinians.
These testimonies reveal Israeli military practices that arguably violate international humanitarian law and, in some cases are war crimes, according to international law experts.
After publication, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed to CNN that it has established a “broad military presence in the security zone adjacent to Israel,” which it called a “vital component” to prevent another October 7-style attack.
“These actions are essential in order to prevent Hamas and other terrorist organizations from operating in the area while ensuring the security of IDF forces and Israeli communities,” the IDF said in a statement, insisting its actions are “in accordance with international law.”
When Sergeant 1st Class “A” arrived in the industrial zone of Gaza City’s Shujaiya neighborhood in December 2023, many of the warehouses and factories had already been destroyed. But others were still standing.
“Our job was to make more of the first kind,” the sergeant told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity because he risks reprisals for speaking out publicly. “We destroyed them one by one in a very methodical fashion – area by area.”
After initially deploying to Israeli communities along the Gaza border to shore up their defenses following Hamas’s October 7 attack, Sgt. “A” was sent to Shujaiya and tasked with protecting combat engineers as they bulldozed buildings and rigged others to explode.
The purpose of the destruction was quickly made clear to him and his fellow soldiers: Israel was enlarging the buffer zone separating Palestinians from Israeli communities along the Gaza border.
Before October 7, Israel restricted Palestinians from coming within 300 meters (around 980 feet) of the border fence. But after Hamas’s attack, Israel’s military brass soon put into motion a plan to expand that area to approximately 1 kilometer, establishing a clear line of sight through the expanded buffer zone by leveling territory ranging from 800m to 1.5 km from the border.
In testimony provided to Breaking the Silence, an Israeli watchdog group which vets and publishes military testimonials, multiple soldiers said they were told the mission was to dramatically expand the buffer zone, in order to prevent another border attack.
But international law experts say that justification likely fails to meet the bar of “military necessity” that must be met to justify the destruction of civilian property, likely putting Israel’s actions in violation of international humanitarian law.
“There needs to be a legitimate military objective and operational objective – and the only way to achieve it would be to destroy the civilian property. And so, at that scale, that’s simply not quite plausible,” said Janina Dill, co-director at Oxford University’s Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.
Beyond potential violations of humanitarian law, the deliberate, widespread destruction of civilian property without a clear military necessity is a war crime, Dill said.
Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, a professor of public international law at the University of Bristol, agreed there is a strong case that Israel’s widespread destruction of property is a war crime of wanton destruction, an accusation also leveled by Amnesty International and other human rights groups.
“(From) what I’ve seen so far – there’s no clear evidence of a military necessity, at least for the level of destruction that’s been caused by Israel,” Hill-Cawthorne said.
While the Israeli military has acknowledged destroying “terrorist infrastructure” in Gaza in order to improve security conditions for Israeli communities near the border, it has never publicly acknowledged a full-throated plan to destroy thousands of buildings to create a kilometer-wide buffer area inside the territory.
But soldiers interviewed by CNN and Breaking the Silence said the buffer zone policy was just that: an unambiguous, centralized, top-down strategy.
“I knew other units were doing the same up north and then down south. I knew it came from up high,” Sgt. “A” told CNN. “When the engineering corps and the infantry work together, it can’t be the initiative of a small commander because a small commander doesn’t have access to the engineering corps.”
A Sergeant Major who was deployed to Khuza’a in southern Gaza, who also spoke to Breaking the Silence on condition of anonymity, said his brigade got its orders “from the division’s operations branch. It wasn’t some local intervention.” He and others also described the distribution of color-coded maps, marking varying levels of destruction so far achieved in the buffer zone.
The destruction in Khuza’a, which lies to the east of Khan Younis, is unmistakable in satellite imagery, with the destruction of hundreds of buildings cleaving a line marking the zone’s perimeter.
“Residential buildings, greenhouses, sheds, factories; you name it – it needs to be flat. That’s the order,” said the Sgt. Maj. in the 5th infantry brigade who deployed to Khuza’a. “Except for that UNRWA school and that small water facility – for everything else, the directive was ‘nothing left.’”
The Israeli military has since destroyed more than 6,200 buildings in Gaza within 1 kilometer of the border, according to satellite analysis conducted by Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, researchers at the City University of New York and Oregon State University.
Adi Ben-Nun, a researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said as of January, “all buildings in the buffer zone were demolished or heavily damaged.”
‘Kill zone’
For Palestinians, setting foot inside the buffer zone can be a death sentence.
Multiple soldiers described rules of engagement that authorized them to fire on Palestinians in the zone, regardless of whether they were armed or identified as combatants.
“Adult, male – kill. Shoot to kill. For women and children, shoot to drive away,” a Sergeant 1st Class in Israel’s Armored Corps said in an interview with Breaking the Silence provided to CNN.
“The reservists also always raised questions over whether this was communicated to them (the Palestinians): ‘Do they know such a thing exists?’” the Sgt. 1st Class said.
He said commanders never provided a clear answer, but the reality was clear. “It’s not like they were told: The ridge before the border is (the line),” he said.
While the buffer zone can be clearly seen in satellite imagery, its perimeter can be hard to discern on the ground and multiple Palestinians have been shot for entering the area, according to the testimonial of Israeli soldiers to Breaking the Silence and Palestinians in Gaza. Even during the ceasefire, CNN tracked multiple cases of Palestinians who were shot and killed for crossing invisible lines near the buffer zone where troops were stationed.
A Warrant Officer in the Armored Corps described Palestinians being shot for trying to pick khubeiza or mallow, an edible plant.
“People were incriminated for having bags in their hands,” the Warrant Officer told Breaking the Silence. “Guy showed up with a bag? Incriminated, terrorist. I believe they came to pick khubeiza, but (the army says), ‘No, they’re hiding.’ Boom.” He said a tank fired at them from about 800 meters, narrowly missing.
“A kill zone is in essence the announcement of a party to the war that they won’t take feasible precautions, that they won’t verify the status of an individual before attacking them. And that definitely violates international law,” said Dill, of Oxford University.
“Simply being present in a certain part of a combat theater does not amount to active participation in hostilities. And only active participation in hostilities makes a civilian lose their protection under international law.”
Hill-Cawthorne was equally unequivocal.
“A civilian does not lose their protected status, their immunity from attack merely because they enter an area that they’re not allowed or that they’re told not to enter,” Hill-Cawthorne said. “The only way in which people lose that immunity from attack is if they directly participate in hostilities.”
In its statement to CNN, the IDF said: “Warnings to the civilian population in the combat zones of the Gaza Strip are issued with the goal of mitigating harm to civilians. The IDF’s operations target military objectives and terrorists, in accordance with international law.”
‘It was like paradise’
For 40 years, Abdul Aziz al-Nabahin grew olives, oranges and guavas on five acres of land he had inherited from his ancestors on the outskirts of Al-Bureij, in central Gaza – about 600 meters from the Israeli border.
His son Mahmoud recently married and had a 3-year-old daughter.
“It was like paradise,” al-Nabahin said. “We used to say, thank God. We were settled and satisfied.”
After being forced to flee earlier in the war, he returned to his farm during the January ceasefire only to find his home and farmland in ruins.
“We found the house destroyed. The trees were bulldozed,” he said. “We didn’t know where to sit, so we just stayed outside in the open.”
But he has lost so much more.
In late June, al-Nabahin said Mahmoud had gone to collect firewood near their home when he was killed. An Israeli tank shell struck him and his cousin, who was grievously injured but survived.
“The Israelis deliberately targeted them. They knew they were only collecting wood – not resisting or fighting. Just a cart with wood, clearly visible. Still, they were targeted,” al-Nabahin said.
“They kill anyone who goes there.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/middleeast/analysis-netanyahu-trump-tariffs-iran-intl-latam/index.html,Netanyahu met Trump seeking wins on tariffs and Iran. He returns to Israel empty-handed,2025-04-09 10:00:57,"If Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking for the easy political victories that once gushed from US President Donald Trump, he left the Oval Office empty-handed.
The meeting was supposed to be about the two leaders negotiating the new 17% tariff the White House imposed on Israeli exports last week. In a gamble to avoid them, Israel had dropped its own tariffs on American products to zero a day earlier, even though they were only imposed on very few items.
Seated next to Trump in the White House, Netanyahu said Israel would eliminate trade barriers and trade deficits “very quickly.” With his usual effusive praise of Trump, the long-serving Israeli leader said, “We are going to eliminate the tariffs and rapidly.”
It made no difference to Trump. He pointed out that Israel gets $4 billion a year from the United States - “Congratulations, by the way. That’s pretty good,” he said – but he would not commit to changing his plans.
“Maybe not, maybe not,” he said when asked if he would reduce the tariffs.
For years, Netanyahu grew accustomed to political gifts from Trump, especially during the first Trump administration. Moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing the occupied Golan Heights as part of Israel, normalizing relations between Israel and two Arab Gulf countries, and many more - Netanyahu was always eager to celebrate these decisions and the president who made them.
Netanyahu was quick to point out that he was not only the first foreign leader to visit Trump during his second term, he was also the first to meet him to negotiate tariffs. But this meeting left Netanyahu with no clear deliverables or US promises for which he could take credit.
The biggest blow of all was on one of Netanyahu’s favorite topic: Iran. For days before the highly anticipated meeting, Israeli media were rife with speculation that the two leaders would discuss military strikes on Iran. The top Sunday headline in Israel’s most prominent newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, shouted “IRAN FIRST” and said the Islamic Republic would need to suffer a “heavy blow” before negotiating. The presence of at least six US B-2 stealth bombers in the Indian Ocean and a second aircraft carrier in the Middle East only fueled speculation in Israel that a strike was not only possible, but increasingly probable.
Ultimately, the biggest headline was about Iran, but almost certainly not in the way Netanyahu expected.
Trump announced that the US and Iran were about to begin talks on the potential for a new nuclear agreement. Netanyahu has been aware that Trump was pursuing talks with Iran, but the sudden revelation of the imminent talks - set to begin Saturday - appeared to surprise the prime minister. The smile quickly vanished from his face as he looked toward his team of advisers.
The announcement was “certainly not” to Israel’s liking, two sources told CNN. It’s unclear if Netanyahu was given advance notice of the US-Iran talks or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources added.
Before flying back to Israel, Netanyahu laid out his position.
“We agree that Iran will not have nuclear weapons. This can be done by an agreement, but only if this agreement is Libyan style,” he said, referring to a 2003 deal under which Libya voluntarily agreed to fully dismantle its nascent nuclear program. But if Iran drags out the talks, Netanyahu said he discussed the military option “at length” with Trump.
In Israel, the damage was already done.
“If (Trump) started the negotiation without our knowledge, it means that he’s going to represent the American interest only,” said Ronni Shaked, a researcher with the Truman Institute at Hebrew University. If Israel knew in advance, Netanyahu could have contributed with “some ideas, some new facts, some new intelligence,” Shaked said. “But here it’s nothing, nothing at all.”
Trump’s effusive praise of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – one of Israel’s most vociferous critics since the start of the war in Gaza – was another surprising line in a press conference full of them.
Last year, Erdogan called on God to “punish” Netanyahu and said at an election rally, “We will send the person called Netanyahu to Allah.” For months, Erdogan has kept up a steady stream of anti-Israel – and specifically anti-Netanyahu – rhetoric.
Sitting right next to Netanyahu, Trump heaped praise on Erdogan. “I have great relations with a man named Erdogan,” Trump said. “He’s a tough guy. He’s very smart.” Trump said he thought he could work out any disagreement between Turkey and Israel.
“I think it was especially embarrassing for Netanyahu, because last week, Erdogan said he thinks Israel should be destroyed or eliminated,” said Alon Liel, Israel’s former ambassador to Turkey. “It was a very small part (of the press conference), but very meaningful.”
During a speech marking the Muslim holiday of Eid al Fitr on March 31, Erdogan called on God to “condemn Israel to misery.”
Trump did give Netanyahu some political cover back home. The two leaders said they’re working on another deal to bring Israeli hostages back from Gaza. Trump said Netanyahu was working on it constantly, even as the Israeli leader faces continued criticism that he’s not doing enough to return the hostages.
Trump said he’d like to see the war stop “and I think the war will stop at some point, that won’t be in the too-distant future.” For Netanyahu, a ceasefire would be a poisoned chalice, since his government relies on the support of far-right parties that adamantly oppose an end to the war.
Referring to Netanyahu by his nickname, Shaked said, “Bibi is coming back home with empty, empty hands. Not Iran, not Gaza, not the kidnapped people. Nothing at all.”","['Oren Liebermann', 'Dana Karni']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/middleeast/palestinian-american-teen-killed-israel-intl-hnk/index.html,"Palestinian American teen shot dead by Israeli soldiers in West Bank, official says",2025-04-07 00:00:00,"Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian-American teenager and wounded two others in the occupied West Bank on Sunday night, according to Palestinian officials, after the Israeli military said it targeted a group throwing stones at cars.
Ramallah governor Laila Ghannam said the 14-year-old Palestinian-American boy was shot dead by Israeli troops in the village of Turmusaya. Two other Palestinian-American boys, ages 14 and 15, were injured in the incident, according to the mayor of Turmusaya, Lafi Shalabi.
The Israeli military said its soldiers opened fire during a counterterrorism operation in Turmusaya when they saw three “terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving.”
The soldiers killed one and hit the other two, the military said.
The military shared a blurry video purportedly showing the incident, in which three figures are seen. At the end of the short clip, one of the figures appears to hurl an object. The Israeli military said it would continue operating in the West Bank “to protect the residents in the area.”
The injured boys were shot in the abdomen, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
One severely injured boy and another with minor wounds were taken to a hospital in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said.
The killing of a Palestinian-American teenager came just hours before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in the United States to meet President Donald Trump. On Monday a US State Department spokesperson confirmed the death of a US citizen in the West Bank, offered condolences to the family and noted the death “occurred during a counter-terrorism operation” and that the Israeli military was investigating.
“Out of respect for the privacy of the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment at this time,” the spokesperson said. And on Tuesday US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the US needs “to learn more about the nature of what happened on the ground.”
The teenager grew up in New Jersey, according to Governor Phil Murphy, who expressed his condolences for the boy’s family.
The killing or detention of American citizens in occupied Palestinian territories by Israelis and concerns about a lack of accountability date back years. In 2003, American activist Rachel Corrie, 23, was crushed by an Israeli army bulldozer while trying to block it from razing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Nine years later, an Israeli civil court ruled her death an accident.
In spring 2022, prominent Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed while reporting in the West Bank. That November, Defense Minister Benny Gantz confirmed that Israel would not cooperate with a US probe into her death. A CNN investigation suggested that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces, despite wearing a vest marked “Press.”
In February last year, Florida-born US citizen Mohammed Khdour, 17, was killed by Israeli forces who shot him in the head while he was in his car. The teenager was taking the car out during a study break, snacking on chocolate waffles, posing for Instagram.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) referred questions about Khdour’s case to the Israeli Security Agency, known as the Shin Bet, which did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
Three weeks before Khdour’s death, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, a 17-year-old Palestinian-American who grew up in Louisiana, was also shot in the head by apparent Israeli gunmen. The IDF told CNN they received a report that an off-duty police officer and an Israeli civilian shot at a Palestinian “suspected of throwing stones” – which his family vehemently denied – and that the Israeli Police were investigating the shooting.
Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank have intensified since late January following the launch of an expanded military campaign there almost immediately after the Gaza ceasefire began. Since then, roughly 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced from their homes.
The Israeli military says it is targeting Palestinian militant groups who have mounted attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, but Palestinians and human rights groups say the expanded assault is increasingly indiscriminate – killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in a manner consistent with collective punishment. In late February, Israel deployed tanks to the occupied West Bank for the first time in two decades.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/middleeast/gaza-aid-workers-killed-audio-intl-invs/index.html,Audio and video capture last moments of Gaza aid workers killed in Israeli attack,2025-04-07 21:31:27,"When paramedic Hassan Hosni Al-Hila felt too sick to continue his late-night assignment with the Palestine Red Crescent Society on March 23, his son gladly agreed to cover his shift.
That shift would prove to be 21-year-old Mohammad’s last.
Within a few hours, while the young paramedic was dispatched with a convoy of emergency vehicles to find a missing ambulance crew in Rafah, southern Gaza, Mohammad called his father pleading for help amidst intense Israeli military gunfire.
“’Come to me, Dad, help me… we were targeted by the Israelis, and they are now shooting at us directly,” Al-Hila recalled his son telling him over the phone. “The call ended after that.”
His fate would remain unknown for over a week, until rescue teams granted permission by the Israeli military to access the area uncovered a horrific scene: a mass grave containing the bodies of 15 first responders buried along with their crushed emergency vehicles.
A growing trove of evidence detailing the final moments of the first responders has blown apart the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) initial narrative of what unfolded that day, in which it claimed without offering evidence that some vehicles were moving suspiciously without headlights or flashing lights toward the Israeli troops and that members of the emergency teams were militants.
A CNN review of video capturing the gunfire, photos and satellite imagery of the site, along with interviews with forensic experts and family members provides a detailed account of the Israeli military’s targeting and burial of clearly marked rescue crews from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, Civil Defense, and the United Nations. A CNN interview with a survivor of the attack and exclusive audio from a medical worker recorded in his final moments also contradict Israel’s account.
The IDF said it had begun re-investigating the incident after footage emerged Friday showing ambulances and a fire truck traveling with their emergency signal lights on. After being briefed on the preliminary inquiry, the IDF Chief of Staff on Monday ordered the initial inquiry be “pursued in greater depth” through an “investigation mechanism” and completed within days. The video, first published by The New York Times, was obtained by CNN from the PRCS.
“All the claims raised regarding the incident will be examined through the mechanism and presented in a detailed and thorough manner for a decision on how to handle the event,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.
According to an Israeli military official, troops from a brigade that had set up an ambush opened fire on the emergency crews that morning, after intelligence had deemed their movements “suspicious,” and believed they had successfully carried out an attack on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants.
Family members and colleagues of the slain paramedics vehemently deny that any of the workers were militants and are calling for an independent investigation into the killings.
On seeing his son’s body, which Hosni said was riddled with bullet holes, he apologized for not being beside him in his final moments, saying their ambulances would have been dispatched together.
“I told him, ‘I’m sorry I couldn’t join you,’” Hosni recalls. “If I hadn’t returned home, [he] and I would have been together on the same mission.”
‘The gasp of death’
The chain of events began in the early hours of Sunday, March 23, following reports of an Israeli strike in Rafah. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) dispatched an ambulance with three crew members to respond to the scene.
PRCS said they did not coordinate the dispatch with COGAT, the Israeli military agency overseeing activities in the Palestinian territories, because the area was not designated as a “red zone” where coordination is required. Hours after the attack, the IDF designated the area as a “red zone” as part of its expanded operation in Rafah.
According to PRCS medic Munther Abed – who was sitting in the back of the ambulance en route to the scene – the crew was suddenly targeted with heavy, direct gunfire by Israeli forces. Abed said he survived the attack by throwing himself to the floor of the vehicle for cover, hearing the pained yells of his colleagues in the front, both of whom were killed.
“I couldn’t hear anything from my colleagues except the sound of death, the gasp of death, their last breath,” Abed told CNN. “A cry of pain, that’s all I heard from them.”
The ambulance crashed into a power pole, coming to a stop along with the gunfire, according to Abed. He said Israeli soldiers opened the back doors of the vehicle and detained him outside, stripping him down to his underwear.
An Israeli military official said the troops shot at a vehicle at 4 a.m., killing two individuals and detaining another, all of whom the IDF claimed without providing evidence were Hamas security officials. The official also denied that the vehicle was an ambulance or that the individuals were uniformed paramedics. Abed, who said he was released later that day from Israeli custody after the military checked his records, rejects those claims.
Once communication with Abed’s crew was lost, PRCS dispatched additional ambulances alongside Civil Defense vehicles to check on the missing team.
However, the support crews would meet the same, grim fate. A newly released video discovered on the phone of one of the 15 deceased ambulance and relief team members captured their final moments before being killed by the Israeli military.
The video is filmed from the front of a vehicle and shows a convoy of clearly marked ambulances moving along a road at dawn, with headlights and flashing emergency lights on.
The video shows the convoy stopping when it comes across another vehicle that had seemingly crashed into a power pole on the side of the road. Dr. Younis Al-Khatib, president of the PRCS, confirmed in a press briefing on Monday that the vehicle seen in the footage was one of the agency’s ambulances.
Two of the rescuers seen in the footage getting out of the vehicles are wearing reflective, PRCS emergency responder uniforms. A fire truck and an ambulance at the scene are marked with the PRCS insignia.
Almost immediately there is intense gunfire, which can be heard hitting the convoy. The video ends, but the audio continues for five minutes.
Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member, told CNN that the gunfire heard in the footage was consistent with small arms and light weapons. “Even while using night vision the lights from the vehicles in the convoy would be noticeable,” he added.
The paramedic filming the incident, identified by the PRCS as Rifaat Radwan, is heard repeatedly saying the “shahada,” which Muslims recite when facing death, and says he knows he is going to die.
At one point he says: “Forgive me mom, this is the path I chose – to help people – I swear I didn’t choose this path but to help people.”
The voices of others in the convoy can also be heard, as well as those of people shouting commands in Hebrew. It’s unclear who they are or what they are saying.
Another medic who was on the second dispatch, Ashraf Abu Libda, made a call at 4:55 a.m. to a colleague as the convoy came under fire. An audio recording of the call, obtained by CNN, captures him repeating the shahada before saying “there are soldiers, there are soldiers here.” A soldier can be heard in the background, saying “come, come, come” in Hebrew.
The call casts doubt over the timeline laid out by the Israeli soldiers involved in the attack, who said the rescue convoy arrived two hours after the initial ambulance, at 6 a.m., according to the Israeli military official. The video also shows the convoy arriving in darkness, with the first rays of sunlight visible on the horizon, indicating it was filmed before 6 a.m. – sunrise on March 23 in Gaza was at 5:42 a.m.
Following the deadly attacks, Abed – who told CNN he was beaten and abused by Israeli soldiers during interrogations near the scene – said he witnessed the IDF’s burial of the bodies and vehicles, seeing bulldozers dig a large pit, crush the vehicles and pile them into the hole.
An Israeli military official told CNN last week that Israeli forces buried the bodies of the workers because they expected it would take time to coordinate their retrieval with the PRCS and the UN, and they wanted to prevent the bodies being eaten by animals. One forensic expert who reviewed images of the badly damaged bodies said that their state of decomposition suggested they may have been scavenged on by dogs.
Satellite imagery from March 23, first published by Al Jazeera Arabic and analyzed by CNN, shows Israeli army vehicles surrounding a cluster of five ambulances from the PRCS and Civil Defense. Bulldozer tracks and activity are clearly visible in the image.
Another satellite image, also published by Al Jazeera and analyzed by CNN, dated March 25, shows an Israeli tank, an excavator, and military bulldozers at the same location. Where the ambulances once stood, remnants of vehicles protruded from disturbed ground.
Ball told CNN that images of the excavation point to a direct gunfire attack and crushing by heavily armored vehicles. “There are some visible bullet holes in the fire truck, and the damage to the fire truck and UN vehicle looks more consistent with heavy vehicles,” he added.
An IDF forward-operating base and staging area at an unfinished hospital in Tal al-Sultan, about 1 kilometer from the site of the mass grave, is visible in satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Ball said tracks from heavy vehicles can be seen between the base and grave site, adding that the military would have had a clear line of sight to where the bodies and vehicles were buried.
The IDF claimed on April 1 without offering proof that “following an initial assessment, it was determined that the forces had eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who took part in the October 7 massacre, along with 8 other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.”
In a statement on Monday, the IDF revised that number, saying six Hamas operatives were identified among the casualties, without providing evidence.
But the aid agencies said the name given by the Israeli military did not match that of any emergency workers dispatched, and no Hamas militants were among the group. CNN obtained from the PRCS the names of 14 of those killed; none was identified as Mohammad Shubaki. A spokesperson with the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said the name of the 15th man killed – an UNRWA employee – was not shared out of respect for his family but was not the name given by the Israeli military.
Abed told CNN he does not know anybody by the name Shubaki, nor had he heard it before.
The mass grave
Over the course of the next several days, PRCS and UN personnel negotiated permission from the Israeli military to visit the area on several occasions. It would be a week later that a convoy consisting of PRCS, Civil Defense, and UN OCHA crews unearthed the mass grave.
The operation recovered a total of 15 bodies: eight members of PRCS, six from Civil Defense, and one UNRWA employee. Photos and videos of the excavation reviewed by CNN and forensic experts offer clues as to the crews’ visibility as first responders in their final moments.
One PRCS medic from the convoy, Asaad Al-Nassasrah, remains missing and the organization has demanded information about his whereabouts from the Israeli military. CNN has also asked the IDF for more information about the missing medic.
Some of the PRCS paramedics pictured in photos were buried in their uniforms emblazoned with the group’s emblem and reflective stripes. Others were still wearing their blue latex gloves, indicating that they were on duty and prepared to respond to distress calls. The bodies were mixed with mangled fragments of the crushed emergency vehicles, under mounds of sand, footage shared by UN OCHA of the exhumation shows.
“They were buried in their uniforms with their gloves on, they were ready to save lives, and they ended up in a mass grave,” Jonathan Whittall, the head of UN OCHA in the occupied Palestinian territories, said in a press briefing last week.
A forensic pathologist examining the bodies of the emergency responders told CNN that their autopsies had shown bullet wounds.
The deaths have sparked international condemnation, and the emergence of the footage prompted the IDF to re-investigate the killings.
The findings of the IDF’s preliminary investigation included information from Israeli aerial surveillance video that has not been made public, an Israeli military official told CNN on Saturday.
According to the military official, troops from the Golani infantry brigade had set up an ambush along a road in the early hours of March 23, opening fire in two instances on vehicles arriving in the area.
Soldiers were told by drone operators that the vehicles in the convoy were advancing “in a suspicious manner,” the military official said, adding that soldiers involved in the attack claimed to investigators that they opened fire after being surprised by the convoy stopping on the side of the road and by individuals getting out of their vehicles quickly.
After seeing the bodies of more than a dozen uniformed emergency responders on the ground, the troops said they still believed they had successfully carried out the attack following efforts to verify the identities of some of the deceased, the military official said.
PRCS president Al-Khatib has demanded an independent investigation into the matter.
“We don’t trust any of the army investigations and this is why we were very clear in saying that we need an independent inquiry into this,” Al-Khatib said in a UN press conference.
First responders under attack
For Saleh Muammar – one of the PRCS paramedics killed and buried in the mass grave – this was not the first time he had been shot while on duty, according to his wife Hadeel.
Two months earlier, Saleh was shot in the chest by the IDF, Hadeel told CNN in an interview. She said that he survived the attack, getting “a new lease on life” and returned to work as a paramedic.
“We bade him farewell every time he left, we expected that he would be martyred,” Hadeel said. “I felt that he would leave this world because the nature of his work is full of risks.”
International aid and humanitarian organizations have repeatedly condemned the Israeli military’s attacks on medical facilities and personnel.
More than 400 aid workers have been killed in Israeli attacks in the enclave since October 7, 2023, according to OCHA’s latest update released last week. The PRCS says the number of its staff killed in line of duty by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 2023 has now reached 27.
“The occupation’s targeting of Red Crescent medics … can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world,” PCRS said.","['Yahya Abou-Ghazala', 'Kareem Khadder', 'Jeremy Diamond', 'Abeer Salman', 'Gianluca Mezzofiore']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/middleeast/israel-gaza-blockade-aid-agencies-intl/index.html,Israel-Hamas war: Aid agencies sound the alarm as Gaza blockade enters a second month,2025-04-03 00:00:00,"One month after Israel cut off humanitarian aid from the Gaza Strip, aid agencies say the humanitarian situation there has deteriorated dangerously, with the plight of two million civilians worsened by intensive Israeli military operations.
The United Nations and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza who have spoken with CNN, say hunger is spreading, there is less access to clean water, and fleas infest makeshift displacement camps.
The problems that have plagued the territory’s population for the last 18 months have been accentuated by the renewed assault launched by the Israeli military in March, which has included several evacuation orders.
The Israeli government shut down the supply of food and other humanitarian aid into Gaza ahead of the offensive, in a bid to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and impose new conditions on the extension of the ceasefire. Israel has also said Hamas intercepts and diverts shipments of humanitarian aid into Gaza, a charge the US confirmed last May.
The Israeli military’s renewed assault in Gaza has displaced almost 400,000 Palestinians, according to the UN. At least 1,391 Palestinians, including 505 children, have been killed since March 18, Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported on Monday. It was the highest one-week death toll among children in Gaza in the past year, according to the UN.
Assem Al-Nabeeh, a spokesperson for the Gaza City municipality, told CNN that after several recent evacuation orders “people are literally being displaced everywhere, on main roads, in public parks, near garbage dumps, in squares, and even in buildings that are on the verge of collapse.”
“Even before the latest evacuation orders, only 40% of the city had access to water,” Al-Nabeeh said. He estimated that 175,000 tonnes of waste had accumulated across the city.
The senior OCHA official for Palestinian territories, Jonathan Whittall, said earlier this week that a “war without limits” was underway in Gaza. In a report released Friday, OCHA said: “Gaza faces renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition as the full cargo blockade, now entering the second month, almost halts all flour distribution and shuts all subsidized bakeries.”
The World Food Programme (WFP) said on Thursday that all 25 subsidized bakeries across Gaza had closed because of a lack of cooking gas and flour. It added that more than one million people were left without food parcels in March, and while the supply of hot meals was continuing, current “supplies will last two weeks maximum.”
The Israeli agency in charge of coordinating aid deliveries into Gaza says there must be “ a structured monitoring and aid entry mechanism” to prevent Hamas from seizing humanitarian supplies and to assure organizations’ operations stay “neutral and impartial.”
The agency – COGAT – said a new mechanism it is preparing would “support aid organizations, enhance oversight and accountability, and ensure that assistance reaches the civilian population in need, rather than being diverted and stolen by Hamas.”
The mechanism has been presented to international aid organizations, according to an official in COGAT, but its use is contingent upon a ceasefire deal or a change in government directive.
In the meantime, huge amounts of aid sit outside Gaza.
WFP says that some 89,000 tonnes of food waits outside Gaza, while food scarcity inside is driving up prices dramatically. A bag of wheat flour costs 450% more than it did a few weeks ago.
Meanwhile, OCHA says access to water remains “severely constrained” – with two-thirds of Gazan households unable to access six liters (around 200 fluid ounces) of drinking water per day. After an improvement in water production and supply during the recent ceasefire, agencies are now struggling to repair and maintain infrastructure.
That’s also affecting sanitation in areas increasingly crowded with displaced people. “Sanitation conditions across the Gaza Strip remain alarming,” OCHA said, with makeshift displacement sites on the coast infested with fleas and mites.
‘Massacre of Palestinians’
The Biden administration repeatedly pressured the Israeli government to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including pausing a shipment of bombs over concern about the civilian population in the coastal enclave. But that pressure has all but vanished under the Trump administration.
Gavin Kelleher of the Norwegian Refugee Council said at the end of March that “more than a million people remain in dire need of tents in Gaza” but his organization had “almost nothing left to distribute despite still seeing these massive forced transfers happening every day.”
“Many people, with no alternative shelter, are staying in structurally unsound and damaged buildings, where incidents of buildings collapsing on top of men, women and children continue to be recorded,” Kelleher added.
In recent weeks, an average of 100 children have been killed or maimed daily in Gaza, according to the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF. The agency’s executive director, Catherine Russell, said the strip’s children had “again been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation.”
UNICEF says it and other agencies “have been unable to provide clothing and other essential items even to the most vulnerable of displaced children who only have the clothes they are wearing.”
On Monday, a group of independent UN experts warned that Israel’s actions in Gaza were “leading to a massacre of Palestinians.”
“We are witnessing the destruction of Palestinian life,” the experts said in a statement. “If they are not killed by bombs or bullets, they slowly suffocate for lack of basic means of survival. The only difference is the means and speed of death.”
As casualties have risen since the ceasefire ended, the World Health Organization also reported that Gaza’s hospitals are overwhelmed with patients. It said Al-Shifa Hospital in the north of the territory was dealing with 400 people daily, nearly triple its average of 140 before hostilities resumed on 18 March.
Dr. Fadel Naeem, director of the Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, told CNN his facility was overwhelmed by the number of bodies and injured people arriving. On April 3 alone, he said, 128 injured individuals had arrived “and the hospital simply lacks the capacity to handle this volume due to the ongoing blockade on the health sector.”
Naeem said the hospital had been forced to “prioritize,” by, for example, performing surgeries only for those who were more likely to survive. “Tragically, while waiting for care, some of the wounded died due to a lack of resources, operating rooms, and medical staff,” Naeem added.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Relief and Works Agency, which leads UN efforts in Palestinian territories, said “People are starving, chaos & looting have returned… People are exhausted as they continue to be locked up in a tiny piece of land.”",[],en

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Global markets
President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war continued to cause turmoil today across world financial markets. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower and the Shanghai Composite Index ended down more than 7%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index tumbled nearly 12% while South Korea’s Kospi finished 5.6% lower. In Europe, Germany’s Dax opened down 9% and London’s FTSE was off about 5%. The picture is just as grim on Wall Street where stocks are set to open sharply lower, putting the S&P 500 on the precipice of a bear market — a decline of 20% from its peak and an ominous sign for investors and perhaps the broader economy.
2. Israel
It’s been a month since Israel cut off humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip and without that much-needed aid, the living situation of 2 million civilians has rapidly deteriorated. In the past few weeks, Israel’s renewed bombing campaign has claimed hundreds of lives and displaced more than 280,000 people, according to UN officials. Without access to food, fuel and clean water, hunger in Gaza is worsening and could lead to famine. A lack of basic infrastructure and sanitation could also spark outbreaks of disease. The UN and other aid groups have accused Israel of violating international law by blocking the flow of aid into Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war. On Sunday, Israel announced that it would continue to withhold aid to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and would impose new conditions on the extension of the ceasefire agreement.
3. Flooding
Violent storms that swept through the central US have claimed the lives of at least 19 people in seven states since Wednesday. In addition to strong winds, hail and tornadoes, the severe weather system dropped potentially record rainfall in areas unaccustomed to flooding. Rising river levels have prompted Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear to declare a state of emergency. Numerous water rescues took place in the Colesburg area some 30 miles south of Louisville as the Rolling Fork River rose rapidly on Sunday. Drone footage from nearby towns showed streets, fields, homes and businesses under vast quantities of water. Evacuations and warnings have also been issued near the Kentucky River, which is expected to crest at a historic high later today.
4. Deportations
The Trump administration has until 11:59 p.m. today to return a Maryland man who was deported to El Salvador in March. A federal judge issued the order Friday after the administration conceded in a court filing that it had mistakenly deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. He is currently being held in a notorious mega-prison. Abrego Garcia had been living in the states under protected status since 2019 after fleeing gang violence in El Salvador. In its filing, the Trump administration admitted that ICE was aware of Abrego Garcia’s protected status and that his deportation was due to “an administrative error.” Now the White House claims it can’t get him back and is appealing the judge’s ruling.
5. Sea lions
Sea lions have been washing up dead or sick on Southern California’s coastline due to contact with a toxic algal bloom, often referred to as red tide. Although the toxin is naturally present in the Pacific Ocean, human-caused climate change, upwelling and land development has been feeding the outsized blooms. When the neurological toxin gets in the sea lions’ food supply, it causes them to suffer from domoic acid toxicosis, a condition that causes seizures, difficulty breathing and aggressive or scared behavior. The illness has already led the poisoned animals to attack several humans in the water. “When they are affected with this toxin, they’re out of their minds,” John Warner, CEO of the Marine Mammal Care Center in Los Angeles, said. The center normally receives 3,000 to 4,000 calls per year about sick and stranded animals, but in the past five weeks, their hotline has received more than 2,000 calls. Dolphins have also been affected, causing dozens to strand themselves on beaches. Unlike sea lions, which can be rehabilitated, dolphins suffering from domoic acid poisoning are usually deceased when they strand, but the few still alive have to be euthanized.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/05/middleeast/gaza-aid-workers-video-israel-intl/index.html,Video showing final moments of Gaza emergency workers casts doubt on Israeli account of killings,2025-04-05 14:53:11,"A video has emerged showing the final moments of more than a dozen Palestinian emergency workers shot dead by Israeli troops in Gaza last month, casting doubt on Israeli claims that soldiers opened fire on vehicles “advancing suspiciously.”
The video is filmed from the front of a vehicle and shows a convoy of clearly marked ambulances moving along a road at dawn, with headlights and flashing emergency lights on.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says the video was found on the phone of one of the 15 ambulance and relief team members killed by the Israeli military.
Their bodies were found in a mass grave more than a week after they were reported as missing. Eight of the 14 bodies recovered from the site in the southern Rafah area were identified as members of the PRCS, five as civil defense, and one as a UN agency employee, PRCS said in a statement.
The deaths sparked international condemnation, and the footage appears to contradict the assertion by the Israeli military that some vehicles were moving suspiciously without lights.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) asserted last week that “several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals. IDF troops then opened fire at the suspected vehicles.”
After the video emerged, the IDF repeated that the incident was being investigated – the first results of which were presented internally on Sunday.
“All claims, including the documentation circulating about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation,” it said Saturday.
The video shows the convoy stopping when it comes across another vehicle at the side of the road – which the PRCS says was an ambulance that had been sent earlier to help injured civilians. Two of the rescuers who get out of the vehicles are wearing uniforms. A fire truck and an ambulance at the scene are marked with the PRCS insignia.
Almost immediately there is intense gunfire, which can be heard hitting the convoy. The video ends, but the audio continues for five minutes.
The paramedic filming, identified by the PRCS as Rifaat Radwan, is heard repeatedly saying the “shahada,” which Muslims recite when facing death. He asks God for forgiveness and says he knows he is going to die.
At one point he says: “Forgive me mom, this is the path I chose – to help people – I swear I didn’t choose this path but to help people.”
The voices of others in the convoy can also be heard, as well as those of people shouting commands in Hebrew. It’s not clear who they are or what they are saying.
Initial investigation findings
The IDF said the findings of the investigation were presented to Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir on Sunday.
The investigation includes information from Israeli aerial surveillance video that has not been made public, an Israeli military official told CNN previously.
Asor began re-investigating the incident after footage emerged contradicting IDF soldiers’ description of the vehicles as moving with their lights off, the Israeli military official said. That information came directly from IDF soldiers involved in the attack, who initially testified that the ambulances had their lights off, the official said.
According to the military official, troops from the Golani infantry brigade had set up an ambush along a road in the early hours of March 23. Around 4:30 a.m., they opened fire on a first vehicle, killing two individuals and detaining another who the IDF claims were Hamas internal security officials. Roughly two hours later, at approximately 6 a.m., the ambulance convoy arrived in the area.
Soldiers were told by drone operators that the vehicles were advancing “in a suspicious manner,” the military official said, adding that soldiers involved in the attack claimed to investigators that they opened fire after being surprised by the convoy stopping on the side of the road and by individuals getting out of their vehicles quickly.
After seeing the bodies of more than a dozen uniformed emergency responders on the ground, the troops said they still believed they had successfully carried out the attack following efforts to verify the identities of some of the deceased, the military official said.
The Israeli military has yet to provide any evidence for its claim that nine of the emergency workers killed were militants.
The IDF said on April 1 that “following an initial assessment, it was determined that the forces had eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who took part in the October 7 massacre, along with eight other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.” The IDF did not offer proof of the identity of the alleged terrorists.
CNN has obtained from the PRCS the names of 14 of those killed; none is identified as Mohammad Shubaki. The PRCS said the name of the fifteenth man killed – an UNRWA employee – was withheld out of respect for his family but was not the name given by the Israeli military.
An Israeli military official told CNN last week that Israeli forces buried the bodies of the workers because they expected it would take time to coordinate their retrieval with the PRCS and the United Nations. Israeli officials have not explained why their emergency vehicles were also buried, citing the ongoing investigation.
Satellite imagery from March 23, first published by Al Jazeera Arabic and analyzed by CNN, shows Israeli army vehicles surrounding a cluster of five ambulances from the PRCS and Civil Defense.
Another satellite image, also published by Al Jazeera and analyzed by CNN, dated March 25, shows an Israeli tank, an excavator, and other military vehicles at the same location.
Where the ambulances once stood, remnants of vehicles protruded from disturbed ground.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-gaza-dividing-morag-intl/index.html,Netanyahu says Israel is now dividing up Gaza. What does that mean on the ground?,2025-04-03 12:32:58,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that the country’s forces would be “switching gears” in Gaza, dividing and seizing more parts of the strip, moves experts say point to deeper, long-term Israeli control over the territory.
Israel says it will escalate its campaign against Hamas in Gaza until it agrees to revised ceasefire terms, with the defense minister vowing to seize “large areas” of the enclave.
On Friday, the Israel Defense Force said troops had moved into an area of northern Gaza, taking control of more territory days after the government announced plans to seize areas of the south.
While there are no signs of a major boost in Israeli presence on the ground, Gaza has seen an intense bombing campaign, with the territory’s health ministry saying on Friday at least 86 people have been killed in the space of 24 hours, bringing the total number of the dead to 1,249 since Israel renewed its military operations in the strip on March 18.
Gaza’s Civil Defense said 25 people – all but one belonging to the same family – died in a strike on a house in Khan Younis early Friday. CNN has approached the Israeli military for comment.
It remains unclear how much land Israel is prepared to seize or whether permanent annexation is being considered, however Netanyahu gave some hints, in particular saying his troops would wrest control over another key strip of land.
“Last night in the Gaza Strip, we switched gears. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is seizing territory, striking the terrorists and destroying the infrastructure,” Netanyahu said in a video speech on Wednesday.
“We are now dividing the strip and increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages. And as long as they do not give them to us, the pressure will increase until they do.”
“We are also doing something else: We are seizing the Morag Corridor. This will be the second Philadelphi, an additional Philadelphi Corridor,” he added.
The Morag Corridor refers to the settlement of Morag that once lay between the cities of Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza. The Philadelphi corridor is a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt, which Israel had also seized and continues to occupy as a major sticking point in ceasefire negotiations.
A historic route linking Gaza’s Sufa crossing to the former settlement of Morag, the Morag Corridor could become a dividing line between Khan Younis and Rafah if seized by Israeli forces, experts told CNN on Wednesday.
Gisha, an Israeli human rights organization that focuses on the freedom of movement of Palestinians, says that even before the current operation, Israel had already expanded its control of a buffer zone along the edges of the enclave, covering almost 52 square kilometers along the entire perimeter of the Strip, or 17% of its total area.
Col.(res) Grisha Yakubovich, former Head of the Civil Department for the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) compared the move – which also follows a number of evacuation orders for Palestinians – to Israeli forces’ earlier creation of a “buffer zone” in northern Gaza, where troops cleared Hamas strongholds and established a security perimeter near Israeli border communities.
In the south, he told CNN that the IDF may seek to evacuate Rafah’s population and extend a southern buffer zone. Holding these border zones puts pressure on Hamas while protecting Israeli communities, Yakubovich said.
‘Closed control’
Maj. Gen. (res.) Eitan Dangot, former Coordinator of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT), speculated that seizing the Morag corridor could be the start of dividing Gaza into three broad sections for greater control.
“It means Israel or the IDF is going through a very clear process in order to keep areas under closed control by military forces that prevent movement from area to area,” he said.
“There will be full control of traffic that will be allowed to enter and to cross. That means if the time comes that Israel will allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, the control of the convoys will be under more close control,” Dangot added.
Focusing on the Morag corridor is also “a kind of a political decision in order to give the right-wing extremists in the government, a kind of hope that maybe we will be back in some areas (settlements) as before,” Dangot added. “When you say ‘Morag’ out loud, it means going back to the disengagement of Gush Katif.”
Gush Katif was a bloc of several Israeli settlements, including the agricultural settlement of Morag, in the southern Gaza Strip. When Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dismantled Gush Katif and expelled some 8,000 Jewish residents living there.
Some Israeli settlers have since October 7 called for a return to Gush Katif and for the re-settlement of Gaza, a movement emboldened by Israel’s right-wing politicians who have openly called for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza.
Gaza’s fragile ceasefire was shattered on March 18 as Israel carried out deadly strikes across the enclave and Netanyahu vowed to use “increasing military strength” against Hamas until all hostages are released.
Hostage talks have stalled, with Hamas rejecting Israel’s latest proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza which would have seen a 40-day truce in exchange for the release of 11 hostages, itself a counterproposal to an Egyptian offer Hamas agreed.
A total of 24 living hostages are believed to be in Gaza and the bodies of 35 deceased hostages are thought to still be held in the enclave.
After the first phase of the deal ended in early March, Israel said it would block all aid going into Gaza until Hamas accepted a new, US-backed extension of the ceasefire. Hamas – which wants to see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza - rejected the plan, accusing Israel of reneging over commitments made during initial talks over the truce.
Israel resumed full-scale military operations soon after – and mediators are struggling to revive negotiations.
Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza on October 7, 2023, following the militant group’s surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
The war has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza since October 7, 2023, according to the territory’s health ministry. Authorities in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters when reporting casualty figures, but the health ministry and the United Nations say the majority of deaths are women and children
Among the living, desperation is growing as hunger reaches critical levels under Israel’s weeks-long humanitarian blockade of the enclave. On Wednesday, a large crowd forcibly broke into a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) warehouse in Gaza’s Al-Tuffah neighborhood, looting bags of flour meant for humanitarian distribution.
“Hunger and desperation are spreading as food and relief assistance are being weaponized,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X on Thursday.","['Lauren Izso', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Pauline Lockwood']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/world/netanyahu-travels-to-hungary-intl/index.html,"Netanyahu jets to Orbán’s Hungary, a safe haven from his international arrest warrant",2025-02-07 00:00:00,"Once upon a time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strode the world with great confidence. His message for audiences back home, after another successful trip to Africa or Asia, would focus on how his hosts wanted Israel’s technology and admired its security.
It is very different these days.
Since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest in November over allegations of possible war crimes in Gaza, Netanyahu hasn’t visited a country under the court’s jurisdiction. That is, until Wednesday, when he landed in Budapest for a four-day visit.
“Welcome to Budapest, Israel PM, Benjamin Netanyahu!” Hungary’s defense minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky wrote in a post on Facebook alongside photos of the pair meeting at the airport.
The Hungarian capital is safe ground for the Israeli leader and home to one of his biggest international pals, Viktor Orbán.
Hungary’s premier was among the first to condemn the ICC announcement, in which the court said it had “reasonable grounds” to believe Netanyahu bore criminal responsibility for war crimes including “starvation as a method of warfare.”
“Brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable,” Orbán countered, adding that his friend’s freedom would be guaranteed when he next wished to visit.
Should it indeed fail to enforce the ICC decision, Hungary will be in breach of its obligations under the Rome Statute, which established the court in 2002. But it seems clear Netanyahu is not concerned he may be met by police when he lands at Budapest’s Ferenc Liszt airport.
And he is not a man given to taking chances. When he flew to the United States in February, his plane flew a longer route than necessary, passing close to a series of US air bases in Europe. The 75-year-old has had health issues and there were concerns over whether some countries would be safe if his plane were forced to make an emergency landing. The US – like Israel and several other countries such as Russia and China – has not signed up to the court.
The Budapest visit is expected to see the Israeli leader tour the city’s Holocaust Museum, in addition to various political meetings. But the schedule is also noticeably empty toward the backend of the trip. And while this coincides with Shabbat – which Netanyahu is seen as observing for pragmatic, if not religious, reasons – some in Israel have expressed surprise the prime minister has not opted to return home on Friday before it begins, especially given the Israeli army’s renewed offensive inside Gaza.
Given the restrictions on his travel options, it may be that the Israeli leader has other meetings planned with foreign emissaries during his time in Budapest. For sure, as a safe third country, Hungary offers a now-rare opportunity for Netanyahu to pursue more sensitive initiatives face-to-face.
Whatever his diary might look like, the trip is a golden opportunity for Netanyahu to make a point about the ICC and show that he can still function as a normal prime minister, Yair Zivan, long-time foreign policy aide to Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, and editor of a book “The Centre Must Hold,” told CNN.
Zivan, in common with the overwhelming majority of Israelis, regardless of what they think of Netanyahu, is highly critical of the arrest warrant, arguing that it serves as a reward for Hamas terrorism. But he articulates the dilemma felt by many of his countrymen and women when they see Israel’s leader in the happy embrace of autocracy.
“We obviously appreciate the support that we get, especially when too many people have turned their backs on us in the last 18 months. But the decision to align yourself with a values-based relationship, with people who are, like Netanyahu, trying to undermine liberal democracy, trying to undermine the basic checks and balances that allow democracy to function, is a deeply troubling one for us and for the world,” he said.
Netanyahu and Orbán have been pursuing attacks on their respective countries’ judiciary and media for many years. In Israel, popular protests against the country’s most right-wing government ever have stepped up again, given new impetus by growing opposition to a resumption of the war in Gaza at the expense of securing the release of the remaining hostages held in the territory.
In Hungary, too, there is a burgeoning sense that Orbán, for the first time in more than a decade, is facing a serious challenge to his rule. Elections are not due for a year, but the opposition, in Péter Magyar, appears to have found a leader able to tap into popular discontent on issues like falling standards in schools and hospitals.
So, for Orbán, as well, the visit of Netanyahu offers the chance to get back to basics and exploit a certain inferiority complex among Hungarians, Márton Gergely, editor of independent news weekly HVG, told CNN.
“Orbán is serving the country’s national pride by showing that he is bigger than the stage Hungary by itself grants him. To do that, he actively looks for provocative possibilities, like inviting Xi Jinping to Budapest, and meeting with Vladimir Putin despite the war in Ukraine,” he says. Thumbing his nose at the ICC by welcoming Netanyahu is an opportunity too good to miss.
The visit, then, offers the two men something of a respite from the challenges both see as paramount. Namely, holding on to power. And while the interests of international law look unlikely to be served over the next four days, the trip, by virtue of its singularity, acts as a reminder of the new international constraints under which Israel’s leader now operates.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/middleeast/israel-expands-military-operations-gaza-intl-hnk/index.html,"Israel announces expansion of military operation in Gaza to seize ‘large areas’ of land, ordering residents to leave",2025-04-02 04:27:18,"Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced Wednesday a major expansion of the military’s operation in Gaza involving the seizure of large areas of land that would be “incorporated into Israel’s security zones.”
In the statement, Katz said the operation would also involve a “large-scale evacuation of Gaza’s population from combat zones,” without specifying details.
Signs of the operation’s expansion are yet to be seen on the ground, although the enclave saw heavy airstrikes that have so far killed dozens people in the last 24 hours, according to local authorities, including at least nine children when a UN shelter was hit.
According to the defense minister’s statement, the military operation would expand to “crush and clear the area of terrorists and terror infrastructure, while seizing large areas that will be incorporated into Israel’s security zone.”
The Israeli military’s spokesperson for Arabic media late on Tuesday ordered residents in Gaza’s southern Rafah area to leave their homes and move north.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also announced a military escalation in Gaza in a video speech on Wednesday and vowed to increase pressure on the strip until all hostages held there are released.
“We are also doing something else: We are seizing the Morag Corridor. This will be the second Philadelphi, an additional Philadelphi Corridor,” he added.
The Morag Corridor refers to the settlement of Morag that once lay between Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza. The Philadelphi corridor is a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt.
“Because we are now dividing the strip and increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages. And as long as they do not give them to us, the pressure will increase until they do,” Netanyahu said.
There are 59 Israeli hostages held in Gaza, 24 believed to be alive, 35 believed to be dead.
Last month, an Israeli official and a second source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel was making plans for a potential major ground offensive in Gaza that would involve sending tens of thousands of troops into combat to clear and occupy large swaths of the enclave.
Katz’s statement on Wednesday did not specify whether additional Israeli troops would be involved in the expanded operation.
The announcement comes as Israel continued its aerial bombardment on the strip. At least 17 people were killed in Israeli strikes overnight in southern Gaza, local hospitals said.
Among those killed, at least 13 people - including women and children - had been sheltering in a residential house after being displaced from the Rafah area, according to Nasser Hospital. Two others were killed in a separate strike in central Gaza, according to Al Awda Hospital, which received their bodies.
Also on Wednesday, Gaza’s Civil Defense said that 19 bodies, including those of nine children, were recovered following an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA clinic that acted as a shelter for displaced people in Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza.
The IDF said it had “attacked terrorists from the Hamas terrorist organization” there, adding that “prior to the attack, many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians.” The IDF did not say whether the site it attacked was an UNRWA shelter but the UN said one of its facilities was hit.
Katz’s announcement also comes after thousands of Palestinians last week protested against Hamas and Israel’s war in Gaza. Buoyed by the protests, the defense minister called on Gazans to take to the streets, saying Hamas is “endangering” the lives of Palestinians in the enclave.
He said that the Israeli military would soon be operating “forcefully in additional areas in Gaza,” and urged Palestinians to remove Hamas from power and release all Israeli hostages.
“This is the only way to stop the war,” he said.
Israel resumed its offensive on Gaza two weeks ago, shattering a two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas, weeks after it imposed a complete blockade of humanitarian aid entering the enclave. It warned that its forces would maintain a permanent presence in parts of Gaza until the release of the remaining 24 hostages who are believed to still be alive.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the enclave since then and the UN has warned that food supplies are running out.
Local authorities and the United Nations have said that all bakeries in Gaza have closed due to a severe lack of fuel and flour. The closures are likely to accelerate the spread of famine in the strip, the head of the local Bakery Owners’ Association, Abdel Nasser Al-Ajrami told the Palestinian Press Agency Safa.
Gaza’s fragile ceasefire was shattered on March 18 as Israel carried out deadly strikes across the enclave and Netanyahu vowed to use “increasing military strength” against Hamas.
Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza on October 7, 2023, following the militant group’s surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s war with Hamas began, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Hostage families are ‘horrified’
The Israeli military, led by its new and more aggressive chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, has been crafting plans for a large-scale operation in Gaza for weeks now. Such a decision could see the Israeli military occupying the territory and fighting insurgencies for years.
But a longer-term offensive in Gaza could also draw stiff resistance from the Israeli public, a majority of which has been clamoring for a hostage release deal instead of a return to war.
The families’ forum of the Israeli hostages on Wednesday said they were “horrified to wake up” to the news of the military operation being expanded.
“Instead of securing the release of the hostages through an agreement and ending the war, the Israeli government is sending more soldiers into Gaza to fight in the same places they have fought time and again,” the forum said in a statement.
Egypt and Qatar have intensified efforts to revive the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in recent days – with the militant group agreeing to a new Egyptian proposal on Sunday, and Israel responding with a counter-proposal on Monday.
Egypt’s proposal would see Hamas release five hostages, including the American-Israeli Edan Alexander, in exchange for a renewed ceasefire, a Hamas source told CNN. It’s similar to the proposal presented several weeks ago by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, although it is not clear whether it also includes the release of additional bodies of deceased hostages.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/us/israel-protesters-us-students-deport/index.html,"A pro-Israel group says it gave US list of protesters to deport, drawing alarm from students’ supporters",2025-03-10 00:00:00,"Not long after the October 2023 Hamas attacks in Israel and subsequent war in Gaza, Ross Glick’s inbox flooded with tips, photos, video and information about students and faculty members participating in pro-Palestinian protests on US college campuses.
As many protesters rallied against Israel’s military response and demanded a ceasefire, Glick – a pro-Israel activist – focused on the emails and would temporarily join New York-based Betar USA, a self-described Zionist advocacy group with a motto of “Jews fight back.” The tips would become part of Betar’s effort to compile information and expose certain protesters that Glick claims wanted not just to support Palestinians but also to incite violence and hatred toward Jews.
Now, as the Trump administration has begun arresting and trying to deport several noncitizen students and academics – some of whom were pro-Palestinian protesters – Betar says it’s been telling the administration whom to look for.
Betar says it shared with the government a list of noncitizen protesters and activists it believes should be deported. It says the effort is in response to President Donald Trump’s January executive order, which promised to “combat antisemitism” on college campuses. An accompanying administration fact sheet said the government could seek to deport noncitizen “Hamas sympathizers,” participants of “pro-jihadist protests” and people accused of antisemitic acts.
“Our research, our information, the massive amount of video and photos that we have gathered – we create our dossiers and our reports. We hand them over, we make recommendations,” Glick, who left his executive director post at Betar about a month ago after helping establish its research operation, told CNN in a recent interview.
Betar – which the Jewish civil rights group Anti-Defamation League put on a list of groups that it says promote extremist or hateful ideologies, an action Betar calls a baseless smear campaign – has been open about flagging noncitizen protesters for possible deportation.
“We submitted the names of hundreds of protesters and activists to the Trump administration/DHS urging ICE to deport them under the executive orders,” Daniel Levy, a spokesperson for Betar, told CNN in March.
Besides claiming to give this information to the government, Betar – and other pro-Jewish groups – have posted online the names, pictures and other information of noncitizen pro-Palestinian protesters who they allege expressed Hamas support or Jewish hate.
Whether the government is using that information is unclear. Meanwhile, the tactics of Betar and other groups, including Canary Mission, have drawn various concerns.
Supporters of recently detained academics decry the groups’ efforts as inappropriate harassment and a disinformation campaign. Privacy experts with whom CNN spoke say the documentation exposes tensions between the chilling of free speech and minimal expectations of privacy in public places, and it raises concerns about the extent to which a government should use information distributed by outside groups. And a student profiled by one of the groups – while not among the detained – says the profile inaccurately describes her and caused her to endure death threats, anxiety and depression.
A number of academics detained this year to await deportation proceedings were profiled online by at least one of these groups, including Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure in last year’s protests at Columbia University, and Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University doctoral student taken away by immigration officers outside her Massachusetts apartment last week. Neither has been criminally charged, and their supporters have argued they’ve been falsely portrayed and that the administration has no basis for deporting them.
The State Department declined to answer CNN’s question about whether it has used information from Betar or any similar group. Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week said: “We’re not going to talk about the process by which we’re identifying” deportation targets “because obviously we’re looking for more people.”
A State Department spokesperson told CNN the agency uses “all available technology” in visa screenings and vetting. “No matter how information comes to our attention, every visa decision is made by trained consular staff who review the information to ascertain whether a visa revocation is supported by the facts and law,” the spokesperson said.
The White House press secretary has said the Department of Homeland Security used “intelligence” to identify international student protesters who it thinks might have engaged in deportable offenses, but did not offer details.
“US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is not working with or received any tips through the ICE Tip Line from the groups identified as Betar and Canary Mission,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN.
What the groups say they do
According to Glick, when tipsters have flagged unidentified students and faculty, Betar has used facial recognition technology, artificial intelligence and open-source information such as social media postings and media appearances to help put names to the subjects.
“Once it became known through our circles that we were undertaking this process, and before I even got involved with Betar, I had people contacting me from all over the country,” said Glick, who said he left his Betar role to pursue other projects.
Glick’s X profile boasts photos and videos of a recent visit to Capitol Hill, and videos in which he appears to confront people at pro-Palestinian rallies. Even after leaving Betar, he wants to expose what he describes as an “organized effort” against the Jewish community, he says.
Betar also recently took credit for a pair of incendiary stickers that appeared on a pole on Harvard Law School’s campus last week. The school sent a letter to students condemning the stickers, saying they were “posted in violation of campus policies.”
One of the stickers read, “Don’t be Mahmood Khalil. Be a racist if you want, just keep it to yourself #JFB (Jews fight back),” according to a Harvard University employee familiar with the incident. A different sticker read, “I am a green card holder who loves America. I will never be deported. Are You?” the Harvard Crimson reported.
Glick and Betar are not alone.
The anonymously run Canary Mission website says it “documents individuals and organizations that promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews on North American campuses and beyond.” It also says it will profile people who support efforts to boycott, divest from or sanction Israel or companies associating with Israel – which were among the demands of some campus pro-Palestinian protests last school year.
The site, which says it gathers content from publicly available sources and invites tips, contains purported bios of students and others. Bio pages have subjects’ photos, social media posts, media appearances and writings.
A Canary Mission spokesperson told CNN by email the group is apolitical and does not have any contact with the Trump administration. The group said its research is posted publicly for anyone to see following what it describes as careful vetting and fact checking, and did not respond to a question about who operates Canary Mission.
“When people view the profiles on our site, we hope they understand that hateful actions and words do carry consequences,” the Canary Mission spokesperson told CNN. “We believe sunlight is the best disinfectant, and by highlighting these behaviors, we encourage accountability and raise awareness of the widespread impact that antisemitic and hateful speech can have — both within and beyond campus communities.”
‘Dehumanizing doxing campaign,’ lawyers say
Khalil, a legal permanent US resident, participated in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last year before finishing his work on a master’s degree there in December.
Khalil was arrested outside his New York apartment March 8 after the Trump administration alleged, without providing evidence, that Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas.” His attorneys have denied he has any ties to Hamas.
The Trump administration has argued, in part, Khalil is a threat to US security, citing a law that allows noncitizens to be deported if their presence has “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”
In a filing against this detention, Khalil’s lawyers noted Betar’s claim it had submitted to the government the names of hundreds of activists it wanted deported. His lawyers also highlighted a January 29 X post from Betar that said Khalil was “on our deport list.” His lawyers also asserted the post falsely accused him of making inflammatory statements against Zionists.
A day before he was arrested, Khalil emailed the university’s interim president to ask for legal support and other protections, his lawyers said in a court document. In the email, Khalil cited what his lawyers called a “dehumanizing doxing campaign against him,” according to the document.
“I haven’t been able to sleep, fearing that ICE or a dangerous individual might come to my home,” Khalil wrote, according to a court document.
After Khalil’s detention, more arrests came.
Ozturk, the Tufts doctoral student, was arrested March 24 near the Massachusetts school’s Somerville campus. A Turkish national on a student visa, she is accused of having “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” a DHS spokesperson said, without specifying those activities. Her lawyers say she is unfairly being punished for speaking out for Palestinian rights.
Canary Mission had profiled her, calling her a supporter of the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel. It links out to a March 2024 opinion piece that Ozturk co-wrote in the school’s newspaper in which she criticized Tufts’ response to a student government group’s call for the university to divest.
Ozturk’s brother issued a statement accusing Canary Mission of targeting Ozturk strictly for her political views. “Canary Mission terrorizes supporters of Palestine by equating the Palestinian issue with terrorism and encourages the restriction of basic rights and freedoms,” Asim Ozturk wrote.
Lawyers for other students detained or sought for deportation proceedings, including Momodou Taal and Yunseo Chung, also noted groups’ efforts to identify the students, court documents show.
Exposed and in fear
Sara Rasikh, a University of Toronto graduate student who was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to Canada in 2013, learned Canary Mission had published information about her. Then she began receiving harassing messages and death threats on social media.
The Canary Mission profile was created after she took a forward-facing role in pro-Palestinian protests on her college campus last year, acting as a spokesperson for an encampment on school grounds, Rasikh said.
“Many students avoid engaging in Palestine solidarity organizing out of fear for their future career, their immigration status, and that is no way for a society to be functioning,” Rasikh said.
“Doxing is not new – racialized movements have long faced surveillance, harassment, repression, all the different tactics, and Canary Mission is part of this legacy,” she said.
Rasikh’s Canary Mission profile shows screenshots of her social media activity, photos and video of her at protests, along with a biography describing her as a supporter of Hamas.
“I’ve never spoken to or about Hamas, but my headline says that I support Hamas, which isn’t true,” she said.
Rasikh said the online profile has resulted in harassment, impacted her mental health and professional prospects, and caused her to fear for her safety and suffer from anxiety and depression.
“They are creating these profiles and these personalities for us that are so distant from reality, taking what we’re saying and twisting it to serve their narrative to incite fear and harm and violence,” Rasikh said.
Privacy in the public square
Privacy experts say while the groups’ activities raise serious concerns that exposure could prevent people from demonstrating, their actions may be within legal limits because they rely on publicly available information.
Groups like Betar and Canary Mission take information that is available across a range of disparate sources –- including social media feeds, pictures, school affiliations, LinkedIn profiles and even home addresses.
But using publicly available information to compile a list of deportation targets – and sharing with government officials who may use it to direct law enforcement action solely on the basis of their political opinions – raises concerns that people’s right to free speech and privacy is being infringed upon, said Megan Iorio, senior counsel and amicus director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy group in Washington, DC.
“Even if people don’t like what they’re saying, they have the right to say it,” Iorio said.
“On top of that, what they’re doing is then labeling these people as antisemites,” Iorio said. “So, this label that carries with it a lot of weight that can have implications for their reputation, and now also their ability to either stay in the country or to avoid criminal penalties for just speaking is enormous.”
Defamation, if something incorrect is published, could be the clearest available cause of legal action because of the potential reputational harm caused to the person whose photo is published, Iorio said. Protesters also could pursue legal remedies if they can show they were harmed, such as through harassment or violence, Iorio said.
Sophia Cope, a senior staff attorney on the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s civil liberties team, says a main problem would be if the government is using the groups’ information to punish legally protected speech.
“People who go to protest should understand that they are exposing themselves to other people’s cell phone videos, to media that’s there,” Cope said.
But “if the government acts on information to punish the targets for what appears to be legal activity, that’s the real problem,” she said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/middleeast/aid-workers-found-gaza-mass-grave-intl-hnk/index.html,Bodies of missing aid workers found in Gaza ‘mass grave’ following Israeli attacks,2025-03-31 08:26:06,"The bodies of more than a dozen aid workers have been recovered in southern Gaza from what a United Nations agency described as a “mass grave,” a week after they went missing following attacks by Israeli forces.
Eight of the 14 bodies recovered Sunday from the site in the southern Rafah area were identified as members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), five as civil defense, and one as a UN agency employee, PRCS said in a statement. One PRCS medic remains missing.
The body of a fifteenth person, a civil defense worker, was recovered last Thursday from the site, after PRCS said they were initially denied access to the area. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military.
Last week, PRCS said nine of its emergency medical technicians had been missing since March 23 following an incident in which Israeli forces fired on ambulances and fire trucks in southern Rafah.
An Israeli military official told CNN Wednesday that its forces did bury the bodies of the aid workers because the troops expected it would take time to coordinate their retrieval with the PRCS and the United Nations.
In another statement on Wednesday, the Israeli military said it will investigate the deadly attack.
“The incident from March 23rd, 2025, in which IDF forces opened fire targeting terrorists advancing in ambulances, has been transferred to the General Staff’s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism for investigation,” an IDF spokesperson told CNN in a statement, adding that the military “places utmost importance on maintaining communication with international organizations operating in Gaza and engages with them regularly.”
A day earlier IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani insisted the IDF “did not randomly attack an ambulance” and claimed without evidence that nine “terrorists” had been killed.
Aid organizations and the UN have expressed outrage over the attacks, which the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent said were the “single most deadly” for IFRC workers in almost a decade.
“This massacre of our team is a tragedy not only for us at the Palestine Red Crescent Society, but also for humanitarian work and humanity,” PCRS said in its statement, calling the targeting of its medics “a war crime” punishable under international law.
The attacks come amid Israel’s renewed assault on the enclave and as its complete blockade of humanitarian aid nears the one-month mark.
Buried beneath the sand
OCHA, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said the bodies were recovered after a “complex, week-long rescue operation” that involved using bulldozers and heavy machinery to unearth the victims and their battered vehicles from under sand.
“Health workers should never be a target. And yet, we’re here today, digging up a mass grave of first responders and paramedics,” Jonathan Whittall, the head of UNOCHA in the occupied Palestinian territories, said from the site.
Video shared by the UNOCHA showed a bulldozer digging through dirt and moving debris as emergency responders used shovels to reach the victims. Several bodies were seen being pulled from sand, some wearing PRCS vests and showing signs of decomposition.
Early information indicates the first team of aid workers dispatched to the area were killed by Israeli forces on March 23 and other emergency aid crews were struck over the following several hours as they searched for their missing colleagues, UNOCHA said.
“One by one, they were hit, they were struck, their bodies were gathered and buried,” Whittall said. “We’re digging them out in their uniforms, with their gloves on.”
Ambulances, as well as UN and civil defense vehicles, were found crushed and buried under the sand, Whittall added, accusing Israeli forces of trying to cover up the scene.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
According to the PRCS, their aid workers were dispatched to Rafah’s Al-Hashashin area on March 23 to respond to Israeli attacks when they came under assault.
“Israeli forces besieged the area, leading to (the) complete loss of communication with our teams,” PRCS said.
Hours later, Gaza’s Civil Defense said that six of its staff also went missing after being dispatched to the same area following what it described as a “sudden incursion by the Israeli occupation forces, the killing and injuring of dozens, and the besieging” of PRCS vehicles.
The Israeli military told CNN earlier its forces had opened fire that day at “suspicious vehicles,” including ambulances and fire trucks, that were advancing toward troops without prior coordination, use of headlights or emergency signals.
It said it had “eliminated” a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants by firing on the vehicles and condemned what it claimed was “the repeated use of civilian infrastructure by the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, including the use of medical facilities and ambulances for terrorist purposes.”
The attacks came less than a week after Israel renewed its assault across the strip on March 18, breaking a weeks-long ceasefire with Hamas. Since then, Israeli attacks have killed at least 921 Palestinians and injured more than 2,000 others, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health. CNN has no way of independently verifying the numbers and the Israeli government does not allow foreign journalists to independently enter Gaza.
More than 80 people were killed in Gaza following Israeli strikes on Sunday and Monday, medics and health authorities in the enclave said. Dr. Marwan El-Hems, director of field hospitals in Gaza, told CNN that he estimated that 83 to 85 people had been killed because of Israeli military activity since Sunday morning. The total included about 30 on Monday morning.
The news also follows Israel’s decision before the ceasefire collapsed to block humanitarian aid from entering the enclave, in what it described as a move to pressure Hamas into accepting new terms for an extension of the ceasefire rather than proceed with phase two of the truce.
UNOCHA and aid groups accuse Israel of violating international law by blocking the flow of aid into Gaza and of using starvation as a weapon of war. The same organizations have accused Israel of restricting or creating hurdles to the entry of aid throughout the war.
‘Health services must be protected’
International aid and humanitarian organizations have repeatedly condemned the Israeli military’s attacks on medical facilities and personnel.
“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected,” Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General of the IFRC, said in a statement on Sunday.
Hospitals in Gaza – including Nasser Medical Complex, the enclave’s largest functioning hospital – have seen intense bombardment and raids from Israeli forces accusing the facilities of harboring Hamas operatives.
About 400 aid workers, including teachers, doctors and nurses, have been killed in Israeli attacks in the enclave since October 7, 2023, according to OCHA’s latest update released Tuesday. The PRCS says the number of its staff killed in line of duty by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 2023 has now reached 27.
“The occupation’s targeting of Red Crescent medics … can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world,” PCRS said.
Meanwhile, Gaza health officials said the death toll in Gaza since October 7 has surpassed 50,000, marking a grim milestone for a war with no end in sight.

“The occupation has forced all bakeries to shut down entirely, exacerbating the famine crisis that threatens the lives of innocent civilians, particularly children, patients, and the elderly,” the Hamas-controlled Government Media Office in Gaza said Tuesday.
The closures are likely to accelerate the spread of famine in the strip, the head of the local Bakery Owners’ Association, Abdel Nasser Al-Ajrami told the Palestinian Press Agency Safa.
The United Nation’s World Food Programme (WFP) said all 25 of its bakeries in the enclave had shut, citing the lack of flour and fuel.
“Hot meals are continuing, but supplies will last two weeks. WFP will distribute its last food parcels in the next two days,” said Abeer Etefa, the WFP’s communications officer for Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe.
The closures are already having a dire impact on Palestinians, with one man telling CNN his children are nauseated and exhausted from the lack of food.
“I went to every bakery. Every time we ask, they say there’s no flour due to the closure of the crossings. The Israelis control the crossings. We don’t know where to go,” Abdul Rahman Fattayeh said.
Ibrahim al-Kurd, another local, told CNN the situation was “extremely difficult, beyond explanation.”
“I have 40 family members, and I’ve been searching for bread for them since 8 a.m., going around all the bakeries in Deir al-Balah. None are operating,” al-Kurd said. “There’s no flour, no firewood, nothing. Not even water. It’s dire,” he added.
The Israeli government shut down the supply of food and other humanitarian aid into Gaza in early March, in a bid to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and impose new conditions on the extension of the ceasefire.
No aid has entered the enclave for more than three weeks, with the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) saying that this is the longest Gaza has been without any supplies since the war began.
“During the ceasefire, 500–600 trucks arrived daily. Now, nothing,” Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General, said last week.
The blockade has also heavily hit supplies of critical medicine in the Gaza Strip, with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, warning that they are now in short supply or running out.
MSF has begun to ration medications such as painkillers, and its teams are running out of anaesthetics, children’s antibiotics and medicines to treat chronic conditions like epilepsy, hypertension and diabetes, the organization said in a statement Wednesday.
It warned that the lack of medicine could lead to a multitude of health complications and many deaths.
Describing the latest blockade as the worst humanitarian crisis since the war began, Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network, warned the closure of bakeries would impact “hundreds of thousands of people” who rely on them for food.
“The coming days will be very critical on the lives and the health of the Palestinians in Gaza, mainly children, women, and elders,” Al-Shawa said Tuesday, urging the international community to pressure Israel into reopening the crossings.
CNN has reached out to COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for enabling aid to enter Gaza, for a response to the claims.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/01/middleeast/two-arrested-as-investigation-into-qatargate-israel-deepens-intl/index.html,QatarGate: Two arrested as investigation deepens in Israel,2025-04-01 16:02:27,"Two close associates of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been remanded in custody for three days, following their arrest on Monday by Israeli police in connection with an investigation into suspected unlawful ties between the senior aides and Qatar, a case that has become known as QatarGate.
An Israeli court on Tuesday extended the initial detention of Yonatan Urich, Netanyahu’s closest adviser, and former aide Eli Feldstein by three days, saying their release would disrupt an investigation into their suspected involvement in conducting public relations for Qatar. The judge denied the police’s original request for a nine-day detention to conduct their investigation.
In court, the judge stated that a review of the classified materials submitted indicated reasonable suspicion that an American company had contacted one of the suspects to spread negative messages about Egypt, and downplay its role in mediation efforts to release all the October 7 hostages and reach a permanent ceasefire.
Court documents show that Yonatan and Feldstein are suspected by prosecutors to have taken bribes and “worked to transfer messages to journalists in a manner that presented sympathetic articles about Qatar in the media, minimizing Egypt’s role as a fair mediator in the deal, while dictating the media agenda.”
The judge declared that a previous gag order on the proceedings had been rendered meaningless because it had been widely disregarded.
Israeli police and courts have so far declined to respond to CNN’s requests for exact details of the charges.
CNN has reached out to the suspects’ defense attorneys for comment.
The Jerusalem Post’s editor-in-chief Zvika Klein was questioned by police on Monday as part of the investigation but the “nature of any allegations against him has not been specified,” the Israeli media outlet said on Tuesday.
Klein visited Qatar last year “at the direct invitation” of the country and wrote a series of articles for the Post following his visit, according to the newspaper.
Israeli outlet Channel 13 had claimed in a report last month that Klein’s visit to Qatar had been arranged by Feldstein, which Klein denied.
A Qatari government official told CNN the country had been subjected to “a smear campaign” by people who want to see a continuation of the war in Gaza.
“We will continue our mediation efforts, together with the US and our regional partners, and will not be distracted or deterred by those who actively seek to derail the negotiations and prolong the conflict,” the official said.
Significant investigation
Netanyahu also gave testimony on the case to police on Monday, according to a video the prime minister released on his Telegram account. He has claimed the case is politically motivated.
“It’s a political investigation, a political hunt, that’s all this is, there’s nothing else,” Netanyahu said.
Netanyahu has also claimed the investigation is aimed at preventing him from dismissing Ronen Bar, head of the country’s internal security service Shin Bet.
The agency is reported to have recently opened an investigation into allegations that members of Netanyahu’s office inappropriately lobbied on behalf of Qatar – something his office denies.
Israeli media has recently cited Netanyahu’s attempt to disrupt an investigation into QatarGate as his reason for seeking the removal of both Bar and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara.
Despite naming on Monday former navy commander Vice Adm. Eli Sharvit as his pick for the next Shin Bet chief, Netanyahu’s move to dismiss the current head still faces a legal challenge.
The Shin Bet, which monitors domestic threats to Israel, conducted an internal investigation into the October 7, 2023 attacks that determined the agency had “failed in its mission” to prevent Hamas’ deadly assault and kidnapping spree. But it also blamed policies enacted by Netanyahu’s government as contributing factors.
Among them, the Shin Bet said, were Qatar’s years-long payments to Hamas. Those payments were blessed by Israel, whose government believed it was beneficial to drive a political wedge between Gaza and the West Bank.
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said the arrest of two of Netanyahu’s aides “is a breach of trust, a threat to national security, and a severe harm to Israel’s credibility and standing in the world,” warning that “Netanyahu cannot absolve himself of responsibility.”
“If he knew – he is complicit in a terrible failure. If he didn’t know – he is unfit to continue serving as the Prime Minister of Israel,” Lapid said in a statement Tuesday.
Another opposition figure, Benny Gantz, also criticized Netanyahu, saying: “The more the ‘QatarGate’ investigation advances, the more determined Netanyahu becomes in his battle against the institutions responsible for the investigation. The deeper the investigation – the deeper the subversion.”","['Dana Karni', 'Eugenia Yosef', 'Tim Lister', 'Irene Nasser']",en

Lebanon’s Health Ministry said four people were killed, including a woman, and seven injured in the strike early Tuesday, which Israel said had targeted a Hezbollah militant.
Two missiles hit the top three floors of a building in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon’s national news agency NNA reported. Witnesses told Reuters that no evacuation warning was issued ahead of the strike and that families who lived there have now fled to other parts of the city.
Israel’s military said in a statement the militant had allegedly “recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them in planning a significant and imminent terror attack against Israeli civilians.”
Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun condemned the attack. “Israel’s persistence in its aggression requires us to exert more effort to address Lebanon’s friends around the world and rally them in support of our right to full sovereignty over our land,” he said.
Israel’s military said in a statement it had struck and killed Hezbollah “terrorist Hassan Ali Mahmoud Bdeir.”
“Bdeir recently operated in cooperation with the Hamas terrorist organization, directed Hamas terrorists, and assisted them in planning and advancing a significant and imminent terror attack against Israeli civilians,” the statement said, adding that Hezbollah militants’ activities violate the “understandings between Israel and Lebanon.”
The US State Department said Tuesday that Israel was defending itself from cross-border fire from Lebanon.
“Hostilities have resumed because terrorists launched rockets into Israel from Lebanon,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to CNN, adding that Washington supported Israel’s response.
The attack comes just days after Israel launched its first strike on the Lebanese capital since a ceasefire with Hezbollah came into effect in November. Israel accused Hezbollah of launching two rocket attacks from southern Lebanon that crossed Israel’s border, a claim the Iran-backed group denied.
“We will not allow firing on our communities, not even a drizzle… We will attack everywhere in Lebanon against any threat to the state of Israel, and we will ensure that all our residents in the north return to their homes safely,” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday.
The Lebanese army called Friday’s strike on the southern Dahieh neighborhood “a blatant and repeated violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and the security of its citizens, a challenge to international law, and a flagrant breach of the ceasefire agreement.”
The US-brokered ceasefire agreement brought about a significant reduction in violence following more than a year of cross-border strikes and months of a full-scale war.","['Charbel Mallo', 'Irene Nasser', 'Kareem El Damanhoury']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-strategy-gaza-future-intl/index.html,Israel again expands Gaza war as Netanyahu vows he’s changing the Middle East. The endgame is unclear as ever,2025-02-16 00:00:00,"It has become a familiar refrain: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that he is “changing the face of the Middle East.”
It is, he says, “a war of rebirth.”
It is, in a sense, undoubtedly true.
Israel has troops in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. It’s vowed to demilitarize huge swaths of all three – backed by an unquestioning ally in the White House. The war in Gaza, which Israel restarted earlier this month, looks increasingly like it will lead to occupation for months or even years to come.
But Netanyahu is a master tactician, not a master strategist, former Israeli national security officials tell CNN. He has seized opportunities to claw himself back from being in charge during the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust to unimaginable heights of power, at least in Israel.
To cement his legacy, however, and for a grand strategy to materialize, the country and its national security leaders will need to overcome some fundamental and maybe intractable contradictions.
“We didn’t start the war on October 7,” Ophir Falk, a top foreign policy adviser to Netanyahu, told CNN. “But we’re going to win it.”
Gaza looms large
The most difficult problem is also the most obvious: Gaza.
Netanyahu wants “total victory” over Hamas, a goal a top military official derided as sloganeering, or “throwing sand in the eyes of the public.”
The prime minister has never been willing to say what, when the war is over, Gaza should look like, only what it should not be – that is, governed by either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.
“The big problem is with the government itself,” Israel Ziv, a retired Israeli general who once headed the military’s operations department, told CNN. “They are not fully committed to those goals (in Gaza). And now it’s not even clear – not to the army, and not to the public – what the government really wants.”
Netanyahu’s indecision was rewarded when US President Donald Trump proposed that all Palestinians leave Gaza. It is, Netanyahu said, “the only plan that I think can work to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for the surrounding areas.”
His extremist right-wing coalition partners could hardly believe their luck. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich celebrated: Hamas’ attacks on October 7, 2023 would culminate in Palestinians “losing their land forever,” he said.
Though the cabinet has created an agency to facilitate those who want to “voluntarily” leave Gaza, it’s unclear whether the prime minister sees ethnic cleansing – that’s almost certainly what it would be – as a realistic or desirable goal.
“It’s nonsense – don’t take it seriously,” Nitzan Nuriel, former director of the Counter-Terrorism Bureau in the Prime Minister’s Office, told CNN. It’s nothing more than a message to Israeli extremists and Trump, Nuriel said.
But having decided to abandon the ceasefire framework that saw Hamas release 38 hostages earlier this year, Israel went back to maximum pressure: “From now on, negotiations will only take place under fire,” Netanyahu said.
Israel’s defense minister has ordered the military to push forward in Gaza for a “permanent maintenance of the territory.” Seemingly every day, the military orders more Palestinians to once again leave their shelters and evacuate. Netanyahu told Israel’s parliament Wednesday that the operation “includes taking territory, and it includes other things that I will not detail here.”
“If it doesn’t lead to renewed negotiations, then that would be very bad,” Eyal Hulata, former head of Israel’s National Security Council, told CNN. “What we will see is a permanent presence of the IDF fighting the counterinsurgency on the ground.”
The most probable outcome, Nuriel said, is a prolonged occupation of Gaza and the appointment of an Israeli military governor to run its daily affairs – with the hope that “pragmatic” Gulf states will pick up the bill.
“Is this a good idea? I don’t think so,” he said. “But politically, as far as I understand it, this is one of the government’s options. So we will see an offensive for four, five months. At the end of it, we will control all of that land. And at the end of it we will start to manage that piece of land, as we did at the end of the ‘67 war” – when Israel first seized control of Gaza from Egypt.
The unknowns
Gaza also brings with it issues that are rarely discussed in Israel, but which loom large nonetheless.
Netanyahu remains under indictment for alleged war crimes at the International Criminal Court. The Israeli government itself stands accused of genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. (Both vehemently deny the charges.)
There is not a single person in Gaza whose life has not been touched by war. More than 95% have been forced from their homes. Israel has for weeks now blocked all humanitarian aid from entering the strip, and starvation looms.
The government is seeking to destroy the UN agency that provides schooling, medical coverage and employment for millions of Palestinians – accusing UNRWA of failing to weed out extremists in its ranks.
Though Gazans have begun to express more public anger at Hamas, their views towards Israel will have been almost unimaginably hardened over the course of the war. Then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this year that Hamas had recruited more militants than it had lost.
Just as many Palestinians see Hamas’ October 7 attack – heinous as they may find it – as a direct result of 60 years of Israeli occupation, so too may these maximalist policies have unknowable and potentially devastating consequences for Israel.
Saudi normalization
Occupying Gaza also stands between Netanyahu and a key legacy project: normalizing diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia.
“The problem is that the key for this achievement is ending the war in Gaza,” Amos Yadlin, former head of Israeli military intelligence and former defense attaché in Washington, told CNN. “The Saudis will not come if Israel continues the war in Gaza.”
Saudi officials have been explicit on the matter. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has called the war in Gaza a “genocide.” The country’s foreign minister told CNN last year that normalization was “off the table until we have a resolution to Palestinian statehood.”
Israeli policymakers think the Saudis are posturing.
“I don’t really think that that’s on top of their agenda,” an Israeli official told CNN. “And it’s not going to happen,” they said of a Palestinian state. “There’s no other issue on which there’s such consensus in Israel. It’s simply not going to happen.”
A forceful regional response
Israel’s response to the Hamas attack has also brought a more aggressive military posture in Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank – all under pressure from key government ministers who bring a radical, Jewish nationalist ideology previously unseen in the country’s halls of power.
“What it seems like (Netanyahu) has in mind is to use the chaos in a way that would allow him to make the political gains, which he needs,” a former senior official told CNN. “This is not strategic. This is tactical politics. But this is what he is.”
Israel now has a handful of military outposts in southern Lebanon, near the border. It has shown it is willing to regularly strike Hezbollah in a region of Lebanon from which, according to a 2006 UN Security Council resolution, they should be withdrawn. Israel’s year-long shooting war with Hezbollah – followed by a devastating bombing campaign and ground invasion – came in response to Hezbollah attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, on October 8, 2023.
In Syria too, Israel seized upon the fall of the dictator Bashar al-Assad to launch nationwide strikes on military infrastructure, and to occupy the strategic Mount Hermon and a previously demilitarized buffer zone. While Netanyahu claims that Assad’s fall was a “direct result” of Israeli actions against his ally Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon, Nuriel said: “It was obviously not because of us.… We responded to something that happened.
“If you ask me if there is any strategic plan by the prime minister, my answer is no.”
And yet, those series of tactical decisions add up to a common theme in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, Nuriel said. Israeli security officials, he explained, are building similar lines of defense in all these places: “The borderline, fully secured by the IDF. Then a buffer zone, which nobody will be able to enter. And then another area without any ammunition.”
The most uncertain zone of Israeli expansionism is in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. Israel already has at least 150 official settlements there, and the number of outposts that are illegal even under Israeli law has skyrocketed since October 7.
The nationalist extremists in government would love for Israel to annex the West Bank, or at least the large swaths where Jews live, outside the major Palestinian cities – that is, to formally bring it under Israeli law and jurisdiction.
Trump during his first term broke with the rest of the Western world in recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized from Syria in 1967. With his return to the White House, many see some form of Israeli annexation in the West Bank as almost inevitable.
Trump’s pick for ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said he believes Israel has the “title deed” to the West Bank, which he refers to as Judea and Samaria, the biblical name used by some Israelis. (In his confirmation hearing, he told senators that he would defer to the president on annexation.)
Iran
That leaves the biggest unanswered question of them all: Iran.
That nation is, for Netanyahu, the longest-standing bogeyman. Time and again, he casts the government in Tehran as the head of an octopus whose tentacles reach all the front lines on which Israel is fighting.
“As Israel defends itself against Iran in this seven-front war, the lines separating the blessing and the curse could not be more clear,” he told the UN General Assembly last year. (There is no evidence to suggest Iran directed Hamas’ attack on October 7, let alone knew about it in advance.)
In this he has much in common with Trump, for whom preventing Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon is a key goal. Where they diverge is how to get there.
The Israeli national security sphere is awash with talk that Netanyahu is trying to get Trump on board with a preemptive strike to take out Iran’s nuclear facilities – as when Israel destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981. Again and again, he insists that “pressure, pressure, and more pressure” is the only acceptable response to Iran’s nuclear ambitions – hoping that a revolution will upend the regime there.
Trump, on the other hand, has clearly expressed a desire for some sort of deal with Iran – despite his derision for the agreement reached by Barack Obama in 2015. “President Trump made it clear to Ayatollah Khamenei that he wanted to resolve the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program diplomatically – and very soon – and if this was not possible, there would be other ways to resolve the dispute,” a spokesman for the US National Security Council, Brian Hughes, told CNN earlier this month.
An Israeli official denied that there was any disagreement between the two leaders.
“I don’t see the daylight,” the Israeli official told CNN. “Both leaders have expressed explicitly that they will not tolerate a nuclear Iran, and the clock is ticking.”

Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya said in a televised address on Saturday that the militant group had engaged “positively” with the draft deal sent by Egyptian mediators and accepted its terms.
That deal would involve the release of five hostages, including American-Israeli Edan Alexander, in exchange for a renewed ceasefire, a Hamas source told CNN. Hamas expects a return to phase 1 ceasefire conditions, including the entry of humanitarian aid, as well as an agreement to negotiate the second phase of the ceasefire, the source said.
The proposal is similar to one presented several weeks ago by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, although it is not clear whether it also includes the release of additional bodies of deceased hostages.
Al-Hayya added that Hamas has “fully abided” by the terms of the first ceasefire deal and hopes Israel “does not obstruct this proposal.”
Israel responded to the Egyptian offer with a counter-proposal, according to a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister’s office.
Israel’s counter demands the release of 11 living hostages and half of the deceased hostages in return for a 40-day ceasefire, a senior Israeli official told CNN on Sunday.
A total of 24 living hostages are believed to be in Gaza and the bodies of 35 deceased hostages are thought to still be held in the enclave.
“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conducted a series of consultations yesterday, following a proposal received from the mediators. In recent hours, Israel transferred its counter proposal to the mediators, in full coordination with the United States,” the prime minister’s office said on Saturday.
Israel also insisted that during the ceasefire, humanitarian aid will be directed to civilians, and the mediators will ensure that the hostages in captivity receive proper care, including food, according to the Israeli official.
Israel earlier this month renewed attacks in Gaza and imposed a complete blockade of humanitarian aid entering the enclave, warning that its forces will maintain a permanent presence in parts of Gaza until the release of the remaining living hostages.
According to health authorities in Gaza, at least 50,277 Palestinians have been killed and another 114,095 injured since Israel’s military offensive began in the enclave, following deadly terror attacks launched by Hamas on October 7, 2023.

The Israeli military is stepping up its renewed campaign in Gaza, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying efforts to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages were “working” and vowing to implement Donald Trump’s hugely controversial scheme to relocate Palestinians from the territory.
Twenty people were also injured in the strike on the Al-Mawasi area, Khan Younis’s Director of Civil Defense Yamen Abu Suleiman told CNN, warning the death toll would likely rise.
A local hospital confirmed the fatalities so far, saying five children had been killed.
Video of the aftermath of the strike shows some of the child victims wearing new Eid clothing. In Middle Eastern tradition, children wear new clothes to celebrate the three-day holiday.
In the footage, a man is seen dragging a child toward the hospital, asking: “What was these children’s fault? They did nothing.”
CNN has approached the Israel Defense Forces for comment.
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are observing Eid this year in the face of dwindling aid supplies and a mounting death toll in the strip.
“Every year, I’m used to baking Eid cookies for my children,” one displaced woman, Ameneh Shaqla, told CNN. “But because of the current situation and how expensive everything has become, I was only able to prepare one kilogram — just to bring them some joy so they don’t stay sad because of the war.”
Abdel Fattah Khalil Karnawi, a street vendor, told of the soaring prices for clothing. “We came to the market to get Eid clothes for the children. Unfortunately, the circumstances are tough and prices are very high.”
Israel resumed its offensive on Gaza almost two weeks ago, shattering a two-month-old ceasefire. It imposed a complete blockade of humanitarian aid entering the enclave, warning that its forces would maintain a permanent presence in parts of Gaza until the release of the remaining 24 hostages who are believed to still be alive. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the enclave since then.
Al-Mawasi, a coastal region west of the city of Rafah, has repeatedly come under Israeli attacks, even though it was previously designated by Israel as a “humanitarian area.” Thousands of Palestinians have fled to Al-Mawasi, living for months in makeshift tents made of cloth and nylon, with little access to humanitarian relief.
In comments made on Sunday morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to step up the military campaign, saying the pressure on Hamas was “working.”
“It works because it operates simultaneously: on one hand, it crushes Hamas’ military and governmental capabilities and, on the other, it creates the conditions for the release of our hostages. This is exactly what we are doing,” Netanyahu said at a government meeting.
Rejecting assertions Israel was unwilling to negotiate, he added that “cracks” were showing in Hamas following the renewal of the offensive and said Israel would implement “the Trump Plan — the voluntary emigration plan,” a scheme Trump himself appears to have walked back on.
New ceasefire proposal
Sunday’s strike comes as Hamas has agreed to a new Egyptian proposal to release five hostages, including the American-Israeli Edan Alexander, in exchange for a renewed ceasefire, a Hamas source told CNN.
The proposal is similar to one presented several weeks ago by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, although it is not clear whether it also includes the release of additional bodies of deceased hostages.
In exchange for the release of five hostages, Hamas expects a return to phase 1 ceasefire conditions, including the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, as well as an agreement from Israel to negotiate the second phase of the ceasefire, the source said.

“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conducted a series of consultations yesterday, following a proposal received from the mediators. In recent hours, Israel transferred its counter-proposal to the mediators, in full coordination with the United States,” the office said.
Netanyahu is facing competing demands at home from his right-wing coalition who want to increase pressure on Hamas and families of the remaining hostages who fear more military action could endanger their loved ones.

The United Nations’ agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Thursday eight of its staff had been killed in Gaza over the past week, while the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said nine of its emergency medical technicians (EMTs) have been missing since Sunday following an incident in which Israeli forces fired on ambulances and fire trucks in the southern Gaza governorate of Rafah.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said that it fired on the ambulances and fire trucks in Rafah because they were being used as cover by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters.
In a separate incident, Israeli strikes near a community kitchen in Gaza on Thursday killed a World Central Kitchen (WCK) volunteer and injured six others “as meals were being distributed,” according to the US-based non-profit.
In response, the IDF told CNN that the WCK incident is under review.
“The IDF is in contact with the organization to verify the details thoroughly,” it added in a statement.
The attacks came after Israel renewed attacks across the strip on March 18, breaking a weeks-long ceasefire with Hamas. Since then, at least 921 Palestinians have been killed and 2,054 others injured, Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported Saturday.
The news also follows Israel’s decision before the ceasefire collapsed to block humanitarian aid from entering the enclave, in what it described as a move to pressure Hamas into accepting new terms for an extension of the ceasefire rather than proceed with phase two of the truce.
The UN and aid groups accuse Israel of violating international law by blocking the flow of aid into Gaza and of using starvation as a weapon of war. The same organizations have accused Israel of restricting or creating hurdles to the entry of aid throughout the war.
Noting the deaths of the UNRWA staff, the agency’s Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini called Thursday for the ceasefire to resume and for Israel to lift its blockade on aid.
“No humanitarian aid has entered Gaza for more than three weeks now,” Lazzarini said, noting that before the ceasefire collapsed between 500 and 600 aid trucks had been entering the strip on a daily basis.
“This is longest that Gaza has been without any supplies since the war began,” Lazzarini said.
Israel launched its war in Gaza following Hamas’ October 2023 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Since then, Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 50,200 Palestinians and injured more than 114,000 people, the health ministry in Gaza says.
With the return to hostilities, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza are once again at risk of “severe hunger and malnutrition,” the World Food Programme (WFP) warned in a statement on Thursday, stressing that its food stocks are enough to support its operations for a maximum of two weeks.
About 10 community kitchens were forced to close in Gaza since the ceasefire collapsed “due to hostilities and energy shortages,” according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Tuesday. The office also warned that supplies of cooking gas were available “only in extremely limited quantities at exorbitant prices,” leaving families with few options aside from the community kitchens.
UNRWA’s Lazzarini said parents are unable to find food for their children, hunger is increasing and the risk of disease is spreading.
“The siege must be lifted and crossings must re-open for a standard flow of humanitarian aid and commercial supplies,” Lazzarini said.
About 400 aid workers, including teachers, doctors and nurses, have been killed in Israeli attacks in the enclave since October 7, 2023, OCHA said in an update earlier this week.
The death toll includes 289 UN staff and 34 PRCS workers as well as 76 from other NGOs.
EMTs and Civil Defense workers missing
According to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, its EMTs went missing in the Tel Sultan area of Rafah “after being besieged and targeted by Israeli forces” on Sunday.
It said its teams were only able to start searching for the missing staff on Thursday as it had previously been denied access to the area.
Gaza’s Civil Defense said that six of its staff also went missing after being dispatched to the same area last weekend following what it described as a “sudden incursion by the Israeli occupation forces, the killing and injuring of dozens, and the besieging” of PRCS vehicles.
The PRCS said they had recovered the body of one of the Civil Defense team members on Thursday.
The Gaza Civil Defense said it had encountered scenes of devastation in Rafah while searching for a team of missing emergency workers.
Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said Friday that the body of one emergency worker who was among a nine-strong team that went to Rafah on Sunday had been found.
Basal said that when Civil Defense and Red Crescent teams were finally granted access to the area they found “massive destruction” and widespread bulldozing.
“We found our vehicles and the Red Crescent vehicles destroyed,” and subsequently the body of one worker that had been buried by bulldozers was retrieved, Basal said.
The Israeli military told CNN its forces had opened fire at “suspicious vehicles” advancing toward troops without prior coordination, headlights or emergency signals during an operation against Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants in southern Gaza last Sunday.
It said that it had “eliminated a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists” by firing on the vehicles and condemned what it claimed was “the repeated use of civilian infrastructure by the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, including the use of medical facilities and ambulances for terrorist purposes.”
Since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza in October 2023, 19 PRCS members have been killed while on duty, according to the society.
“We cannot bear to add more names to this tragic list,” a spokesperson for the society said Thursday. “(We call) on the international community to take serious measures to protect our medical teams.”
The society said the search and rescue operation would resume Friday.
Volunteer killed as meals handed out
The World Central Kitchen said Israeli strikes near a community kitchen in Gaza on Thursday killed one of its volunteers and injured six others “as meals were being distributed.”
“Our hearts are heavy today as we mourn the loss of one of our volunteers in Gaza,” WCK said in a statement.
In April 2024, a series of Israeli military strikes killed seven WCK staffers in Gaza, drawing international condemnation and prompting a rare public acknowledgment from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a promise to investigate the “tragic incident.”
The US-based non-profit that focuses on fighting hunger around the world vowed Thursday to continue its work in the strip.
“We will continue to support community kitchens throughout the region and operate our field kitchens where possible, based on daily assessments,” it said in a statement. “We hope for peace for all and a lasting ceasefire.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/middleeast/israel-strikes-southern-beirut-intl/index.html,Israel strikes southern Beirut for the first time since November ceasefire,2025-03-28 12:21:49,"The Israeli military struck southern Beirut on Friday for the first time since November, after Israel said that two projectiles had been fired from Lebanon.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it “struck a terrorist infrastructure site used to store UAVs by Hezbollah’s Aerial Unit (127) in the area of Dahieh, a key Hezbollah terrorist stronghold in Beirut.”
The IDF said Hezbollah “systematically embeds its terrorist infrastructure amidst the Lebanese civilian population, a clear example of Hezbollah’s cynical exploitation of Lebanese civilians as human shields.”
The strike came after Israel accused Hezbollah of launching two rocket attacks from southern Lebanon that crossed Israel’s border. Hezbollah has denied this and said it is committed to its ceasefire with Israel.
Shortly before the strikes on Lebanon’s capital, the IDF issued evacuation orders to Lebanese residents in a neighborhood in southern Beirut.
“To everyone located in the building marked in red on the map, as well as the surrounding buildings: you are in close proximity to Hezbollah-affiliated facilities,” the IDF said. “For your safety and the safety of your families, you must evacuate these buildings immediately and move at least 300 meters away, as indicated on the map.”
The area is home to a number of schools. The Lebanese government suspended classes on Friday after Israel’s evacuation order, telling “all students, teachers, and administrative staff” to leave the area, according to Lebanon’s state news agency NNA.
Israel also said on Friday that it had struck “Hezbollah command centers, terrorist infrastructure sites, launchers, and terrorists” in multiple locations across southern Lebanon. An Israeli strike on Kfar Tebnit in the southern governorate of Nabatiyeh killed three people, including a woman, NNA reported, citing the Lebanese ministry of health. At least 18 other people were injured, including six children and eight women.
According to an Israeli official, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz and other officials were convening Friday for a security assessment about Lebanon.
Katz said that in response to the two projectiles fired at Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel, Lebanon’s capital Beirut would “be treated the same.”
“If there is no peace in Kiryat Shmona and the Galilee communities, there will be no peace in Beirut either,” he said, according to a statement from the defense ministry.
The Lebanese army said on Friday it had found a rocket launch site from which projectiles could have been fired at Israel, adding that it “has begun an investigation to determine the identity of those launching them.”
The army added that Israel’s strike on Lebanon represents “a blatant and repeated violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and the security of its citizens, a challenge to international law, and a flagrant breach of the ceasefire agreement.”
Hezbollah said on its Telegram channel that the incident appears to be aimed at creating “pretexts for the continuation of the Israeli aggression against Lebanon.”
Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said that, following Friday’s Israeli strikes, his government had been in touch with US officials regarding the ceasefire that came into effect in November.
“There is a ceasefire in place, and both sides are expected to respect the agreement,” Aoun said.
Meanwhile, Netanyahu said Friday that his country would “attack everywhere” in Lebanon in response to any threat against Israel.
“Those who have not yet internalized the new situation in Lebanon received today another example of our determination,” Netanyahu said. “We will not allow firing on our communities, not even a drizzle … We will attack everywhere in Lebanon against any threat to the state of Israel, and we will ensure that all our residents in the north return to their homes safely.”
Tensions have risen in the region in recent weeks following the most significant eruption of violence between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group since a ceasefire signed four months ago brought an uneasy calm to the border.
Israel has conducted dozens of strikes, mostly in southern Lebanon on what it calls Hezbollah targets, since the ceasefire.
On Thursday, the Israeli military struck several vehicles in southern Lebanon as it claimed to target Hezbollah militants in the area. At least six people were killed, Lebanese state media reported.
Israel and Hezbollah exchanged cross-border attacks for more than a year following the launch of Israel’s war in Gaza in October 2023.
In September of last year, Israel launched an intense ground and aerial campaign, decimating the militant group’s leadership and killing more than 2,500 in the following months, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",[],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/middleeast/israel-young-people-extremist-views-intl-cmd/index.html,Extremist views are all that many young Israelis have ever known,2025-03-21 00:00:00,"On a bright Sunday afternoon outside of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, a group of teenage girls was creating chaos.
“Bibi, Bibi, we love Bibi,” they yelled, using a popular nickname for the Israeli leader, as one spat into a “Bring Home the Hostages” hat before stepping on it in front of hundreds of silent protesters who had gathered to call for the hostages’ return.
Sixteen-year-old Sarah was among the teenage agitators who had skipped school to voice their support for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition, whose recent reignition of the war in Gaza has been criticized for endangering the lives of the 24 living hostages, and for serving as a distraction from the prime minister’s array of political crises. CNN is using pseudonyms for the teenagers featured in this article as their guardians were not present at the time of reporting.
“If we don’t do war right now, terror is going to come back again,” Sarah said, as her friends blared a song, “Bibi, Bibi, our friend,” through a portable speaker at pro-democracy protesters leaving another nearby demonstration.
Sarah said she supports Israel’s continued bombardment of Gaza and trusts that Netanyahu’s plan will ensure the best path forward for the security of Israel and her future – one she envisions without Palestinian participation.
“I don’t love any Arabim,” she said, using an English-Hebrew hybrid to refer to Arabs, who make up around 20% of Israel’s citizenry (another five million live under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza.) “I don’t have Arab friends because I know some day that they are going to cheat me, kill me,” she added, regurgitating the kind of inflammatory and dehumanizing rhetoric that many Israeli politicians and leaders have long normalized, but that has become more extreme since the start of the war.
“Those children will grow up to be terrorists,” Sarah said. Her friends nodded in agreement.
Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians since October 2023 – among them 15,600 children – according to the health ministry there.
Days before, at another demonstration just outside of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, Maya, another 16-year-old girl, went even further with her language.
“I think we should kill all of them,” she said, referring to Palestinians.
The teenager told CNN she supported US President Donald Trump’s call to relocate Palestinians in Gaza to third countries – a “voluntary” emigration plan approved by Israel’s cabinet on Sunday that critics say could amount to ethnic cleansing.
“It’s never been so bad,” Batya Kenine, a Jerusalem-based realtor, who had come to support the silent protesters in Jerusalem, said of the teenagers’ divisive rhetoric.
“When I was 18, I too voted for the most extremist party. They said: ‘We’ll fight, we’ll go, we’ll demolish.’ But I grew up and understood that’s not the way to live in this country – always fighting, fighting. People in Gaza, you know, they are human as well,” Kenine said.
The embrace of right-wing attitudes by Jewish Israeli youth is not a new phenomenon, analysts say, but it has become more extreme in recent years, particularly in the era of Netanyahu – who, having been in office for 12 of the past 14 years, is the only leader that teenagers like Sarah have ever really known.
“When you don’t resolve military conflicts, you have to convince your population of why you’re there, and then you have to convince them by telling them the other side is irredeemable, genetically disposed to be an existential threat,” Dahlia Scheindlin, a Tel-Aviv based political analyst, told CNN.
That messaging has resonated with many young Jewish Israelis, who overwhelmingly identify as right-wing, and who helped to usher in Netanyahu’s latest government, the most extreme in Israel’s history.
A large majority (73%) of Israeli Jews between the ages of 15 and 24 define themselves as right-wing, compared with 46% of Jewish Israelis aged 65 and above, according to research published in January 2023 by the Jerusalem-based think tank the Israel Democracy Institute, the most recent of its kind.
For many Israelis, that’s not surprising.
Alon-Lee Green, the founding co-director of Standing Together, a progressive grassroots movement, told CNN that young people aren’t at fault for the extremist attitudes that are dividing wider Israeli society.
“It starts at the top,” he said.
“Young people in Israel have never encountered a leader that says that we can go in a different direction, that says that there is an option to not go to war, to not deepen the occupation, to not deepen the conflict or violence with other people,” Green said.
Netanyahu has only ever paid the most perfunctory allegiance to the idea of a two-state solution with the Palestinians. Since Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack, he has insisted that statehood would be a “reward” for the assault.
Those attitudes are trickling down to even the most left-wing parts of Israeli society, one mother of a pre-teen told CNN.
One mother, who asked not to use her name to protect her daughter’s identity, said that her 11-year-old attends a school in a liberal suburb of Tel Aviv, and that children in her class have thrown shoes or objects at maps of Gaza, and play games that include “death to Arabs” in the playground. On a school field trip to a local pool, one of her daughter’s friends said she wouldn’t enter the water after Palestinian children had swum in it. And when her daughter’s best friend asked who her mom was seeing – she is divorced and her partner is a Palestinian man – her child “froze.”
“She said to me: ‘Mom, I realized in that moment that I couldn’t say (his name) because they wouldn’t be my friends anymore.’”
Such attitudes are also reflected in online trends, promoted by young Israeli content creators.
In one of those trends, content creators mock the hardships faced by Palestinian children in Gaza by pranking their parents or grandparents by pretending to represent a fictional humanitarian organization asking for donations for Palestinian children. The parents normally react with outrage before the pranksters reveal themselves.
Other recent viral videos show Israelis making fun of Palestinians in Gaza unable to access water by running the tap and turning the lights on and off. Israel cut off the electricity supply to a desalination plant for drinking water in Gaza earlier this month, shortly after blocking the entry of humanitarian aid.
“When extremist narratives are something that you’ve been fed your entire life and when a moment of such extreme violence, like the Hamas attacks of October 7, happens… we see these trends of completely losing the ability to recognize humanity on the other side,” said Green, of Standing Together.
His organization, which has a large social media following, attempts to counter such rhetoric in the hope its message will spill out into wider society. On its social media platforms, the movement urges people to see Palestinians as fellow humans, as well as calling for an end to the war, through a lasting ceasefire and hostage deal, and reinforcing the understanding that there are innocent people “on the other side.”
But it is bombarded with “daily attacks on those truths,” said Green, who estimates that there are no less than “hundreds of thousands” of Israelis that have written vile and dehumanizing responses to the organization’s posts. Those comments come without consequence, he said.
Nobody is saying, “’Wait, maybe this is not a line we should cross’ – because other people are laughing with you,” he said, noting that no members of government – even from the left-wing opposition – are encouraging a stop to that type of behavior.
The Tel Aviv mom thinks that sort of pushback would force all of society – regardless of political allegiance – to reevaluate the way in which it operates.
Jewish Israelis are intentionally separated from their Palestinian counterparts, she said, noting that multiple human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have said that Israel’s treatment of Palestinians constitutes apartheid. Israel has denounced that characterization as antisemitic.
“If Israelis actually ever meet their other and understand they’re okay, then this whole plan, this whole invention, falls apart. And I think it’s the greatest fear of the government, but also the greatest fear of the people here: that they themselves would hate to wake up and understand that it’s all been for nothing,” she said.
Green believes that young people can change, arguing that the only way to counter extremism is to model a different kind of behavior for young people – and that protecting Palestinians and demanding peace is in Israelis’ own interest.
“We are the only ones that will determine what kind of a society we are. It’s not Hamas, it’s us,” he said.
As the Jerusalem demonstration began to wind down Sunday, some of the teenagers gathered close to compare notes on their favorite Taylor Swift songs while others yelled “Bibi, Bibi” at a group of pro-democracy LGBTQ+ activists leaving the rally.
One of the activists yelled back, “Enough.” The heckling carried on.",['Kara Fox'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/middleeast/ballal-palestinian-oscar-settler-assault-interview-intl-cmd/index.html,Hamdan Ballal: ‘No Other Land’ director says settler assault won’t push him from his home,2025-03-27 04:01:52,"In a small village in the Hebron hills of the occupied West Bank, Hamdan Ballal stood outside his house in a track suit with a black eye.
He held the hand of his 18-month-old daughter, who stood in a pool of his dried blood.
Things looked quite different for the award-winning director just weeks ago. He had flown to Los Angeles to accept an Oscar for the film, “No Other Land,” a documentary he co-directed about the violence and forced displacement of Palestinian villagers for illegal Israeli settlements in those same hills.
Ballal was attacked by a mob of Israeli settlers in front of his home, in the village of Susya on Monday evening.
“I thought they would kill me,” he said.
Ballal told CNN that a group of settlers arrived to his village and started to attack his neighbors, two farmers in their 60s, as night fell. When he tried to document the violence, three masked settlers, including one who had previously attacked him and is known to authorities, came after him, he said, beating him outside his front door as his wife Lamya, and their three small children screamed in fear for his – and their – lives.
Meanwhile, Ballal said, Israeli soldiers soon arrived outside his home, where they shot live rounds into the air.
He said one soldier pushed his rifle into his leg and told him, “’After (shooting) in the air, I will put the shot in your body.’”
After the attack, Ballal and two other Palestinians were taken away by Israeli soldiers and detained in a military facility in the settlement of Kiryat Arba, where he said he was handcuffed, blindfolded and beaten.
The Israeli military called Ballal’s allegations that he was beaten in custody “baseless.”
Attacks on Palestinian farmers and activists in the occupied West Bank are not new.
However, the ferocity of the attack – and Ballal’s subsequent detention – made him feel that the settlers – and the Israeli military – were taking revenge for their film and its international reach.
“At that moment, I thought because of my Oscar, they wanted to kill me,” he said.
In detention, Ballal, who doesn’t speak Hebrew, said he heard the soldiers laughing when they said his name and the word “Oscar.”
The Israeli military said the Palestinian detainees were given medical treatment and “handcuffed in accordance with operational protocol.”
They accused Ballal of throwing stones at soldiers and said that he had been detained on suspicion of rock hurling, property damage, and endangering regional security.
“They change everything,” Ballal said of the military’s interpretation of the events.
“Why did the settlers come here to my house? To say hi to me? Or to give me flowers? No, they came here to attack, to kill, to push you to leave your home,” he said, adding that many Palestinian villagers eventually leave their homes after years of sustained violence.
“When they have the law in their hand, they can do whatever they want,” Ballal said of the settlers, underscoring what multiple human rights organizations have said about Israel’s role in backing settler violence – and settler impunity.
Amnesty International has called settler violence “part of a decades long state-backed campaign to dispossess, displace and oppress Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, under Israel’s system of apartheid,” and that “Israeli forces have a track record of enabling settler violence.”
Israel denounces any characterization of their treatment of Palestinians as apartheid as antisemitic. CNN has reached out to the prime minister’s office for comment on its settler policies.
Behind his house, Ballal looked to his fields, where a perimeter of settler outposts were visible. He said that his family haven’t farmed much since Israel’s war in Gaza began following Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel.
“We didn’t plow it after October 7 because of the danger from the settlers,” he said.
Settler outposts are often established by Israeli settlers on hilltops with a few caravans and sometimes livestock to mark their claim.
The number of those outposts have expanded by nearly 50% since October 7, according to a joint report shared with CNN by Peace Now and Kerem Navot, two Israeli advocacy groups that oppose settlements and track their development.
Such land grabs go hand-in-hand with an escalation in violence by Israeli security forces and settlers against Palestinians, paving the way for settlement expansion, which is documented in Ballal’s film.
That violence has become even worse since the re-election of US President Donald Trump, a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government’s settlement expansion policy in the West Bank, activists say.
In early January, Trump rescinded Biden-era sanctions on far-right settler groups and individuals accused of involvement in violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. And during his first term, Trump abandoned the long-held position that Israeli settlement expansion in occupied Palestinian territories are illegal, contrary to most international law.
From January 2024 to 2025, at least 1,420 incidents of settler violence in the occupied West Bank were recorded, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Those incidents include settlers reportedly killing five Palestinians, including a child, and injuring 360 others, including 35 children, according to OCHA.
More than 26,100 Palestinian-owned trees – which are vital to the local economy – were also vandalized in that period, OCHA said.
On Sunday, Netanyahu’s cabinet approved a plan to separate and legalize 13 settlement outposts in the occupied West Bank, a move that his far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich hailed as a move toward what he called “actual sovereignty” in the West Bank.
For Ballal, the assault – and Netanyahu’s moves – are even more of a reason to continue to fight for his community.
“I brought myself in this circle (of activism and filmmaking) because of my community, my villages – I need justice for them. Because of that, we made this movie, to bring attention to what’s happening in this area and what is happening there.”
Later in the afternoon, settlers brought their cows and sheep to graze on the farm next to Ballal’s land.
The settlers were accompanied by Israeli soldiers.
Ballal said that no amount of intimidation – from settlers or from the government – will push him from his home.
Standing under the sun, he added: “No other home. No other land.”","['Kara Fox', 'Kareem Khadder', 'Jeremy Diamond']",en

Israel, he says, is primarily to blame for Gaza’s misery, but Hamas – which controls Gaza – also carries responsibility.
“We are oppressed by the occupation army (Israel) and we are oppressed by Hamas,” Abu Zaid told CNN. “Hamas launched the October 7 operation, and today we are paying the price,” he said, referring to the militant group’s 2023 attacks on Israel that led to the war.
Palestinians demonstrated against Hamas in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, in what appeared to be the largest protest against the militant group since the October 7 attacks. A second day of protests took place Wednesday, with demonstrations in both Beit Lahia and Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza.
Video of Tuesday’s protest in Beit Lahia showed large crowds, estimated to be hundreds of people by a CNN journalist on the ground, marching through the streets, chanting: “For god’s sake, Hamas out,” “Hamas terrorists” and “We want an end to the war.” Similar language was used at Wednesday’s protest in Deir al-Balah, with signs bearing messages like “We Want to Live,” and “Stop the Genocide.”
Participants at Wednesday’s events told CNN they blamed both Israel and Hamas for the devastation to the enclave.
“Our message is to the Israeli army to stop the bloodshed and the war that has drained our energy and caused us to lose all our loved ones and friends,” said Mahmoud Haj Ahmad, a surgeon at Kamal Adwan Hospital who attended the Beit Lahia protest. “Our final message is to Hamas: Enough is enough. You have ruled long enough; give others a chance, and let others come.”
Another protester in Beit Lahia, lawyer Mohammed Attalah, said, “Our message to the free world is that we are living in oppressive conditions and forced displacement.”
“Our demand is that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. This chaos that they have created is enough.”
More than 1,200 people were killed in the October 7 attacks on Israel and 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s subsequent war on Hamas in Gaza has so far killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the health ministry there, flattened large swathes of the territory and spurred a devastating humanitarian crisis.
The death toll in the enclave has surged in recent days following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, with Israel relaunching its ground operation in Gaza and pledging to intensify its operations. The crisis has been compounded by Israel’s decision to halt all aid from entering the enclave.
UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said on Wednesday that 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.1 million had been displaced between October 7, 2023, and January 2025.
Many Palestinians who don’t support Hamas often refrain from criticizing it publicly, fearing social ostracization, as the militant group is seen by some as the only party actively resisting Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land. Others hide their support for the group, wary of being targeted by Israel.
Raed Abu Hamouda, a Palestinian from northern Gaza, told CNN he wanted to participate in the protest but could not reach the gathering. Hamas and other Palestinian factions in the enclave do not listen to people’s voices, he said.
“The people’s voices must come before the sound of gunpowder,” Abu Hamouda said, adding that Palestinians should have one unified government that can receive international and regional support.
“People have long wanted to protest,” he said. Many were reluctant, however, fearing “lack of protection” on the streets and “accusations of treason” by other Palestinians, he added.
Abu Hamouda also worried that the Israeli government might take advantage of the protests, which would undermine their movement.
In a Wednesday speech at Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the Gaza protests, saying this “shows that our policy is working.”
“In recent days, we have seen something we’ve never seen before – open protests in the Gaza Strip against Hamas rule,” Netanyahu said.
An Islamist organization with a military wing, Hamas has ruled Gaza since 2007, after it beat rival political party Fatah in elections and expelled the Palestinian Authority from the enclave. The group first came into being in 1987. It was an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist group that was founded in the late 1920s in Egypt.
Israel, under international law, has been the occupying power in Gaza since long before the October 7 attack, as it has always controlled the points of entry and exit. Hamas, like most Palestinian factions and political parties, says that it is trying to liberate the Palestinian territories.
Hamas is designated as a terrorist group by the United States, the European Union and Israel.
Protests are ‘spontaneous,’ Hamas says
Hamas’ Government Media Office (GMO) in Gaza has said that the anti-Hamas slogans were “spontaneous” and “do not reflect the general national position.”
“Any spontaneous slogans or positions issued by some demonstrators against the resistance’s approach do not express the general national position,” the GMO told CNN in a statement. “Rather, they come as a result of the unprecedented pressure our people are experiencing and the occupation’s constant attempts to incite internal strife and divert attention from its ongoing crimes.”
The Hamas office said Palestinians’ right to express their opinions and participate in peaceful demonstrations is a “legitimate right, and an essential part of the national values we believe in and defend,” adding that the protests were reflective of the “tremendous pressure and daily massacres our people are subjected to.”
Abdullah Ahmed, an activist from Jabalia, said there are concerns Hamas will crack down on protests if they continue.
“There is fear and worry about participating in these demonstrations,” he told CNN.
Ahmed said that pressure has nonetheless mounted on Gazans, and that many were further devastated to return north and find their homes turned to rubble.
“Why now? Because people are squeezed.”
Hamas still has a substantial support base in Gaza, however. One supporter of the group in Gaza, who asked not to be named for security reasons, told CNN that he believes Hamas “remains strong” and that there are still people in the enclave who are interested in joining Hamas’ campaign against Israel. He also downplayed the protests, saying that the majority of Gazans are “too worried about finding food and water” to get involved.
Then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in January that “Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it is lost.”
“Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas militants regroup and re-emerge because there’s nothing else to fill the void,” he said at in a speech at the Atlantic Council just days before his term as top US diplomat came to an end.
Gazans’ support for the October 7 attack appears to have oscillated in recent months. A survey conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research said in June that 57% of Gazans believed that the attack was the right decision, down from 71% just three months earlier.
As the war has dragged on, living conditions have only deteriorated further in Gaza.
“Our demands are to feed our people, to quench their thirst, to see our children educated and not dying, torn to pieces before our eyes,” Abu Zaid told CNN.
Asked whether he feared retribution from Hamas for protesting, Abu Zaid said it is hard to fear persecution when the enclave is rampant with suffering.
“There is no more fear. Death can happen at any minute, we’ve seen death with our eyes,” he said. “The smell of blood is everywhere.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/europe/israel-embraces-france-far-right-intl/index.html,"Israel embraces France’s far-right, turning a blind eye to its Nazi past",2025-03-26 12:48:20,"A generation ago, it would have been unthinkable: the leader of France’s far-right party – an organization infamously founded by Nazis – invited to speak at an Israeli antisemitism conference.
But on Thursday, Jordan Bardella, leader of France’s National Rally party, will take to the stage in Jerusalem – a victory both symbolic and political for the far-right lawmaker as Israel seeks new friends around the world.
It’s a stunning reversal of political norms. Far-right leaders across Europe, desperate for mainstream acceptance, are seeking common cause with Israel in demonizing Muslims sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose party has long seen itself as a natural ally of right-wing movements around the world, is giving his stamp of approval to a movement historically shunned by Jews.
It is all the more surprising because antisemitism remains a core ideology of most ring-wing extremists – who have been behind some of the most deadly attacks on Jews in the West in recent years.
Unlikely bedfellows
In France, the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023 may have been the touchpaper for the public melding of far-right and Israeli positions, but it’s been an evolution decades in the making.
National Rally was a 2018 rebranding of the National Front, which was founded in 1972 by Jean-Marie Le Pen together with wartime Nazi collaborators and veterans of France’s colonial disasters in Algeria and then-Indochina. The youthful Bardella, a loyal disciple of Le Pen’s daughter, Marine, has helped rehabilitate and detoxify the movement’s image as he seeks to invigorate a new generation of far-right voters.
French Jews – the largest such community in Europe – have not been immune to his charms, especially as he shifts his movement’s ideological crosshairs away from Jews to Muslim and migrant populations.
Many have “become receptive to the far-right’s rhetoric,” Rabbi Emile Ackermann of Paris told CNN. Members of his congregation have been attacked or, out of fear, stopped wearing Jewish headdress or removed Jewish symbols – like the mezuzah that graces doors – from their houses, he said.
The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions (CRIF) in France, in partnership with the Ministry of Interior, recorded 1,570 antisemitic acts in the country in 2024 – more than triple the number logged in 2022.
Parties like National Rally, he said, “are perceived as the only ones able to defend Jews” – against what far-right parties have billed as the “Islamist” threat, Ackermann said.
After years of the country’s worst terror attacks, the French far right has “surfed the security wave in France,” Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Cote d’Azur, told CNN. A secondary motive was to seduce the (small Jewish electorate, he added.
Indeed, Bardella canceled a speech at the US Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February after former Trump adviser Steve Bannon made what some likened to a Nazi salute. Bannon deniedthe accusation.
On Monday, Bardella told France’s BFMTV that he was “not seeking to instrumentalize” antisemitism for political gain, hitting back at comments from the CRIF chief Yonathan Arfi, who had said that the country’s Jewish bodies had always had a “distrust” of the French far right.
In the mind of the far right, “supporting Israel and fighting against terrorism, it’s fighting against Islamism,” Martigny said.
Political chameleon
The growing acceptability of the European far right coincides with a rightward shift in Israel.
Netanyahu now governs alongside Itamar Ben Gvir, a minister who was once considered too extreme even to serve in the Israeli military, and who carries a conviction for supporting a terror organization.
The decision to invite someone like Bardella to speak in Jerusalem has “been coming for a while,” said Daniel Shek, a retired career Israeli diplomat who served as ambassador to France from 2006 to 2010.
Amichai Chikli, Israel’s minister for diaspora affairs, who organized the conference, “has been promoting this idea that extreme right parties across Europe and beyond are a natural allies of Israel,” Shek said. “And therefore all their history, their ideological roots, becomes insignificant as long as they support the Israeli government and hate Muslims.”
Indeed, Shek said, “in the eyes of the current government the only antisemites are Muslims and the extreme left.”
The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks a soaring number of white supremacist incidents, says that geographic location is a far more important indicator of antisemitic views than religion.
The decision to invite Bardella and others from far-right parties was controversial enough that Israeli President Isaac Herzog decided not to host the opening night of the antisemitism conference, his spokesperson confirmed to CNN.
Netanyahu, who often presents himself as the defender of Jews all around the world, has declared that he will “never allow the atrocities of history to recur – we will never capitulate to antisemitism or terrorism.”
Shek’s views are not universal among former Israeli diplomats. Avi Pazner, who also served as ambassador to France, in the 1990s, said the National Rally had “evolved.”
“I know exactly the evil man that Jean Marie Le Pen was – the notorious antisemite. But I can also see now that his party has completely changed,” Pazner told CNN. “In our tradition, when somebody expresses remorse, and it is true remorse, you should embrace him and not push him away.”
When Shek headed European affairs at Israel’s foreign ministry, he said, he was constantly batting away attempts by Marine Le Pen – Jean Marie’s daughter and Bardella’s predecessor – to come to Israel.
“It was a constant issue,” he said.
In the end, he said, the Israeli government should listen to the majority of French Jews, who despite their desire for law and order, are skeptical of the far-right.
“My view was always we take our lead from the local Jewish communities,” he said. “It’s simply a stab in the back to go around them.”
Whatever Bardella’s views, Shek said, the prospect of the party once led by Jean Marie Le Pen attending a conference in Jerusalem is too much to bear. “He is not a private person. He represents a party and a movement that has very deep roots in antisemitism and Holocaust denial.”
Spurned invites
The increasing embrace of Bardella and his party among the French Jewish community is by no means universal.
In France’s famously secular state, pollsters are not permitted to ask for a respondent’s religion, so it is impossible to know the exact percentage of French Jews who support the far right.
Bardella’s presence at the Israeli conference prompted a wave of other speakers to pull out of the event, including French-Jewish philosopher Bernard Henri-Levy and CEO of the US-based Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Jonathan Greenblatt.
“I find it hard to feel protected by a party whose leader still does not know whether (National Rally founder, the late) Jean-Marie Le Pen was antisemitic or not, and whose presidential candidate (Marine Le Pen) lumps the kippa and the Islamic veil together in the same category of opprobrium,” Henri-Levy wrote in an open letter to the Israeli president after he cancelled his planned speech at the conference.
“In light of some of the recently announced participants at the Israeli government’s antisemitism conference, Jonathan decided that he would no longer be attending the event,” an ADL spokesperson told CNN.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/middleeast/ballal-oscar-palestinian-beaten-israeli-settlers-intl-latam/index.html,Oscar-winning Palestinian director of ‘No Other Land’ released from Israeli detention after being assaulted,2025-03-24 21:10:02,"The Palestinian co-director of Oscar-winning film “No Other Land” Hamdan Ballal was beaten up by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, taken away by Israeli soldiers and detained overnight, according to his family, friends, colleagues, eyewitnesses and lawyer.
On Tuesday afternoon, following his release from detention, Ballal’s lawyer Leah Tzemel said that he had been “arbitrarily” held in police detention in Kiryat Arba’a, an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, and that he had been beaten in custody by Israeli soldiers. Following his release, he was moved to a hospital in Hebron, where he was treated for his injuries, according to his brother, Nimer.
Despite suffering from dehydration and bruising, Ballal left the hospital, his co-director Basel Adra told CNN. He has now returned home to his family in Susya in the occupied West Bank, his brother said.
CNN has reached out to Israeli authorities for comment on the allegations.
Speaking through tears from inside her home in the village of Susya on Tuesday afternoon, Ballal’s wife Lamya told CNN that her husband was attacked in front of their house by three settlers shortly after Iftar, the sundown breaking of the fast during Ramadan.
Ballal had seen a group of settlers who were attacking the village, she said, but when he tried to document them, they came after him.
The men beat Ballal with brass knuckles and with the butt of a rifle to his head, she said, while a mob of other settlers threw stones at the door and “tried to penetrate into the house from the windows,” where she and her terrified three children were sheltering.
Adra told CNN that he had gone to Ballal’s home on Monday evening after Ballal called him in distress. He arrived to see Ballal and at least one other person being taken away.
Adra added that a group of masked Israeli settlers, Israeli police and the military were also outside the home, with Israeli soldiers firing at anyone who tried to get close. CNN saw a bullet casing on the ground on Tuesday, just steps from Ballal’s front door.
The Israeli military said it had arrived at the scene of a “violent confrontation” between Palestinians and Israelis who were throwing rocks at each other. It said the fight had broken out after several “terrorists hurled rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles.”
Three Palestinians and an Israeli were then taken in for questioning after “several terrorists” threw rocks at the security forces, it said.
Yuval Abraham, another co-director of the film, who is Israeli and was not at the scene at the time of the incident, said Ballal had sustained injuries to his head and abdomen.
Najah Mughanam, Ballal’s neighbor, told CNN that she and her husband, both sheep farmers in their 60s, were also attacked by the settlers.
“They beat up my husband with a shovel,” she said, adding that it was the second time in a week that the settlers had come to attack them on their land. On Monday, in addition to trying to steal their sheep, their water tank was also slashed with a knife.
Mughanam said that since the war began, settler violence in her village had increased. “Since October 7, there have been more than 45 attacks on us, here in Susya,” she said.
‘There’s no accountability’
Five American activists from the Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV) who were also at the scene on Monday said they too had been assaulted by Israeli settlers. They said more than a dozen settlers had attacked the village, wielding batons, knives and at least one assault rifle, following a dispute involving an Israeli settler who was shepherding near a Palestinian home.
Jenna, an activist who asked to be identified by her first name only for fear of retaliation, said she and her colleagues were attacked by around 20 masked settlers when they approached Susya that night. Her group did not witness Ballal’s arrest.
“We tried to retreat to the car, and they hit me with sticks,” she told CNN, adding that the settlers smashed several of the car’s windows and slashed a tire. Video from the car’s dash camera shared by CJNV shows a masked individual throwing a rock directly at the windshield, and photos show broken glass littering its interior.
Josh Kimelman, a Jewish American whose father is Israeli, was in the same group. He told CNN that Israeli soldiers witnessed the incident but did nothing to prevent it.
“We told them that they attacked us,” Kimelman said. “They said everything will be fine and then stood by us and didn’t follow the settlers.”
Kimelman said that similar attacks happen frequently, but they don’t always get as much attention as they should. “They don’t always involve an Oscar-winning filmmaker,” he said.
“There’s no accountability for settlers who commit violence,” he added.
Earlier this month, Ballal, Adra and Abraham had all stood alongside each other to accept the Oscar for best documentary. The joint Israeli-Palestinian team’s film recounts the eviction of Palestinians from their homes in the occupied West Bank.
Ballal, a Palestinian farmer, has previously been subject to intimidation and threats by Israeli settlers. He recounted to CNN last year how settlers put their livestock on his land while he was asleep. He told CNN’s Nic Robertson the settlers planned to take his land and farm and that their aggression intensified after the deadly Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023.
Ballal had documented his interactions with settlers, including threats of violence from a settler who claimed God had given him Ballal’s land.
Ballal said he called the police but to no avail.
“No Other Land” documents the continued demolition by Israeli authorities of Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in the Hebron mountains of the West Bank where Adra lives with his family. The documentary highlights the Israeli government’s efforts to evict the villagers by force, with viewers seeing the local playground being torn down, the killing of Adra’s brother by Israeli soldiers, and other attacks by Jewish settlers while the community tries to survive.
Ballal’s wife Lamya told CNN that after the Oscar win, settler aggression toward Ballal grew.
“Because he has brought our (suffering) to the entire world and shown what the settlers are doing to us, they want to get revenge on him because the entire world knows what is going on, what the settlers are doing to us,” Lamya said.
Israel settler violence has continued to ravage Palestinian villages in the West Bank. The number of herding outposts – established by Israeli settlers to mark their claim – has expanded by nearly 50% since the war broke out, according to a joint report shared with CNN by Peace Now and Kerem Navot, two Israeli advocacy groups that oppose settlements and track their development, covering data up to the end of December 2024.

Video obtained by CNN showed large crowds, estimated to be thousands of people by a CNN journalist on the ground, marching through the streets of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, chanting “For god’s sake, Hamas out,” “Hamas terrorists” and “We want an end to the war.”
A message shared on social media appeared to call for nine anti-Hamas demonstrations across Gaza on Wednesday, with the protest organizers saying, “our voices must reach all the spies who sold our blood.”
“Let them hear your voice, let them know that Gaza is not silent, and that there is a people who will not accept to be eradicated,” the message continued.
CNN has not been able to verify the original source of the message.
The protests come after the death toll in Gaza surpassed 50,000 on Sunday, according to the health ministry in the enclave, with no end in sight.
The territory, home to 2.1 million Palestinians, fell under the militant group’s control in 2007 after a 2006 election and brief civil war with Fatah, a rival Palestinian faction that is the backbone of the Palestinian Authority.
Northern Gaza has been hit hard by the military offensive Israel launched in response to the October 7 attacks. Seventeen months of war have reduced much of the enclave to rubble, making it impossible for aid agencies to reach the battered north.
The crisis in the enclave, which relies almost exclusively on humanitarian aid, was compounded when Israel said it was halting all aid from entering Gaza at the start of March, following the breakdown of talks to extend a ceasefire.
Israel has often accused Hamas of stealing humanitarian aid delivered to the enclave to “rebuild its war machine,” something the militant group denies.
The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said Sunday that no food, water, medicines, or fuel had entered Gaza in three weeks, marking a longer siege than what was in place in the first phase of the war.
“Every day without food inches Gaza closer to an acute hunger crisis,” UNRWA said in a social media post on Sunday.","['Abeer Salman', 'Caitlin Danaher']",en

The ministry on Sunday reported 41 more deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the toll to 50,021.
Authorities in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters when reporting casualty figures, but the health ministry and the United Nations say the majority of deaths are women and children. And the true toll could be much higher, with many thousands believed to still be under the rubble.
On Monday, the ministry published a list of names of 15,613 children under the age of 18 who it said had been killed in Israeli military operations in Gaza. Among them, 890 children were under the age of 1, and 274 were born and died during the war. Almost a quarter, 26%, were under the age of 5.
The Israeli military told CNN that the Hamas-controlled ministry’s figures are “replete with inconsistencies and false determinations,” adding that the ministry tends to “record deaths unrelated to the conflict, such as natural deaths.”
The Israel Defense Forces added that it is “committed to mitigating civilian harm during operational activity in strict accordance to international law,” and that it “distinguishes between civilians and combatants as required by its legal obligations and entrenched values.”
The death toll surged as Israel resumed its war with Hamas last week, ending a two-month ceasefire in Gaza. Tuesday’s renewed airstrikes made it one of the deadliest days for Palestinians since the war began, with more than 400 killed by Israeli fire, according to the health ministry. By Wednesday, Israel had also resumed its ground operation in the enclave.
Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza on October 7, 2023, following the militant group’s surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Hamas called the latest offensive a “new and dangerous breach” of the ceasefire agreement. The militant group says it is committed to the ceasefire agreement it signed with Israel in January, but on Thursday fired its first rockets at Israel since the truce collapsed.
Gazans are left with little hope that the killing will slow as Israeli officials warn that what’s to come will be significantly worse.
Defense Minister Israel Katz last week warned Hamas that Israel will maintain a permanent presence in parts of Gaza unless the hostages in Gaza are released.
Katz said Friday that he’d instructed the Israeli military “to seize additional areas in Gaza, while evacuating the population, and to expand the security zones around Gaza in order to protect Israeli communities and IDF soldiers through permanent maintenance of the territory by Israel.”
Soon after the renewed campaign began, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: “I want to assure you: This is just the beginning.”
Almost all of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million has been displaced from their homes. The enclave’s healthcare system has been severely damaged, with hospitals often becoming the center of fighting. A humanitarian crisis and famine in parts of Gaza are unfolding, as Israel blocked aid from entering Gaza earlier this month and as its latest operation impedes distribution. And the UN on Monday said it would reduce its presence in Gaza – but not leave the enclave entirely – amid the renewed attacks including one on a UN compound that killed a UN worker last week and severely injured six others.
Negotiations to extend the ceasefire have been moribund nearly from the day it went into effect January 19. Hamas has insisted on sticking to the initial framework signed with Israel in January, which would have seen parties move to a second phase on March 1. Under the terms of the second phase, Israel would have had to withdraw entirely from Gaza and commit to a permanent end of the war. In exchange, Hamas would release all living hostages.
The second phase never happened, and Israel resumed the war, citing Hamas’ alleged rejection of “two concrete mediation proposals presented by the US” and its “threats to harm IDF soldiers and Israeli communities” as justification for its attacks on Gaza.
Israel does not dispute that a significant number of Palestinian civilians have been killed in its war in Gaza. It has however long argued that the health ministry’s figures are exaggerated, and that Hamas embeds itself between civilians, using them as “human shields.”
The United Nations and United States State Department have repeatedly said they believe the health ministry’s figures to be accurate, and independent academic studies have estimated that the true toll is likely to be far higher.
CNN cannot independently verify the numbers and the Israeli government does not allow foreign journalists to independently enter Gaza.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/middleeast/israel-gaza-ground-offensive-intl/index.html,Israel considers massive new ground offensive in Gaza as it ramps up pressure on Hamas,2025-03-24 14:08:26,"Israel is making plans for a potential major ground offensive in Gaza that would involve sending tens of thousands of troops into combat to clear and occupy large swaths of the enclave, an Israeli official and a second source familiar with the matter said.
The potential large-scale offensive is one of several possible scenarios the Israeli government is contemplating as it escalates its attacks on Gaza and seeks to pressure Hamas to release more hostages without negotiating an end to the war.
Efforts by Egypt and Qatar to revive the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have intensified in recent days and one source said leaks about a major ground offensive are part of an Israeli effort to apply more pressure on Hamas at the negotiating table. Israeli officials have previously indicated that Israel would stop its attacks if Hamas agrees to free more hostages.
Still, the Israeli military, led by its new and more aggressive chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, has been crafting plans for a large-scale operation in Gaza for weeks now.
“If there are not renewed hostage negotiations then the only alternative left is to resume the fighting,” Eyal Hulata, former head of Israel’s National Security Council, told CNN. “And there are serious plans.”
While the Israeli military has launched numerous ground offensives in Gaza over the course of the war, its forces often withdrew within days or weeks of routing Hamas fighters in the targeted area. Without an Israeli troop presence or an alternative governing or military force, Hamas would often re-emerge in those areas, prompting Israeli forces to return.
Under one potential scenario now being considered, Israeli forces would clear Hamas from large swaths of Gaza and then occupy that territory to prevent Hamas’s resurgence, the sources said. Such a decision could see the Israeli military occupying the territory and fighting insurgencies for years.
A large-scale offensive could involve five Israeli divisions — or some 50,000 troops — the sources said.
The government is escalating the pressure “to bring Hamas back to the table on Israel’s terms,” Israel Ziv – a retired general who served 35 years in the Israeli military, including as chief of operations in the joint chiefs of staff – told CNN.
“But of course the problem is that once you escalate you can find yourself at the end of the road, in the depth of swamp. And this is the risk that no one knows if it will work or not.”
“Once you threaten something you should be prepared to do it,” he said.
The Israeli military has already begun laying the groundwork for larger-scale ground maneuvers, recapturing half of the Israeli-demarcated Netzarim corridor, which splits northern Gaza from the rest of the strip, and pushing troops into strategic locations in northern and southern Gaza.
Israel’s cabinet on Sunday set up an agency to facilitate any Palestinians in Gaza who wished to participate in a “voluntary transfer” to third countries – though none have agreed to take in emigrees.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made eliminating Hamas’s military and governance capabilities in Gaza a central war goal as he vows to achieve “absolute victory.”
But a larger-scale and longer-term Israeli military offensive in Gaza could also draw stiff resistance from the Israeli public, of which a majority has been clamoring for a deal to free the 59 hostages still held in Gaza over a return to war.
“What we will see is a permanent presence of the IDF fighting the counter-insurgency on the ground,” Hulata said. “And there will be no other option than for the IDF to assume responsibility for the humanitarian aid.”
Israel has since the beginning of March blocked all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, amplifying the humanitarian catastrophe in the strip.
Further occupation of Gaza “is, at least right now, not in the interest of Israel,” Ziv said. “For some of the extremists in the government like (Bezalel) Smotrich” – the far-right finance minister – “maybe it’s the purpose. But it’s definitely not the best of the Israeli policy at this time.”
Before Israel ended the ceasefire last week, a March 9 poll from the Israel Democracy Institute found that nearly three-quarters of Israelis supported reaching a deal to end the war with Hamas in exchange for the release of all the hostages.
And recently released hostages and the families of current hostages have warned that resuming the war in Gaza will only serve to endanger the lives of the 24 hostages estimated to still be alive.
Netanyahu’s political priorities may lie elsewhere, however. Key members of his right-wing governing coalition have been clamoring for a return to full-scale war over a negotiated settlement to free the hostages.
And Netanyahu’s aides believe US President Donald Trump will be more supportive of large-scale Israeli military action than former President Joe Biden, who suspended the transfer of certain weapons in order to forestall a major Israeli offensive into the heavily populated southern part of Gaza.
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has hinted at the possibility of large-scale expansion of military ground operations, saying last week he had “instructed the IDF to seize additional territories, while evacuating the population.”
“The more Hamas continues its refusal, the more territory it will lose to Israel,” he said Friday in a statement.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Mick Krever']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/middleeast/israel-approves-proposal-to-facilitate-emigration-of-palestinians-from-gaza-intl/index.html,Israel approves controversial proposal to facilitate emigration of Palestinians from Gaza,2025-03-24 13:04:32,"Israel’s security cabinet has approved a controversial proposal to facilitate Palestinian emigration from Gaza, a move critics warn could amount to ethnic cleansing.
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Sunday said the security cabinet approved the proposal by Defense Minister Israel Katz to organize “a voluntary transfer for Gaza residents who express interest in moving to third countries, in accordance with Israeli and international law, and following the vision of US President Donald Trump.”
The decision marks a remarkable endorsement of a plan once considered a far-right fantasy – and comes despite the prime minister’s earlier pledge not to permanently displace Gaza’s civilian population.
Critics have said that any mass displacement of Gazans in the midst of a devastating war would amount to ethnic cleansing, an act associated with war crimes and crimes against humanity under international law. Israeli officials have countered that emigration would be voluntary and in line with international legal standards.
But aid groups argue that Israel’s war has made life in Gaza nearly impossible. Martin Griffiths, the United Nations’ top emergency relief official, has called the enclave “uninhabitable,” saying its people are “witnessing daily threats to their very existence.”
The Israeli approval would establish an administration within the defense ministry “to prepare and facilitate the safe and controlled movement of Gaza residents who wish to voluntarily move to third countries,” according to a statement from the defense ministry.
Its work would include “establishing movement routes, pedestrian checks at designated crossings in the Gaza Strip,” and infrastructure to enable people to leave.
Israeli officials have presented the plan as a fulfillment of a desire by Trump to take over Gaza, expel its Palestinian population to neighboring countries and turn it into a Middle Eastern “riviera.”
The Palestinian Authority’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen told CNN’s Becky Anderson last month that Palestinians “are steadfast to stay in their land and will not move.”
Trump’s ‘vision’
Katz said Sunday that Israel is using “all means to implement the vision of the US president,” according to the defense ministry statement.
This month, Trump appeared to backtrack on his comments about displacing Palestinians, telling reporters that “nobody is expelling any Palestinians.” Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, said last month that the US initiative to rebuild Gaza won’t necessarily amount to an “eviction plan” and that it was designed to “shake up everybody’s thinking.”
Last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had no intention to displace Palestinians or occupy Gaza.
“I want to make a few points absolutely clear: Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population,” Netanyahu said in a video statement in January 2024.
Trump’s proposal has, however, brought the idea further into the mainstream, with Israeli politicians now openly discussing mass emigration of Gazans as a solution to the war. And Katz last week said that Israel may maintain a permanent presence in the enclave.
Israeli rights group Peace Now criticized the plan, saying “the establishment of the administration to expel Palestinians from Gaza is one of the stupidest moves by a government that has lost all direction and logical thinking.”
The prospect has also drawn sharp rebuke from Arab leaders, especially Egypt and Jordan, who would be expected to absorb the large number of expelled Palestinians. Experts have also warned that displacing Palestinians would further destabilize the region and threaten the security of neighboring states.
Smotrich said Sunday that the security cabinet also approved the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, noting that 13 areas in the West Bank would be split from existing settlements and would be recognized as independent settlements.
“Instead of hiding and apologizing – we are raising the flag, building, and settling. This is another important step on the path to actual sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the name by which Israelis refer to the West Bank.
The Yesha Council, an umbrella body representing Jewish settlements, said that as of January 2024, there were 150 settlements in the West Bank.
It said that the decision exposes a “long-standing lie that (Israel) does not establish new settlements, but only ‘neighborhoods’ of existing settlements” and that it is “another nail in the coffin that the Government of Israel is preparing for the only chance for a future of peace and security.”
A statement sent by Smotrich’s office said the move comes against “the backdrop of the approval of tens of thousands of housing units in Judea and Samaria and represents another significant step in the process of normalizing and regulating the settlement.”
Smotrich and other right-wing ministers have been pushing an aggressive expansion of settlements on the path to declaring Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, which would be in defiance of international law and UN Security Council resolutions.",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

But Greenberg is not a soldier, and the desert camouflage fatigues are the only military uniform the so-called refusenik - as conscientious objectors are called in Israel - has ever worn.
Greenberg has been in and out of prison for the last year, serving a total of 197 days over five consecutive sentences. Earlier this month, Greenberg was released from the Neve Tzedek prison for the last time.
His crime? Refusing to enlist after being summoned for military service, which is compulsory for most Jewish Israelis - and some minorities - over the age of 18.
Greenberg said his refusal to serve came as the “culmination of a long process of learning and moral reckoning.”
“The more I learned, the more I knew I couldn’t wear a uniform that symbolizes killing and oppression,” he said, explaining that Israel’s war in Gaza - which was launched after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023 - solidified his decision to refuse.
“There is genocide,” he said. “So we don’t need good reasons (to refuse).”
The Israeli government has vehemently denied accusations that the war in Gaza amounts to genocide against the Palestinian people.
The war, which was reignited last week when Israel resumed airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza after a short-lived ceasefire, has killed over 50,000 Palestinians in 17 months, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
Over 670 people have been killed and 1,200 others injured in Gaza since Tuesday alone, when Israel’s military campaign restarted, according to the health ministry there.
“I want this change, and I will give my life for it,” Greenberg said of his decision to serve time in prison rather than serving with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
It’s a decision that conscientious objectors like Greenberg don’t take lightly, as refusing the draft is essentially a choice of ostracization.
In Israel, the military is more than just an institution. It’s part of the social fabric, with military service and secular Jewish-Israeli identity deeply intertwined. And it starts early: From elementary school, students are taught they will one day be the soldiers who will protect children just like them, with soldiers visiting classrooms and schools explicitly encouraging students to enlist. At 16, those children receive their first recruitment orders, culminating with conscription at 18. Many see it as an honor, a duty and a rite of passage.
Greenberg has been called a self-hating Jew, antisemitic, a terrorist supporter, and a traitor, he said – even by family and friends.
“People message me on Instagram and say that they will slaughter me, as Hamas did to Israelis on October 7,” he said.
In prison, Greenberg was placed in solitary confinement after receiving threats from fellow inmates – a move that prison officials told him was “for his safety.”
Despite social ostracization, he – and what a network of organizations supporting conscientious objectors say is a growing number of refuseniks – remain dedicated to the cause.
Their numbers are still exceedingly small. Only a dozen Israeli teens have publicly refused to enlist on conscientious grounds since the start of the war, according to Mesarvot, an organization that supports objectors. But that number is higher than in years prior to the war.
Mesarvot told CNN that there are far more “grey refuseniks” or, people that claim mental or general health exemptions to dodge the draft and avoid the possibility of serving time behind bars. Because of the nature of those refusals, it is impossible to provide exact numbers.
Yesh Gvul, another anti-war group that supports conscientious objectors, told CNN that on average, every year, 20% of youngsters required to serve are refusing to do so, according to figures shared by the Israeli military. That number, Yesh Gvul said, includes both refuseniks and “grey refuseniks.”
The Israeli military does not publish figures about conscription refusal. CNN has asked the Israeli military for those figures and comment.
Other groups have been far more vocal than the refuseniks in refusing to take part in Israel’s military tradition. Before the October 7 attacks, thousands of reservists protesting the government’s desire to weaken the judiciary said that they would not show up for service. And for months, the country has been roiled over the conscription of ultra-orthodox men who refuse to enter the military because they are studying in religious schools.
Greenberg’s views are extreme even for the increasingly marginalized Israeli left. The mass protests that have become commonplace since October 7 are not so much against the military or war writ large, but in favor of a ceasefire deal to bring home hostages held in Gaza. But Greenberg and other refuseniks hope that their movement might create space for a more mainstream dialogue on the pitfalls of a militarized society.
“If I join the army, I just will be part of the problem. I personally prefer to be part of the solution,” Greenberg said, noting that he may not live to see it.
On Saturday, around a dozen of those refuseniks met at the headquarters of the left-wing political coalition Hadash to prepare for their weekly demonstration in central Tel Aviv.
Smoking a roll-up cigarette on the balcony of the building with a handful of other conscientious objectors, Lior Fogel, a 19-year-old from Tel Aviv, said she had always had “issues with the army as an institution, based on violence and force,” and managed to get a psychiatrist to sign her off with a mental health condition to get out of service.
She told CNN that it was only after she received her exemption from the army that she began to understand the role that the military plays in the systemic everyday violence of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories. That injustice, she said, drives her activism today.
Multiple human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have said that Israel’s treatment of Palestinians constitutes apartheid. Israel has denounced that characterization as antisemitic.
“The system of apartheid and the maintenance of this rule that actively oppresses another group cannot be upheld. Not only is it immoral and generally horrible, but it will end up blowing up in your face,” Fogel said.
As Fogel and the others marched to Begin Street to join thousands of people from all walks of society who were demonstrating under an umbrella of pro-democracy and anti-war, she too, acknowledged that the views of the refuseniks remain fringe.
Still, the activists might be meeting their moment.
Rage against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached a fever pitch this week among tens of thousands of protesters who believe he is employing increasingly anti-democratic means to stay in power, and who question what he hopes to achieve with a renewed military campaign that nearly a year and a half of relentless war has not.
Many blame Netanyahu for prioritizing his political survival over the security of his country and say the renewed military campaign grossly endangers the lives of the estimated 24 living hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas and its allies.
The sentiment marks a significant turn in the conflict, and one that refuseniks hope will give Israelis that are considering refusing to serve in protest of the renewed military campaign the power to act - regardless of political persuasion.
“When Israel restarted the fight, a lot of people, not radical or left, but people that support the ceasefire and the hostages can now say, we will refuse – even if they don’t care about the Palestinians,” Greenberg said.
“The refusal is now less taboo. So, they can use this tool that we developed - even though they think that we are crazy and traitors - when they think it’s right,” he added.
Another refusenik at the demonstration, Iddo Elam, 18, who served time in prison for his refusal, told CNN: “I would prefer this over killing children.” According to UNICEF, more than 14,500 children have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war.
Elam said he was hoping his protest would help fellow Israelis to understand that “the pain of Palestinians is the same as Israelis.”
When another attendee of the wider protest heard Elam talking, he interrupted to insist that the teenager’s viewpoint isn’t representative of Israeli society, and said: “That’s not true. He is a minority, and his views don’t represent what everybody else here thinks.”
But others stood by in support of dozens of objectors who chanted “peace, equality, social justice,” and held signs that read “refuse the war, mobilize for peace.”
Rakefet Lapid, whose two children also refused service years before the war, and whose family lives in one of the kibbutz that was attacked by Hamas on October 7 said: “I’m glad they are still some young people willing to say that.”
“But I’m sorry they are a small minority,” she added.
Greenberg said he chose to go public because he “didn’t want to lie.”
But one 16-year-old who asked not to be named, told CNN that while he knows he will refuse the draft when his time comes, he is still deciding how.
While the teen has secured papers from a psychiatrist that say he has mental issues that won’t allow him to serve, he said his reason is not due to his mental health – but his political perspective.
“If I’m going out on my ‘mental issues,’ then it’s like saying to the army: ‘I am the problem, not you,’” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/23/middleeast/israel-intensifies-southern-gaza-offensive-intl/index.html,Israel strikes southern Gaza hospital as it targets Hamas operative in escalation of renewed offensive,2025-03-23 00:00:00,"An Israeli airstrike hit a hospital in southern Gaza on Sunday night, leaving a part of the hospital in flames and causing multiple casualties, two doctors working at Nasser Medical Complex told CNN, as the country pressed a renewed offensive in the embattled enclave.
The Israeli military confirmed it carried out a strike on a “key terrorist in the Hamas terrorist organization who was operating inside” the hospital but did not share the target’s identity.
Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV reported that Ismail Barhoum, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, and his nephew Ibrahim were killed in the strike on Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.
Barhoum was receiving medical treatment for injuries sustained during an Israeli strike on March 18, according to Al-Aqsa TV. Hamas later confirmed Barhoum’s death which it said illustrates Israel’s “disregard for all international norms and agreements.”
Hospitals are entitled to special protections during armed conflict under international humanitarian law and can only be targeted under extremely limited circumstances, such as if they are being used to actively commit “an act harmful to the enemy,” according to the Geneva Conventions.
The strike comes after Israeli operations intensified in southern Gaza, with the military saying earlier on Sunday that it had encircled an entire district and ordered evacuations.
The Israeli military resumed air and ground operations in Gaza earlier this week, blamed on Hamas for refusing to agree to revised terms on extending the first phase of the ceasefire. Gaza health officials meanwhile said the toll from the fighting since October 7 has passed 50,000.
Nasser Medical Complex, the largest functioning hospital in Gaza, has previously seen intense bombardment and raids from Israeli forces accusing the facility of harboring Hamas operatives.
On Sunday, the second floor of the hospital was struck, Dr. Tanya Haj Hassan, a pediatrician from Medical Aid for Palestinians, told CNN following the attack.
The strike hit the men’s surgical unit, resulting in multiple casualties, according to Dr. Mark Perlmutter, an American doctor currently in Gaza. He said European and American teams were working at the hospital when the airstrike hit.
Images of the aftermath show a fire burning and smoke billowing as crowds gathered on the streets outside of the hospital.
A video shared with CNN by Dr. Perlmutter shows the interior of the hospital after the strike. Dazed individuals are seen walking among debris in a hallway, with smoke in the air and power knocked out.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza blamed Israel for the strike, saying “occupation forces have just targeted the surgical building inside Nasser Medical Complex, which houses many patients and injured individuals, resulting in a large fire at the location.”
The Israeli military on Sunday accused Hamas of exploiting “civilian infrastructure while brutally endangering the Gazan population” and vowed to “continue to operate against the Hamas terrorist organization and to remove any threat to Israeli civilians.”
Encircled district
The Israeli military said Sunday that troops had concluded the encirclement of Tel al-Sultan, a district to the west of Rafah that has seen multiple Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations in the past year, a testament to the difficulties of dislodging Hamas.
The purpose of the operation was to “reinforce control and expand the security zone in southern Gaza,” the IDF said in a statement Sunday.
“During the night, the troops encircled the area, eliminated several terrorists, and conducted a targeted raid on a terror infrastructure site that was used over the past few months as a command and control center of Hamas terrorists,” the IDF said.
The military earlier issued a warning to people to leave the Tel al-Sultan area immediately as troops launched their offensive.
The IDF instructed civilians to move north to the Mawasi area, but would not permit movement in vehicles, forcing those evacuating to do so by foot.
The Israeli military forcibly displaced thousands of already displaced people from their tents in the Tel al-Sultan district under heavy gunfire, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank said in a post on social media.
Gaza’s Civil Defense warned of a “grave and imminent danger threatening the lives of more than 50,000 civilians” in the Al-Baraksat area, west of Rafah, after they were “besieged by Israeli occupation forces.”
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said four of its ambulances had been surrounded after responding to an Israeli attack in Rafah. Contact had been lost with a civil defense crew west of Rafah that was trying to rescue an ambulance crew.
Also in the south, Hamas-affiliated media reported that three people had been killed when a municipal vehicle in Khan Younis was struck.
Hamas said Salah al-Bardawil, a member of the group’s political bureau, was killed along with his wife in an Israeli strike on tents for the displaced in the area.
Israel blocked aid going into Gaza ahead of its renewed operations, in an attempt to force Hamas to accept the new terms and release the hostages it is still holding.
The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said no food, water, medicines or fuel have entered Gaza in three weeks, marking a longer siege than what was in place in the first phase of the war. “Every day without food inches Gaza closer to an acute hunger crisis,” UNRWA said in a social media post on Sunday.
The IDF is also continuing its ground operations in northern Gaza. It said on Saturday that troops had begun operating in the Beit Hanoun area “to target Hamas’ terror infrastructure sites in order to expand the security zone in northern Gaza.”
It added that fighter jets struck several Hamas targets.
On Sunday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said that 41 more deaths in the past 24 hours as the death toll in Gaza surpassed 50,000, marking a grim milestone for a war with no end in sight.
The ministry said that 50,021 people have been killed in Gaza since the October 7 attacks in its latest update.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/22/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attacks-ceasefire-intl/index.html,Israel strikes Hezbollah in response to rocket fire in most significant flare-up of tensions since ceasefire,2025-03-22 10:39:20,"Israel’s military carried out multiple waves of deadly airstrikes across Lebanon targeting suspected Hezbollah sites on Saturday, as tensions flare again in the region.
At least seven people have been killed, including a child, and 40 others injured in Saturday’s strikes, the Lebanese Health Ministry said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered a “second wave” of attacks on southern and eastern Lebanon on Saturday evening local time in response to Hezbollah rocket fire toward Israel and “in continuation of the first wave of attacks this morning,” according to a statement released by the prime minister’s office.
“The Lebanese government is responsible for everything that happens on its territory,” the statement added.
The day’s barrages mark the most significant eruption of violence between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah since a ceasefire brought uneasy calm to the border.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its latest strikes targeted “Hezbollah command centers, infrastructure sites, terrorists, rocket launchers, and a weapons storage facility.” It said it was responding to at least five projectiles fired from within Lebanon toward Israel; three were intercepted by the Israeli air force and two did not cross the border.
“We promised security to the Galilee communities - and that is exactly what will happen,” Katz said in a statement Saturday, referring to inhabitants of northern Israel.
Hezbollah has denied any involvement, saying it was committed to the truce, and accused Israel of using the rocket fire as a “pretext” to attack Lebanon.
The Lebanese military, which is investigating the incident, said it had found and dismantled “three primitive rocket launchers in the area north of the Litani River.”
Lebanon’s presidency has condemned “attempts to drag once again into a cycle of violence,” saying President Joseph Aoun had instructed the army to protect the country’s citizens, as well as probing the rocket attacks.
A shaky truce
Before the truce, Israel and Hezbollah exchanged cross-border attacks for 13 months in the wake of the Gaza conflict. Israel launched an intense ground and aerial campaign in September last year, decimating the militant group’s leadership.
Israel continues to maintain a military presence at five locations in the south of Lebanon, despite agreeing to withdraw as part of a ceasefire deal, struck in November last year.
The deal brought a significant reduction in more than a year of cross-border strikes and put an end to months of a full-scale war.
The last time Israel accused the Lebanese armed group of firing projectiles across the border was in early December.
The latest escalation comes after Israel restarted military operations in Gaza earlier in the week, putting an end to a fragile truce in the Palestinian enclave that had largely held since January.
Israeli fire has killed at least 634 people and injured more than 1,170 others in Gaza since the fighting resumed, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry.
On Sunday, Hamas political leader Salah al-Bardawil was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his tent in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, alongside his wife, the group said.
The UN’s peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said it was “alarmed” by the Saturday-morning escalation in cross-border violence, calling on all sides to “uphold their commitments.”
“We strongly urge all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, especially when civilian lives and the fragile stability observed in recent months are at risk,” it said in a statement.
“Any further escalation of this volatile situation could have serious consequences for the region.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/21/middleeast/hamas-weighs-latest-us-ceasefire-plan-intl/index.html,Israel says it will maintain ‘permanent’ presence in Gaza unless hostages are freed,2025-03-19 00:00:00,"Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has warned Hamas that Israel will maintain a permanent presence in parts of Gaza unless the hostages in Gaza are released as Israel escalates a new offensive in the territory.
The shaky ceasefire collapsed on Tuesday when Israel bombarded Gaza, shattering two months of calm that also saw dozens of hostages exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
Katz said Friday that he’d instructed the Israeli military “to seize additional areas in Gaza, while evacuating the population, and to expand the security zones around Gaza in order to protect Israeli communities and IDF soldiers through permanent maintenance of the territory by Israel.”
“The more Hamas continues its refusal to release the kidnapped, the more territory it will lose to Israel,” he added. It was unclear whether Katz meant the indefinite occupation of parts of Gaza.
Katz’ comments came as Hamas said it was continuing contacts with mediators to try to re-establish the ceasefire that was in effect between January 19 and Tuesday.
Katz said Israel was adhering to the proposal of President Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff for the release all the hostages, both living and dead, “in advance and in two stages with a ceasefire in between - without endangering Israeli security interests.”
In the meantime, Israel would intensify strikes from the air, sea and land, and “civilian means of pressure” would be adopted along with military pressure, “including evacuating the Gaza population to the south and implementing US President Trump’s voluntary transfer plan for Gaza residents.”
Hamas meanwhile says it is considering the latest US ceasefire plan for Gaza and remains “fully engaged” in the mediation process.
In a statement Friday, Hamas said it was continuing to deliberate on a proposal from Witkoff, who has suggested extending the first phase of the ceasefire-hostage deal through early April. It reiterated its demand for a permanent end to the war, saying it was exploring “various ideas on the table in a manner that aims to achieve a prisoner exchange deal that ensures the release of detainees, ends the war, and secures a withdrawal.”
The proposal from Witkoff last week would have secured the release of a handful of living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for the extension of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, CNN has reported. Of the 59 hostages still being held in Gaza, fewer than half are still believed to be alive.
Witkoff proposed the ceasefire extension would run until the end of Passover, extending the pause in fighting and renewing the entry of humanitarian aid through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday.
Hamas has insisted on sticking to a timeline previously agreed with Israel and the US that would move the warring parties into a second phase of the truce, in which Israel would commit to ending the war. But Israel has refused, saying it wants to extend the first phase instead.
Khaled Meshaal, a senior Hamas official, on Thursday accused Israel of using the Witkoff plan “to blackmail Hamas by retrieving the (hostages) from the first phase of the agreement without committing to the obligations of the second phase, which include a lasting calm and full withdrawal of the occupation from the Gaza Strip.”
Israeli fire has killed more than 500 people and injured nearly a thousand in Gaza since the fighting resumed, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Hamas fired rockets into Israel Thursday for the first time since the truce collapsed, but no casualties were reported.
At least nine senior Hamas members, including top government officials, are among those killed, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The dead include Essam al-Dalis, the Hamas head of government in Gaza; Mahmoud Abu-Watfa, the interior minister; and Ahmed Al-Hatta, the justice minister, according to the IDF.
After Friday’s rocket-fire, the IDF ordered the evacuation of neighborhoods in north-west Gaza, as “an early warning before a strike. Terrorist organizations are returning to and firing rockets from populated areas” the IDF posted on X in Arabic.
The United Nations children’s agency, UNICEF, said the reported number of children killed on Wednesday marked “one of the largest single-day child death toll in the last year.”
The Israeli military said Thursday that it began a ground operation in southern Gaza’s Rafah city. The city’s municipality reported Friday that more than 100 civilians had been killed under bombardment – most of them children and women. It said residents were being forcibly driven into the open, with no shelter or food.
Egypt, one of the key mediators in the conflict, has given a gloomy assessment of the chance of renewed negotiations.
Asked by CNN whether Israel appears to be willing to return to the negotiating table, Egyptian foreign ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf said: “It doesn’t, and I think it’s an isolationist policy and runs diametrically opposed to what the global community would like to see… an end to this war.”
Egypt had no indication that Israel was going to breach the Gaza ceasefire when Israeli negotiators were in Cairo on Sunday, just two days before Israel renewed attacks, Khallaf told CNN’s Becky Anderson in an interview on Thursday.
“We have not been receiving these indications. We were engaged in ceasefire talks in order to move forward with phase two and phase three,” he said, calling Israel’s return to war a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement “that will trigger ripple effects.”

Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel “is a state of law and according to the law, the Israeli government decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”
Other ministers immediately condemned the decision. Minister of Communications Shlomo Kari said the court had “no legal authority to interfere in this. That is the government’s authority and its alone. Your order is void.”
And far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich posted on X: “High Court judges will not conduct the war or determine its commanders. Period.”
In its ruling, the court said, “Petitions shall be scheduled for a hearing before the panel (of judges) as soon as possible and no later than April 8.” It added that in the meantime that it was issuing an order “suspending the effect of the decision.”
The vote to dismiss Bar in the early hours of Friday local time was appealed just hours later by Israel’s Supreme Court.
“The government has now unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposal to terminate the term of Shin Bet head Ronen Bar,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement Friday.
“Ronen Bar will end his role as Shin Bet head on April 10, 2025, or when a permanent Shin Bet head is appointed – whichever comes first,” it added.
That vote came after Netanyahu met with Bar last week and informed him that he would propose his removal.
In a video statement released on Sunday, Netanyahu said his “ongoing distrust” of Bar had led to the move. “At all times, but especially in such an existential war, the prime minister must have full confidence in the head of the Shin Bet,” Netanyahu said.
Netanyahu added that removing Bar would be necessary for achieving Israel’s war goals in Gaza and “preventing the next disaster.” The prime minister has frequently criticized the agency, placing blame on its leaders for the security lapses that led to the Hamas October 7, 2023, attacks that killed more than 1,200 people.
Shin Bet, which is in charge of monitoring domestic threats to Israel, conducted an internal investigation that determined that the agency had “failed in its mission” to prevent the attacks. But it also blamed policies enacted by Netanyahu’s government as contributing factors, such as politicians’ visits to the Al Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, “the treatment of prisoners, and the perception that Israeli society has been weakened due to the damage to social cohesion.”
An Israeli official told CNN on Thursday that the government had “lost all confidence in Ronen Bar, who continues to cling to his seat while cynically using the families of the hostages and politically improperly using his position to fabricate futile, unfounded investigations.”
Shin Bet is reported to have recently opened an investigation into allegations that members of Netanyahu’s office inappropriately lobbied on behalf of Qatar – something his office denies.
On Wednesday, the office of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara sent a letter to Netanyahu saying that the government could not fire Bar without the approval of a special committee.
Netanyahu responded with a letter on Thursday, saying Baharav-Miara was “exceeding her authority” and “giving legal opinions and instructions to the government in violation of Supreme Court rulings.”
Bar released a statement just hours before his dismissal saying the vote by Netanyahu’s cabinet “was hastily convened, contrary to every basic legal rule dealing with the right to be heard and contrary to the position of the legal adviser to the government.”
Netanyahu has previously removed both Bar and the head of the Mossad intelligence service, David Barnea, from the negotiating team engaging in indirect talks with Hamas regarding the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.
Opposition politicians have criticized Netanyahu’s targeting of Bar, claiming it is politically motivated.
“The dismissal of the head of the service at this time, at the initiative of the prime minister, sends a message to all those involved, a message that may jeopardize the optimal outcome of the investigation. This is a direct danger to the security of the state of Israel,” Bar said in his statement Thursday.","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Lauren Izso', 'Tim Lister', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq']",en

Israel resumed its offensive on Gaza on Tuesday, first bombarding the Strip with airstrikes before launching a ground offensive a day later. More than 500 people, including 200 children, have been killed since the new offensive began, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
Hamas fired three projectiles at central Israel, the Israeli military said. One was intercepted and two “fell into an open area,” with no casualties reported.
Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, confirmed it had launched an attack, saying it had “bombed the city of Tel Aviv deep inside the occupied territories with a barrage of M90 rockets” in retaliation for Israel’s attacks.
Israel also came under fire overnight from Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The Iran-back militia said it fired a ballistic missile at Israel in response to Israel’s renewed war in Gaza – the second it has fired since the ceasefire collapsed. Israel’s military said it intercepted the missile.
Israel blames the new fighting on Hamas for refusing to accept revised ceasefire terms. Hamas, in turn, has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of unilaterally upending the truce and putting hostages “at risk of an unknown fate.”
Netanyahu faced fury from protesters in Jerusalem on Wednesday as thousands gathered outside Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, to oppose the renewed fighting.
Protesters have accused Netanyahu of restarting the war in order to solidify his governing coalition, which has long threatened to collapse due to divisions over the war in Gaza.
Swiftly after Tuesday’s intense airstrikes, far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he would be returning to Netanyahu’s coalition. He had quit the government in January as Israel agreed to a ceasefire in Hamas.
At a National Security Ministry meeting on Thursday, Ben-Gvir said he was “happy to return after two months of respite.”
Ben-Gvir’s return to government will come as a boon to Netanyahu, who has to pass Israel’s next budget before a March 31 deadline or face fresh elections.
Israel continued to pound Gaza – killing at least 85 people since the early hours of Thursday, according to Palestinian officials – after it announced “targeted ground activities” on Wednesday.
Gaza’s health ministry said the toll was likely to rise with many people buried under rubble.
The Israeli military said it had retaken the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land that splits Gaza in half, dividing the central Gaza City and northern areas from the southern parts of the Strip that borders Egypt.
Israel launches more ground offensives
On Thursday, The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had launched another two ground offensives in Gaza, in the southern city of Rafah and in the north of the strip.
It said the operation in Rafah, at al-Shaboura refugee camp, had dismantled several “terrorist” infrastructure sites, while its action in the north took place along the coastal route in the area of Beit Lahia.
The ground operation in the north was preceded by Israeli strikes on the city of Beit Lahia the same morning, according to the IDF, which said it had targeted Hamas “infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch sites” there.
The Gaza Civil Defense said more than 50 people were killed in the strikes in Beit Lahia. One of the strikes targeted the home of the Abu Nasr family in the Al-Salatin neighborhood, killing 15 people, it added.
A resident of Beit Lahia, Mufida Abu Nasr, told CNN that that the strikes began in the early hours of Thursday morning as she was preparing suhoor, the pre-dawn meal Muslims consume before fasting during Ramadan.
“My children began to scream, and I was also terrified because I lost my son just 40 days ago; he was martyred,” she said. “When we went outside, we found that our relatives and neighbors had all been martyred.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/20/tech/wikipedia-adl-report-antisemitism-bias/index.html,The ADL says Wikipedia contains antisemitic bias - the latest move in a dispute over how the Israel-Gaza conflict is represented on the site,2025-03-20 13:00:52,"The Anti-Defamation League has found evidence of antisemitic and anti-Israel bias on Wikipedia, it said in a Tuesday report, marking the latest rift between the advocacy group and the world’s largest online encyclopedia over how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be portrayed on the site.
The ADL claims it identified a network of Wikipedia editors – volunteer moderators for the popular information websites – who appear to have coordinated to “circumvent Wikipedia’s policies to introduce antisemitic narratives, anti-Israel bias, and misleading information” in Israeli and Palestinian-related entries. The report also accuses Wikipedia of failing to enforce its neutrality policy.
But Wikipedia said the ADL’s report includes “unsupported and problematic claims,” according to a statement from a spokesperson for the Wikimedia Foundation, which manages the site.
“The Foundation takes seriously allegations of bias on Wikipedia,” the spokesperson said. “We categorically condemn antisemitism and all forms of hate. It is unfortunate that we were not asked by the report’s authors to provide information and context that might have helped allay some of the concerns raised.”
The report from the Jewish civil rights group comes amid broader tension among users and observers of the online encyclopedia over how the Israel-Hamas war should be covered on the site, with editors quarrelling over how to describe events related to the conflict. Wikipedia says it has already been working to fend off bad actors accused of manipulating the platform.
The dispute
Last year, Wikipedia editors labeled the ADL as “generally unreliable regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict” because of its dual role as an advocacy and research organization, but “generally reliable” on other topics. The ADL said at the time that the decision was “a sad development for research and education” and that it would prevent information on antisemitism from reaching the public.
Since that decision, “the ADL has continued to misrepresent Wikipedia’s well-established guidelines, policies, and enforcement mechanisms that effectively address the issues outlined in the report and its recommendations,” the Wikimedia Foundation said in its statement.
Separately, Wikipedia also confirmed that in January, it blocked eight editors from contributing to content related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over concerns about bad-faith edits, a move the ADL praised. Wikipedia’s Arbitration Committee, a group of volunteers elected by other editors to manage conduct on the site, also placed articles strictly about the conflict in “extended confirmed protection,” meaning they can only be edited by experienced volunteers.
It’s not the first time there have been dissenting opinions on how contentious issues should appear on the internet’s encyclopedia. Similar disagreements have flared over descriptions of Hong Kong’s relationship to China and the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Elon Musk also lashed out at the site earlier this year, calling it “Wokepedia” for its DEI budget and accusing it of political bias. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales responded that Musk must be “unhappy that Wikipedia is not for sale.”
The disputes align with concerns that have surfaced in recent years over the types of content and language that social media platforms do and don’t allow. But unlike many of those sites, Wikipedia is far more decentralized, relying on volunteer editors to create and edit articles while shaping and upholding its rules and norms, although the platform says it uses some automated moderation to police certain kinds of abuse.
“Wikipedia is written and managed by the people who show up,” said Loren Terveen, a computer science professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied Wikipedia and other online communities. “(Disputes) happen all the time … on various topics,” he said.
But the ADL says it worries antisemitic bias on the platform could be dangerous.
“We urge Wikipedia and policymakers to act quickly before rampant disinformation on one of the most visited sources of information leads to tragic consequences,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement regarding Tuesday’s report.
The report
According to the report, the ADL identified a group of 30 Wikipedia editors that it claims coordinated to change pages related to “Israel, Palestine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” It accuses the editors of “downplaying Palestinian antisemitism, violence and calls to destroy Israel while foregrounding criticism of Israel.” The editors also removed citations linking to reputable sources on those topics, such as academic research and mainstream media coverage, it said.
The ADL’s analysis compared three groups of 30 editors to the 30 editors who they say acted in “bad faith.” One group was comprised of active editors across all Wikipedia pages. Another focused on the topic of US-China relations, and the third engaged on the Israel-Hamas War page, but did not violate Wikipedia’s rules. The report found that the “bad faith” editors were far more active than the other three groups. Wikipedia says it has hundreds of thousands of volunteer editors.
The 30 editors collectively made changes to 10,000 articles related to Israel and Palestinians, with edits ramping up since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, according to the report.
For example, the report states that a “suspicious editor” removed references to mainstream media coverage about calls for the destruction of Israel from a page called “Palestinian political violence.” It also states that a media report referencing sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas during its October 7 attacks was removed from the main page about the group.
The ADL wrote that those and other edits suggest a “systematic effort to skew numerous Wikipedia entries to promote a set of narratives critical of Israel” and to “shift the entries from balanced historical accounts” to a slanted narrative.
The report also claims Arabic Wikipedia pages related to Hamas “glorify” the group, which is designated by the United States as a foreign terrorist organization, and “perpetuate pro-Hamas propaganda.” For example, the Arabic-language Wikipedia page for Hamas refers to the group’s “goals as ‘liberation’ of ‘Palestine’” and refers to suicide bombers as “martyrs,” according to the report, which says the site is failing to enforce its rules consistently across non-English language content.
Wikipedia’s policies say its editors should use a “neutral point of view,” meaning they should publish content that “almost everyone agrees about” but also make clear where there are points of contention. Editors who make major changes to articles should discuss them with others on the forum and provide a rationale first, the site says.
“The thing that you have to realize is that people are interpreting ‘neutral point of view,’” Terveen said. “And people are going to argue about that.”
In its statement, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation said the site has “multiple governance processes” to “prioritize a fair and balanced approach to contentious topics.”
“Wikipedia’s well-documented standards are specifically designed to prevent undue influence and preserve its independent, nonprofit model,” it said. “Wikipedia volunteers have a strong track record of successfully managing neutrality on contentious subjects.”
As part of a series of recommendations introduced in the report, the ADL is calling on the Wikimedia Foundation to develop a program that vets experts on Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to review contentious pages for accuracy and bias. It also wants Wikipedia to evaluate the effectiveness of its human review with its automated tools to prevent abuse and manipulation. The Wikimedia Foundation said many of the ADL’s suggestions are already in place on the site.
Terveen noted that it can be challenging for a site that relies on crowdsourced entries to reach a consensus view on controversial topics.
“The big problem is scale. Is there enough human effort to make sure things are done well? And that’s just an ongoing challenge,” Terveen said. “Wikipedia does a good job, but it doesn’t do a perfect job. And, I think, in some sense, it can’t do a perfect job.”",['Clare Duffy'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/middleeast/israel-ground-offensive-renewed-war-gaza-intl/index.html,Israeli strikes kill dozens as military launches first ground campaign since ceasefire collapsed,2025-03-18 00:00:00,"Israel pounded Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Palestinians, a day after launching a fresh ground campaign as part of its renewed assault on the territory that shattered the two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas.
At least 59 people died in the strikes, Gazan officials said, adding to the hundreds killed since Tuesday when Israel resumed bombing the strip.
Israel blames the new fighting on Hamas for refusing to accept revised ceasefire terms. Hamas, in turn, has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of unilaterally upending the truce and putting hostages “at risk of an unknown fate.”
As well as bringing brief calm to Gaza and allowing in vital aid, the ceasefire also saw dozens of hostages swapped for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
The Israeli military said Wednesday that it had launched “targeted ground activities” in Gaza, partially recapturing a key area in the territory.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops aimed to “expand the security zone and to create a partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza.”
“As part of the ground activities, the troops expanded their control further to the center of the Netzarim Corridor,” the military said, referring to a key Israeli-demarcated strip of land that splits Gaza in half, dividing the central Gaza City and northern Gaza from the southern parts of the strip that borders Egypt.
Hamas called the latest offensive a “new and dangerous breach” of the ceasefire agreement. The militant group, in a statement Wednesday, said it remained committed to the ceasefire agreement it signed with Israel in January.
Israel’s war in Gaza has killed nearly 50,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the enclave’s health ministry, and as the war resumes, the toll is mounting.
The Civil Defense also warned of an imminent famine, as Israel’s nearly three-week long blockade of humanitarian aid worsens the already dire conditions in the enclave.
Under January’s ceasefire deal, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim Corridor. Although Israel withdrew from the corridor, foreign military contractors have continued to man checkpoints between northern and southern Gaza.
After the truce became effective, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians filed through the corridor by foot, car and in some cases by donkeys, with many of them returning to homes that had been destroyed after 15 months of Israeli bombardment.
The Israeli military Thursday said it was banning Palestinians traveling on the main route between north and south Gaza.
Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday killed more than 400 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry, making it one of the war’s deadliest days.
Defense Minister Israel Katz warned on Wednesday that the residents of Gaza will “pay the full price” if Israeli hostages are not returned and Hamas remains able to govern in the strip.
An Israeli official said Tuesday that the airstrikes in Gaza were the first phase in a series of escalatory military actions aimed at pressuring Hamas into releasing more hostages, marking a return to Netanyahu’s view that military pressure is the most effective way to secure the release of hostages.
So far, the Israeli military has brought just eight living hostages back to Israel, out of 251 taken by Hamas and its allies on October 7, 2023. Most have been released as part of ceasefire deals in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
UN worker killed
On Wednesday, the United Nations said one of their international aid workers was killed by an “explosive ordnance” at the UN guesthouse in central Gaza, and five others were injured.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza blamed the attack on the Israeli military, which the IDF denied, saying it had not conducted an airstrike in the vicinity of the guesthouse.
Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), told reporters at a press conference in Brussels that the attack happened at a UN guesthouse in Deir al-Balah that was frequently used by UN staff.
The location was known to the IDF and in an isolated area with no other buildings nearby, he said. Da Silva said the guesthouse had come under attack multiple times this week. “Two days ago there was a near miss to this premises, and yesterday the premises was hit, and today there was another hit, unfortunately with these casualties,” he said.
“It cannot be categorized as an accident,” he added, stressing that “attacks on humanitarian premises are a breach of international law.”
A spokesperson for the Israeli foreign ministry said late Wednesday that a Bulgarian citizen working for the UN had died in Gaza, but it was not immediately clear if the Bulgarian was the same person mentioned in the UN’s statement.
Video filmed by CNN at the scene showed a hole on the side of the building.
Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member who reviewed the footage, said weapon fragments from the scene are consistent with the M339, an Israeli tank projectile.
Damage from the building is also consistent with a tank round, Ball said, and points to a pretty direct impact.
N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director at Armament Research Services (ARES) who also analyzed the footage, said the “remnants appear to be from an Israeli 120 mm tank projectile, most likely the M339 multi-purpose model.”
CNN asked the IDF whether they were investigating the possibility that the strike could have been caused by Israeli tank fire. A spokesperson said: “We have nothing to add at the moment. If new information arises, we will publish it.”
Fresh protest
Meanwhile, the renewed war drew thousands of protesters to Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem. Critics of Netanyahu’s government accuse the prime minister of using the war to shore up his shaky coalition.
Later on Wednesday, police clashed with demonstrators and arrested 12 people at an anti-Netanyahu rally in Jerusalem, they said in a statement. People were protesting the prime minister’s plan to fire the chief of the Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar.
Video from the scene shows a row of police officers face-to-face with a group of demonstrators. Police officers are seen pushing the protesters as they try to make them walk in a certain direction. Another image from the scene shows a police officer grabbing an elderly protester by the torso.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Israel Police said that they had deployed crowd-control measures after demonstrators “severely disrupted public order, including by setting fires in the middle of the roadway, creating a significant risk to fellow protesters.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/middleeast/israel-houthi-missile-yemen-intl-hnk/index.html,Israel intercepts missile launched by Houthi rebels as US airstrikes hit Yemen,2025-03-20 03:08:43,"Israel’s military intercepted a missile launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels early Thursday, the second to target Israel since the collapse of the Gaza ceasefire, as the United States’ intensifies airstrikes against the Iran-backed militant group.
The Houthis claimed responsibility for what it said was a ballistic missile fired in support of Palestinians and in response to Israel’s renewed bombardment of Gaza, which has killed almost 500 people in the strip since the fragile truce shattered on Tuesday.
Sirens sounded in several areas across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Israeli authorities said.
The missile was intercepted before it entered Israeli territory, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). No injuries were immediately reported, Israel’s emergency service said.
The Houthis said the missile targeted Ben Gurion International Airport, Israel’s main aviation hub on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.
The group also claimed to target the aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman and a number of US warships in the Red Sea with an unspecified number of ballistic and cruise missiles and drones.
The Houthis’ launch came after the latest US strikes targeted Yemen on Wednesday and early into Thursday, including in the capital Sanaa, as President Donald Trump threatened the Houthis in a post on his Truth Social platform, saying the rebel group “will be completely annihilated.”
The Houthis, whose drone and missile attacks on Red Sea shipping have significantly impacted global trade since late 2023, earlier said they will continue their assaults on American and Israeli interests until hostilities cease in Gaza. The group had paused its attacks when the ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas was declared in January.
Dozens of people have been reported killed in Yemen since Trump ordered “decisive” military action against the Houthis late last week.
On Wednesday, US strikes on Sanaa injured seven women and two children in a residential neighborhood, the Houthi-run health ministry said.
US strikes also targeted the western province of Al-Jawf on Wednesday and Hodeidah and Saada early Thursday, the Houthis said.
Video from Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV shows Yemeni civil defense teams extinguishing blazing fires in the aftermath of the strikes, damaged buildings and vehicles, and two children with blood on their bodies and clothes.
The US Central Command did not clarify specific locations it targeted in Yemen but confirmed Wednesday that its forces “continue 24/7 operations against the Iran-backed Houthis.”
US strikes over the weekend killed at least 53 people and wounded nearly 100 others in Yemen, including women and children, the Houthi-run health ministry said, according to Al-Masirah TV.
Middle East on edge
Israel’s return to war against Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza has heightened tensions in the Middle East, reigniting fears of a wider regional conflict.
As the US strikes hit Yemen, Trump warned Iran to stop sending military supplies to the Houthis “immediately.”
“Tremendous damage has been inflicted upon the Houthi barbarians, and watch how it will get progressively worse,” he said.
On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had launched a “targeted” ground offensive in Gaza, partially recapturing a key area in the territory, a day after launching an aerial bombardment of the strip that shattered the fragile two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas.
The operation included expanding Israeli control “further to the center of the Netzarim Corridor,” the military said. The corridor is a key strip of land that splits Gaza in half, dividing the central Gaza City and northern Gaza from the southern parts of the strip that borders Egypt.
Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday killed more than 400 people in Gaza, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry, making it one of the war’s deadliest days. Since then, dozens more Palestinians have been killed in strikes across the enclave.
The Civil Defense in Gaza has further warned of an imminent famine, as Israel’s nearly three-week long blockade of humanitarian aid worsens already dire conditions for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians.","['Lauren Izso', 'Kareem El Damanhoury', 'Helen Regan']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/20/middleeast/israel-west-bank-herding-outposts-intl-invs/index.html,"West Bank: Israeli outposts have proliferated since Oct. 7, new analysis shows",2025-03-05 00:00:00,"Jihad Suleiman Al-Sawafta, 46, has lived on his farm in the occupied West Bank village of Bardala his entire life. But when Israeli settlers showed up in December, Al-Sawafta said his land, and his livelihood, shrank to a fraction of its former self.
“The settlers brought another settler here and placed him in our area. The Israelis built a road that separates us from grazing and agricultural areas, and the settlers don’t allow us to farm on them,” he told CNN.
“They crowded the area. They took thousands of dunams (1,000 square meters) from Bardala and its grazing lands,” he said, referring to his Palestinian town in the northern part of the West Bank. He added that the Jordan Valley, a fertile strip of land long considered the West Bank’s breadbasket, had been “largely emptied”of its Palestinian residents.
Israeli forces were overseeing the paving of a new road during CNN’s visit in late January. Al-Sawafta said the military maintains a 24-hour presence, providing security for settlers, making it dangerous for him to cross and tend the crops he planted in nearby fields.
Responding to a request for comment about the situation in Bardala, the Israeli military told CNN that the status of the outpost had not changed, and that the new road was intended for security forces, paved in accordance with a military order. “Palestinians living in the area were not harmed during the work,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
Herding outposts like the one set up on Al-Sawafta’s land are often established by Israeli settlers on hilltops with a few caravans and sometimes livestock to mark their claim. Monitoring groups say they are notorious for swallowing up vast swathes of land and prohibiting Palestinian residents from moving freely. The outposts are illegal under both Israeli and international law, and the state is not allowed to finance or build on them.
The number of Israeli herding outposts has dramatically increased since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition took power in 2022 on a platform of settlement expansion. The government includes ministers who are themselves settlers and want to annex the occupied territory to Israel. In the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, which triggered Israel’s invasion of Gaza, settlers have accelerated land grabs with support from the state.
Israeli herding outposts have ballooned by nearly 50% since the war broke out, according to a joint report shared exclusively with CNN by Peace Now and Kerem Navot, two Israeli advocacy groups that oppose settlements and track their development, covering data up to the end of December 2024.
Settlers established 49 new illegal shepherding outposts between October 7, 2023, and December 2024, seizing large swathes of surrounding land, according to the report which was corroborated by a CNN analysis of satellite imagery of the area.
CNN partnered with the US artificial intelligence company RAIC Labs to monitor the establishment and expansion of new outposts in the West Bank. RAIC Labs used its AI-powered platform to analyze and compare satellite imagery of the West Bank captured by Planet Labs in October 2023 and September 2024, identifying changes in the 49 outposts such as newly constructed structures, recently cleared areas, and emerging roads, which were manually verified by CNN.
Peace Now and Kerem Navot estimate that shepherding outposts, occupied by a few hundred settlers, now cover almost 14% of the West Bank. Some of the unauthorized outposts are run by extremist Israeli settlers and settler groups that were sanctioned under the Biden administration, according to the monitoring groups.
Of the total land seized by settlers in the West Bank since the 1990s using herding outposts, 70% has been taken in the last two and half years alone, the report found.
“It’s important to understand that the herding outposts are a national project, a state project. This is not a project which is initiated by individuals, it’s a project which the state of Israel is standing behind, is budgeting for, is facilitating, is protecting,” Dror Etkes, founder of Kerem Navot and co-author of the report, told CNN.
CNN reached out to several members of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, for comment on the practice, but none agreed to an interview. CNN also requested comment from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, but did not receive a response.
The IDF told CNN that its “top priority was to ensure the security of all residents in the area.” It added that, through the Civil Administration, it works to enforce against illegal structures in Area C, which comprises about 60% of the West Bank and is fully Israeli-controlled, “in accordance with the operational situation assessment and with approval from the political echelon.”
‘Empowered to do whatever they want’
There is no official planning approval for outposts, unlike officially recognized Jewish settlements, which tend to be larger, more organized urban developments. Settlements are considered illegal under international law and by much of the international community, but Israel disputes that.
For Palestinians living near the outposts, their expansion in recent years has often meant losing access to their land and natural resources, as roads, fences, and settler activity gradually cut them off.
The land grabs have gone hand-in-hand with an escalation in violence by Israeli security forces and settlers against Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank.
Israel’s defense minister said at the end of February that he had instructed the military to “prevent the return of residents” who had been displaced by Israel’s military operations in four refugee camps in the northern part of the territory beginning January 21. The United Nations estimated that some 40,000 have been forced to flee their homes.
There are also mounting concerns among Palestinians that US President Donald Trump may endorse annexation of the occupied territory, which is home to more than 3 million Palestinians. “We’re discussing that with many of your representatives,” Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu in Washington, DC, in February. “People do like the idea, but we haven’t taken a position on it yet.”
His proposal for Gaza to be emptied of its inhabitants and developed have raised alarm among rights groups and Palestinian communities, who worry a similar rhetoric could be applied to the occupied West Bank.
Israel seized the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967. It annexed East Jerusalem, which is also considered occupied under international law, in 1980.
Hagit Ofran, who works with Peace Now and co-authored the report, told CNN: “It is hard to believe President Trump or anyone in his administration would stand against the formal annexation of lands in the West Bank to Israel. No wonder the settlers and the Israeli government feel empowered to do whatever they want.”
According to the report from Peace Now and Kerem Navot, more than 60 Palestinian shepherding communities have been forcibly displaced since July 2022 – the majority of these since October 7.
At least 14 illegal herding outposts have since been built on or near land from which Palestinians were expelled just beforehand, the report said. CNN verified the establishment of those outposts by analyzing satellite imagery, detecting new dirt roads, buildings and bulldozing.
Etkes told CNN the practice was not only forcing Palestinians off their land but paving the way to settlement expansion. “Communities who are dependent on agriculture, who are dependent on herding, have to flee. It’s not only an economic catastrophe, but also a cultural catastrophe, a personal catastrophe,” Etkes said.
“The idea behind it is clear, it is to take the open areas in the West Bank to make sure Palestinians cannot access them, and eventually to hand them over to Israeli settlers.”
In July last year, the United Nations’ top court said Israel should end its decades-long occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, evacuating settlers from the territories designated for a future Palestinian state and halting any new settlement activity. Israel’s foreign minister at the time rejected the non-binding ruling as “fundamentally wrong” and one-sided.
Despite outposts being illegal even under Israeli law, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has said there is a “consistent pattern of Israeli authorities’ involvement, assistance and financing of the construction of outposts, as well as their operation.”
Documents uncovered by Peace Now last year showed how the Israeli government has budgeted millions to protect the small, unauthorized farms. The monitoring group said the money paid for vehicles, drones, cameras, generators, electric gates, light poles, solar panels and fences.
The Israeli government approved 75 million shekels ($21 million) in December 2023 for providing security in the West Bank to what it called “young settlements.” Orit Strock, the Minister of Settlements and National Mission, told the Associated Press that the funds were coordinated with the Defense Ministry and “carried out in accordance with all laws.”
The Ministry of Settlements and Strock’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
CNN has seen evidence that an organization with close links to the Israeli state has helped settlers set up herding outposts. Contracts obtained by Peace Now from the World Zionist Organization (WZO) — an international body that helped create the Jewish state — and reviewed by CNN show how the group has allocated land in the West Bank to settlers.
Israeli law affords the WZO semi-governmental status, giving it authority “for the development and settlement of the country.” The WZO’s Settlement Division, which describes itself as an “arm of the Israeli state” and is funded by Israeli public money, is responsible for managing the allocation of land to “form and strengthen the settlement of Jews in periphery areas, by increasing the hold on the lands of the country that were passed onto the division by the government of Israel,” according to its website.
While the contracts obtained by Peace Now specify the land is for grazing or farming, the watchdog said that it found in some cases that the WZO had given settlers rights to private land belonging to Palestinians and that outposts were also built on the land illegally. CNN’s satellite imagery analysis found that buildings and roads have already been constructed on or near 18 of these sites.
CNN has reached out to the WZO multiple times for comment on the construction of illegal outposts on land it had allocated. The organization has not replied.
Most of the land seized by settlers for illegal shepherding outposts is not classified as Israeli state land, according to mapping data from the Israeli Civil Administration analyzed by Peace Now and Kerem Navot. Nearly 60% of the land, around 470 square kilometers, is either privately owned by Palestinians, has unclear ownership, or falls within Palestinian Authority territory, the report said.
For Ahmed Daraghma, a Palestinian farmer from al-Farisiyah in the Jordan Valley, a 2021 contract granted by the WZO’s Settlement Division and viewed by CNN appeared to belatedly legitimize Tene Yarok, a herding outpost that threatens his home and livelihood, leaving him with few options. “The situation here is extremely difficult. Since October 7, it’s been getting harder day by day,” he told CNN.
Daraghma said that settlers regularly chase away his sheep and terrorize the community’s children late into the night. “They threaten us that if we go up to this mountain there, they will come to us at night. They say, ‘If you go here, we will come to take your children,’” he said.
A few weeks later, he said his family was forced to flee.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/middleeast/israel-gaza-netanyahu-protest-war-resume-intl/index.html,Fury toward Netanyahu as Israelis protest renewed war in Gaza,2025-03-19 11:05:09,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fury from protesters outside Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem, a day after he resumed the war in Gaza, shattering the two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas.
On Highway 1 – the main road connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem – protesters held a banner reading: “The future of the coalition or the future of Israel.”
The banner underlined a message delivered by thousands of people to the capital on Wednesday: That over nearly 18 months of war and fragile ceasefires, Netanyahu continues to prioritize his political survival over the security of his country, the lives of Israeli hostages and those of Palestinians in Gaza.
The anger in those accusations was palpable on Wednesday, just a day after Israel bombarded Gaza, killing more than 400 people and injuring hundreds more, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry – marking one of the war’s deadliest days.
The Israeli military said Wednesday that it had launched “targeted ground activities” in Gaza, partially recapturing a key area in the territory.
For Netanyahu, breaking the ceasefire has helped shore up his shaky coalition amid his ongoing corruption trial and ahead of a key vote on Israel’s budget.
The resumption of fighting won Netanyahu back the support of Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister who quit the government in protest against January’s ceasefire deal. On Tuesday, shortly after the fresh bombardment of Gaza, his Jewish Power party announced it would rejoin Netanyahu’s coalition.
But for many Israelis, the renewed fighting has stirred feelings of despair – and rage with the government. For Palestinians, it means the end of a brief respite that lasted just two months.
Plus, restarting the war doesn’t align with what many Israelis want, according to recent polling from the Jerusalem-based think tank the Israel Democracy Institute, who said in early March that the vast majority of Israeli supported the ceasefire.
Over 70% of Israelis supported negotiating with Hamas for an end to the fighting and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages, the Institute said. Notably, a large proportion (61.5%) of voters from Netanyahu’s Likud party supported continuing the second stage of the ceasefire deal, it said.
Now, as Netanyahu digs in his heels with the renewed campaign, many worry about how an already fractured society will fare.
Protesting alongside thousands outside the Knesset, Yuval Yairi, an artist from Jerusalem and former director of an art school, told CNN he believed the fighting had been restarted for political reasons – saying Netanyahu needed his right-wing allies on-side ahead of the March 31 budget vote deadline – and said the war was corrosive of Israel’s democracy.
“I’m very concerned about the possibility of a civil war. This nation is divided. It sometimes seems there’s no way out. People don’t believe in democracy anymore. They don’t believe in the life that we had before everything started. You see the division: religion on one side, secularism on the other. It seems hopeless,” Yairi said.
Eliad Shraga, chairman for the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a legal watchdog, agreed that Netanyahu’s war in Gaza was being waged to keep him in power.
“Netanyahu wanted to escape justice. This is the only reason we are facing the regime coup and this bloody war. This is a dangerous mixture,” Shraga told CNN.
Netanyahu had been scheduled to testify in his corruption trial on Tuesday, but the hearing was canceled due to the resumption of military activities in Gaza just hours before he was due in court. The prime minister denies any wrongdoing.
“One reason he wanted to escape justice is because he wants to keep his coalition and he is ready to sacrifice his people, this is it. It’s very simple,” said Shraga, adding that the resumption of fighting showed once more that Netanyahu “doesn’t care about the hostages” in Gaza who were due to be freed under the ceasefire deal.
“We are sacrificing our kids in this, (while) our (Prime Minister) sells his soul,” said Shraga.
Netanyahu has argued that military pressure on Hamas is necessary to return the hostages.
‘Taking away our democracy’
Opposition leader Yair Lapid joined Wednesday’s demonstration, which he said aim to “make sure that the government understands they cannot do whatever they want.”
Wearing a yellow ribbon to signal his support for the hostages held in Gaza, Lapid told CNN the protesters are “trying to tell the people of the world that Israel is not going to stay silent when they’re taking away our democracy.”
As demonstrators banged pots and pants and chanted, “Bring them home now,” a Knesset committee approved a contentious bill seeking to change the make-up of the panel that selects Israel’s judges, called the Judicial Selection Committee.
Under a framework proposed in January by Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, this bill would replace the two independent lawyers currently on the panel with one representative from the governing coalition and one from the opposition.
The bill is associated with the controversial judicial overhaul package sought by Netanyahu’s government in 2023 before the war in Gaza began – which sparked some of the largest protests in Israel’s history.
Although the bill is not as drastic as some of the 2023 measures, critics say it would politicize the selection committee by watering down the influence of independent lawyers.
Lapid said the “extremist” bill will ensure that “judges will be in the politicians’ pocket.”
“The politicians will appoint them, control them, ensure that they do anything they’re told,” Lapid said after the panel approved the bill, which now needs to pass second and third readings in the parliamentary plenum before it can become law.
Still, as thousands rallied against what they view as Netanyahu’s assault on democracy outside the Knesset, some were showing support for the prime minister and his renewed war aims.
Standing in the “Heroism and Hope Forum” tent, a group that supports continued military action in Gaza, Margalit Yachad, a volunteer ambulance driver, said she believes Netanyahu is acting in the country’s best interest.
“I don’t know why there’s so much hate about him or the right. We should respect the leader first and not say horrible things about him, because the enemy sees that we are all broken into parts — and we can’t win like that,” Yachad told CNN.","['Kara Fox', 'Nic Robertson', 'Mike Schwartz', 'Christian Edwards', 'Tamar Michaelis']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-ceasefire-explainer-intl/index.html,Israel has resumed the war in Gaza. Why now?,2025-03-18 14:37:49,"The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, just two months old, has been shaky for some time. But that was thoroughly shattered by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza starting in the early hours of Tuesday morning.
The strikes killed many hundreds of Palestinians. Tuesday was the deadliest day in Gaza since the first weeks of the conflict that started in late 2023.
The military said Wednesday that it had launched “targeted ground activities” in Gaza and partially retaken the key Netzarim Corridor, which bisects the strip. Strikes across the Gaza Strip also continued into Wednesday, including in Al-Mawasi, which for some time has been designated a safe zone by the Israeli military, despite continued attacks there.
And Israel has again issued mandatory evacuation orders for swaths of Gaza, dropping flyers ordering civilians to move. Once again, Palestinians are being uprooted.
“From now on, negotiations will only take place under fire,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address Tuesday night. “I want to assure you: This is just the beginning.”
Here’s what to know about the resumption of the conflict.
Why did Israel return to war?
The Israeli government has given different reasons.
Overnight, Israel’s defense minister Israel Katz said that the attacks were “due to Hamas’ refusal to release the hostages and threats to harm IDF soldiers and Israeli communities.”
If that sounds like the same reason Israel has given for attacking Gaza since October 7, 2023, that’s because it is. Israel’s war goals in Gaza are to return the remaining hostages taken by Hamas and destroy Hamas’ governing and military capabilities.
Later Tuesday, Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson said that the attacks were because “Hamas rejected two concrete mediation proposals presented by the US president’s envoy, Steve Witkoff.” More on that in a moment.
An Israeli official said Israel’s airstrikes in Gaza are the first phase in a series of escalatory military actions aimed at pressuring Hamas into releasing more hostages, marking a return to Netanyahu’s view that military pressure is the most effective way to secure the release of hostages.
Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has brought eight living hostages back to Israel, out of 251 taken by Hamas and its allies.
Israeli domestic politics is a big factor.
The far right in Israel never liked the Gaza ceasefire, because they see it as a capitulation to Hamas. They want all Palestinians to leave Gaza, and for Israel to reestablish the settlements it evacuated in 2005.
Netanyahu needs that faction in order to govern. One far-right minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, quit the government in protest of the ceasefire. Another, Bezalel Smotrich, said he would leave if Israel didn’t return to war. That would have ripped apart Netanyahu’s government coalition.
But on Tuesday, Ben Gvir’s party – Jewish Power – announced that it would rejoin the government. That’s a huge political victory for Netanyahu and the stability of his coalition.
The return of conflict in Gaza will also distract from Netanyahu’s desire to fire the head or Israel’s international security agency, Shin Bet. That decision, announced on Sunday, has drawn calls for massive protests.
Both Smotrich and Ben Givr think that Israel has been too timid in conducting the war.
“This is a phased operation that we have planned and built in recent weeks since the new IDF Chief of Staff took office,” Smotrich said on Tuesday. “And with God’s help, it will look completely different from what has been done so far.”
What happened to ceasefire talks?
Israel and Hamas began a ceasefire on January 19, with the first phase lasting 42 days. Hamas has made it clear that it wants to start negotiations for a potential second phase, as outlined in the truce agreement.
Under the terms of the second phase, Israel would have to withdraw entirely from Gaza and commit to a permanent end of the war. In exchange, Hamas would release all living hostages.
Israel has made clear it wants new terms. It wants Hamas to continue releasing hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners – but without any commitment to end the war or withdraw its military.
The two sides were meant to discuss a second phase starting February 3, but the Israeli government ignored that deadline.
Breaking with decades of tradition, the US started talking directly with Hamas, which it considers a terrorist organization. And Israel has sent negotiating teams to Qatar and Egypt, as recently as Sunday, “in an effort to advance the negotiations.”
Israel says that US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a month-long extension of the ceasefire through Ramadan and then Passover in late April – but without any of the commitments made in January. Hamas immediately rejected that plan, saying that Netanyahu and his government were carrying out “a blatant coup against the ceasefire deal” that had already been agreed.
It’s been clear that the two sides are oceans apart.
Hamas offered last week to release the American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, along with the bodies of four other dual nationals – presumably four dead American-Israelis. In exchange, it said Israel must abide by “the three-phase ceasefire deal signed by all parties on January 17, 2025.”
Israel called that offer “psychological warfare.”
Has the war resumed in full?
The Israeli military has given very few details about its operation. Their first announcement said they were carrying out “extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip.”
Later in the day Tuesday, the military ordered Palestinians in swaths of Gaza, kilometers from the border with Israel, to leave their homes.
That has given rise to speculation that Israel may be preparing a renewed ground invasion – and may even try to occupy urban centers in Gaza, something it has not done until now.
After the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, Israel withdrew its troops to Gaza’s borders – with Egypt to the south, and with Israel to the north and east.
It is unlikely to stop its escalating military offensive without a deal to release additional hostages, determined to force Hamas to negotiate under fire.
Israel plans to gradually ramp up military operations in Gaza, the Israeli official said, but it remains unclear how soon Israel could send ground troops into combat in Gaza again.
On the other hand, Hamas and its allies – which have killed hundreds of Israeli soldiers in Gaza since October 7, 2023 – appear to be committed to the terms of the existing ceasefire, for now.
Israel has claimed a few times since January 19 that rockets from Gaza had been launched, but well within the territory. But they have not provided evidence for that, and Hamas has not launched rockets into Israel for the two months of the truce.
What does this mean for Gazans?
It is devastating.
Tuesday is already the deadliest single day in Gaza for well over a year – since November 7, 2023, when 548 Palestinians were killed.
It has been more than two weeks since Israel blocked all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza – a response, it said, to Hamas’ refusal to agree to new Israeli terms for the truce. War will exacerbate that suffering.
Already on Tuesday, masses of Palestinians have been seen once again on the move, ordered by the military to take what little they have and leave areas deemed unsafe.
Ahmad Al Shaafi, who has been sheltering in Deir el Balah, told CNN that the bombardment began around 2 a.m.
“Don’t the Israelis have any promises they are committed to? It was a terrifying night,” he said. “Only God is merciful. There are still two children under the rubble – one 26 years old and the other 5. We cannot retrieve them.”
The Israeli military has killed just under 49,000 Palestinians in Gaza since Hamas’ October 7 attack – the majority of them civilians – according to the health ministry there.
“Fueling ‘hell on earth’ by resuming the war will only bring more despair & suffering,” the UN’s top official on Palestinian affairs, Philippe Lazzarini, said on Tuesday.
What does this mean for the hostages?
It is a huge blow. There are still 59 hostages in Gaza, of whom 24 are believed to be alive.
The families of those still held are outraged.
“The Israeli government chose to give up on the hostages,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. “We are shocked, angry, and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas.”
What role did the US play?
Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Monday that “the Trump administration and the White House were consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza.”
US President Donald Trump took credit for the ceasefire that began just before he took office, and his aides played a big role in pushing Netanyahu to accept it.
But he has also made clear that he would be supportive of Israel relaunching the war.
“I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,” he said in a statement earlier this month. “RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!”

“I’m just so sad there isn’t a single strand of hair to comb with my brush,” Sama told CNN with her head in her hands. “I hold the mirror because I want to brush my hair: I really want to brush my hair again.”
For the eight-year-old, the movement brings back memories of a life before October 7, 2023 – when she had long hair and played outside with her friends in northern Gaza’s Jabalya. But since then, Sama and her family have been among the estimated 1.9 million Palestinians forcibly displaced from their homes, fleeing first to the enclave’s southern Rafah region under Israeli military orders. As the violence escalated, Sama moved to a displacement camp in central Gaza’s Khan Younis.
Israel launched a war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people – mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and kidnapping more than 250. Israel’s military offensive, paused for almost two months under a fragile ceasefire deal, has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency, estimated in a report last June that nearly all of Gaza’s 1.2 million children need psychological support, especially those exposed to repeated traumatic events.
A week after the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was announced in January, the UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, told the UN Security Council that “a generation has been traumatized.”
“Children have been killed, starved and frozen to death,” Fletcher said, adding that “some died before their first breath – perishing with their mothers in childbirth.”
Israel launched a fresh barrage of airstrikes early Tuesday, shattering the ceasefire and killing hundreds of Palestinians, health officials in Gaza said. A doctor told CNN the scenes at one Gaza City hospital were “nothing close to anything I’ve experienced before” and that the majority of cases she had seen were children.
CNN’s interviews with the families and experts featured in this article were conducted before the resumption of violence.
‘Why won’t my hair grow?’
Last year, doctors diagnosed that Sama’s hair loss was a result of “nervous shock,” specifically after her neighbor’s house in Rafah was hit by an Israeli airstrike in August. The traumatic upending of her daily life since October 7 also likely contributed to her alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss, they said.
A report late last year by the War Child Alliance and Gaza-based Community Training Centre for Crisis Management highlights the severe psychological toll on children of Israel’s onslaught in Gaza over the past year. The report, based on a survey of more than 500 caregivers of vulnerable children, found that 96% of children in those circumstances felt that death was imminent and nearly half – 49% – had expressed a “wish to die” because of Israel’s assault.
Sama’s mental anguish intensified after she was bullied by other children for her hair loss, leading her to retreat indoors. Outside, she wears a pink bandana to cover her scalp.
“Mama I’m tired – I want to die. Why won’t my hair grow?” she pleaded with her mother, Om-Mohammed, when CNN visited the family in September 2024, before asking if she would remain bald forever.
“I want to die and have my hair grow in Paradise; God willing.”
With the tenuous ceasefire in place, tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians started moving back home toward northern Gaza. Sama’s house was flattened in Israel’s bombardment and she and her family remained in Khan Younis, unable to afford travel costs to return home.
“Our house was bombed, and inside it were so many memories – my photos, my certificates. I had dresses and so many belongings, but the house was destroyed, and I haven’t been able to see it since,” Sama said when CNN revisited the family in February.
“Transportation costs are too high, and even if we go, there is no water, and we don’t know where we would stay,” she continued.
Mental health in Gaza
Providing mental health services in Gaza has always come with challenges. But Dr. Yasser Abu Jamei, director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP), explained that during Israel’s 15-month assault his staff had also suffered trauma which made it difficult to treat others.
“Most of my staff are working from displaced places and only less than 10 of them are still in their homes,” Abu Jamei, director of Gaza’s biggest mental health program, told CNN in an interview before the ceasefire was agreed in January.
“They still carry on and try to bring some hope and support to families (while) working in shelters.”
One technique he said the GCMHP employs is drawing therapy, which allows children to express their feelings through non-verbal communication. He recalled an instance in which giving a child the space to draw enabled them to talk to a GCMHP psychologist about their pain.
“(The child said) my friends are in heaven, but one of them, they found him without his head,” Abu Jamei said. “How could he go to heaven while his head is not there? (The child) continued to cry.”
While the fragile ceasefire held, Abu Jamei said the GCMHP was employing a mental health plan to treat patients which could last for up to six months. GCMHP workers were “relieved” by the pause in fighting, he added, but still felt a “heaviness of the work that awaits them.”
‘A drone came and killed them’
Seven-year-old Anas Abu Eish and his sister Doa, aged eight, live with their grandmother Om-Alabed in a displacement camp in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis. The siblings suffered the loss of their parents in an Israeli strike.
“I was playing with my ball, I went down the stairs and I found Dad and Mom, thrown in the street, a drone came and exploded (on) them,” Anas told CNN in November 2024.
Om-Alabed said the children had been deeply affected by what happened and that Anas experiences moments of aggression whenever he sees other children being embraced by their mothers.
“I frequently remind people to be understanding, as he has lost not only his parents but also the safety, security, warmth, and affection (they) provided,” she said.
When CNN began to interview Doa, she distracted herself by applying pressure to her nails; seconds later she began to cry.
Reviewing the footage of Anas and Doa, with the consent of their grandmother, Israeli psychologist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Edna Foa told CNN that she remained hopeful the siblings could make a recovery.
“They are interacting. I’ve seen children, they just look at you and they don’t say anything. They don’t cry, they just look at the space (around them), I worry about (those) children more,” Foa said.
Though their home is close by in Rafah, Anas and Doa remained in Al-Mawasi even after the truce was agreed, unable to return as it was under a “red zone” designation – an area considered likely to be targeted if hostilities resumed.
Om-Alabed said after the ceasefire was announced, they did travel back and found their house in ruins. It felt too dangerous to stay there. “We couldn’t handle it,” she said. “We are here waiting and dreaming that our red zone becomes a green zone so we can go back and put our tents over the rubble.”
“All the buildings are crashed into each other,” Om-Alabed continued. “To walk from here to there, you have to climb rubble as if you are climbing a mountain, just to get to our area.”
‘There was sand in my mouth, I was screaming’
In the same displacement camp, six-year-old Manal Jouda calmly recalls the night her home was destroyed, killing her parents and trapping her under the rubble. She described the terror of waiting to be rescued.
“There was sand in my mouth, I was screaming, they dug with a shovel, our neighbor was saying ‘this is Manal, this is Manal.’ I was awake, my eyes were opened under the rubble, my mouth was opened, and sand was coming into it,” she said.
“This is the kind of child I would follow to see if there was a way of reducing the pain her brain will hold later on,” Foa said of Manal.
Even with a ceasefire, children need stability to help aid their healing, Foa said. But she believes that with the right treatment, Palestinian children can make a partial recovery.
“They will never be the same as before the war, but they will recover in the sense that they could be functional,” she said.
“They can be content most of the time, not be distressed, not being dysfunctional and go on with their life.”
But for children like Sama, stability remains out of reach.
‘My friends have hair, and I don’t’
Heavy rain and strong winds have battered displacement camps, destroying makeshift tents and leaving the young girl and other Palestinian families with little shelter.
Even with a truce in place, her hair didn’t grow back and she wonders if it ever will.
“Every time my hair starts to grow, I look at it with hope, but then it falls out again,” she said.
Her mother explained that Sama feels ashamed of having no hair, even in front of her sisters, and feels she can’t restart her life until it regrows.
“Sama always told me ‘I want to go to the north to find my clothes and my memories,’” Om-Mohammed said.
“But now she has changed her mind and says ‘where would we go? We don’t have a home anymore; all my friends have hair, and I don’t.’”","['Zahid Mahmood', 'Abeer Salman', 'Tareq Al Hilou', 'Video Beatriz Grimault', 'Beatriz Grimault']",en

Gaza experienced its deadliest day in over 15 months on Tuesday, according to a CNN count, when Israel’s overnight bombardments struck multiple locations across the territory. More than 400 people were killed, according to Palestinian authorities, in the most extensive strikes since a months-long truce came into effect, with Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz declaring: “Tonight we returned to fighting in Gaza.”
The deal between Israel and Hamas was already hanging in the balance with phase one ending more than two weeks ago and all sides at loggerheads over a path forward that might see remaining Israeli hostages freed and a permanent peace secured.
Israel’s military and security agency said they were “currently conducting extensive strikes” on Hamas targets in Gaza. In response, Hamas accused Netanyahu of deciding to overturn the ceasefire agreement, and “putting the captives in Gaza at risk of an unknown fate.”
Speaking in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night, Netanyahu said Hamas refused to release hostages or accept a US proposal to extend the Gaza ceasefire, despite a pause in Israel’s military activity. “This is why I authorized yesterday the renewal of military action against Hamas,” he said.
Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif Al-Qanou said the group wanted to see the ceasefire deal continue and had not rejected the US proposal on the table. He said Hamas is constantly in touch with mediators in the wake of renewed hostilities.
Gaza officials said more than 170 children were killed in the overnight attack, in what the United Nations children’s agency said was one of the largest single-day child death tolls in the past year globally.
“It’s been absolutely horrific,” said Dr. Razan Al-Nahhas, a physician volunteering with the Humanity Auxilium organization at the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. “Multiple explosions within just a span of a few minutes back-to-back.”
Videos obtained by CNN showed scenes of panic and chaos across Gaza as families desperately rushed wounded loved ones to overwhelmed hospitals and rescue workers transported patients in ambulances or on stretchers.
Many of the wounded were covered with bloodstained blankets, while others had their limbs wrapped in bloodied bandages. Several hospitals said the casualties were due to civilian homes being hit by the strikes.
Later on Tuesday, the Israeli military said it launched a “massive offensive” in Gaza and ordered civilians in multiple neighborhoods to evacuate, raising fears of further mass displacement.
‘They keep bringing more bodies’
In Gaza City, the volunteer doctor said the strikes began at around 2 a.m. local time and the Al-Ahli clinic had been receiving patients non-stop. Most of the casualties were children, she said.
“Babies, children all over the floor, bleeding from their heads, bleeding from their abdomens. Extremity injuries,” Al-Nahhas told CNN.
From a balcony in one of the hospital buildings, Al-Nahhas said she “can see all the bodies of the people that have been killed lined up,” saying at least 50 of them were “just wrapped in blankets” because there was no morgue.
It is a similar picture across the enclave. Israeli strikes have dealt a blow to “an exhausted healthcare system suffering from a shortage of medications and a severe lack of medical equipment,” the head of the enclave’s biggest hospital said.
Standing amid the rubble in the Deir al-Balah area of Gaza, resident Rajab Abu Sultan told CNN “we have been pulling the remains of children” from the debris. He added that the bodies being recovered were “all civilians, children” and that there had been “no prior warning.”
‘As long as necessary’
Israel’s resumption of strikes comes as renewed violence flares in the Middle East.
Dozens of people were reported killed after US President Donald Trump ordered “decisive” military action against Houthi rebels in Yemen, opening a new salvo against the Iran-backed group that has targeted shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The group on Tuesday said it would continue its attacks on American and Israeli interests until the hostilities in Gaza cease. Meanwhile, deadly cross-border attacks have underscored escalating tensions between Lebanon and Syria’s new Islamist-led government.
Israel had notified the Trump administration ahead of its strikes on Gaza, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
Later on Tuesday the top US diplomat at the UN said that “the blame for the resumption of hostilities” in Gaza “lies solely with Hamas.” Charge d’affaires Dorothy Shea reiterated the sentiment at a UN Security Council meeting, saying that Hamas “has steadfastly refused every proposal and deadline they have been presented over the past few weeks.”
The Israeli military has continued to operate inside Gaza since the start of the ceasefire on January 19, but Tuesday’s airstrikes are the clearest sign that efforts to extend the truce have collapsed.
Netanyahu and Defense Minister Katz ordered the operation, accusing Hamas of “repeatedly” refusing to release hostages and rejecting all offers from United States presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and mediators.
Far-right Israeli politician Itamar Ben Gvir, who resigned as national security minister in January over the ceasefire deal, will rejoin the government along with his Otzma Yehudit, or Jewish Power, party after the Israeli military resumed the war in Gaza.
But former hostages and members of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum condemned the renewed offensive, saying it was detrimental to the remaining hostages, and urged the government to return to the negotiating table.
“Military operations endanger their lives directly,” recently-released hostage Sasha Troufanov said at a rally at Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square.
The Israeli strikes come days after the US put forward a new proposal that would secure the release of a handful of living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a month-long extension of the ceasefire.
Under the US proposal, Israel would also lift its blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza, a source familiar with the negotiations said.
Hamas said Friday it had responded to a proposal to extend the truce, “which included its approval” to release American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander and the bodies of four dual nationals held hostage in Gaza.
But on Tuesday, Hamas leader Ezzat al-Rishq said the new airstrikes were a “death sentence” for the remaining Israeli hostages held in the enclave.
An Israeli official claimed the extensive attack in Gaza Tuesday was “preemptive” and said the strikes would “continue as long as necessary and will expand beyond airstrikes.”
The official declined to provide any details about what they claimed was Hamas’ “readiness to execute terror attacks, build up force and re-arm,” but said the strikes were targeting the group’s “mid-ranking military commanders, leadership officials and terrorist infrastructure.”
Hamas strongly rejected Israel’s claims that it violated the Gaza ceasefire and was preparing attacks on Israel, while seemingly opting not to respond militarily hours after Israel resumed fighting in Gaza.
The group said claims that it was preparing to strike Israeli forces were “baseless” pretexts to justify Israel’s return to war and designed to “mislead public opinion.”
Hamas is not known to have fired rockets at Israel in several weeks. It also appears to have refrained from striking Israel or its soldiers in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on January 19.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/middleeast/lebanon-says-cross-border-attack-syria-intl/index.html,Lebanon and Syria agree to ceasefire after cross-border attacks kill 10,2025-03-17 00:00:00,"The defense ministers of Syria and Lebanon agreed to a ceasefire on Monday, Syria’s state-run SANA news agency reported, after cross-border attacks left 10 dead and more than 50 wounded.
The two officials also agreed to strengthen coordination and cooperation between their countries, according to SANA.
The agreement follows an escalation of tensions between Beirut and Syria’s new Islamist-led government. In the past two days, cross-border attacks have killed three Syrians and seven Lebanese, according to the two governments, with 52 people being wounded on the Lebanese side.
On Monday, Syria shelled Lebanese villages on the border after three Syrians died in the northern Lebanese town of Qasr, according to the Lebanese military, which said its forces responded to the attack.
The Syrian shelling also targeted Qasr, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said.
On Sunday, Syria’s defense ministry accused the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah of kidnapping three Syrian troops from Syrian territory in an ambush, the state news agency SANA reported, saying they were “taken to Lebanese territory and executed on the spot.”
It also said that a photographer and reporter were injured on the Syria-Lebanon border after being struck by a “Hezbollah missile.”
The Lebanese army said that two Syrians were killed at the border and another died in hospital, and that the three bodies were handed over to Syria.
Hezbollah denied involvement in the border clashes, the Lebanese state news agency NNA reported, saying it “has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.”
In response, Lebanon’s presidency said Monday that tensions on the country’s frontier with Syria “cannot go on.”
“What is happening on the eastern and northeastern borders cannot go on, and we will not accept its continuation,” the presidency said on X.
If confirmed to have been conducted by Syria, the attack on Lebanon would mark rare action by Syria’s new government on one of its neighbors. The country’s leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has repeatedly said he wants to maintain stability with Syria’s neighbors and has so far refrained from responding to repeated Israeli strikes on his country.
The clashes are a sign of growing tensions at the Lebanon-Syria border, northeast of the Beqaa valley, where predominantly Shiite Lebanese villages have seen skirmishes with Syrian soldiers in recent weeks.
Syria’s new government is led by former Sunni-Islamist militants who ousted the regime of Iran-allied Bashar al-Assad late last year. Shiite Hezbollah had intervened in Syria during the country’s civil war to help Assad fight the Sunni militants.",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/middleeast/latifeh-abdellatif-israel-detention-intl-latam/index.html,Well-known Palestinian journalist detained by Israeli police over alleged ‘incitement’,2025-03-17 17:29:48,"Israeli police are seeking to keep a well-known Palestinian journalist in detention in Jerusalem on charges related to “incitement” and “support of terrorism,” despite an Israeli judge ordering her release on Monday.
Latifeh Abdellatif is a freelance photojournalist whose work has appeared in Reuters, ABC News, BBC, Al Jazeera and TRT, according to her Instagram account biography.
Israeli police said that she was apprehended at her home in the Old City on Sunday by Jerusalem District Police officers “on suspicion of incitement and support for terrorism.”
Abdellatif’s lawyer and her mother said she was arrested in the street on her way home, by officers arriving in unmarked vehicles.
Abdellatif denies the charges.
In a statement, police pointed to Abdellatif’s posting of a video of late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in which he says he wants to die as a “martyr.”
“In these and other posts, it is evident that the suspect praises and glorifies the actions of terrorist organizations,” the statement said.
Abdellatif appeared via video link at a magistrates’ court in Jerusalem on Monday, where a judge denied a police request to detain her for an additional five days in order to continue interrogations and investigation. At one point during the hearing, Abdellatif smiled and made a heart-shaped gesture with her hands.
“The court found that based on her work as a journalist and based on the defense that these posts are part of her professional work, and that the posts are more than six months old, there is no need for keeping her in detention and she doesn’t create a danger to the public,” Abdellatif’s lawyer Nasser Odeh told CNN after the hearing.
Odeh said the judge ordered Abdellatif’s release “under restrictive conditions.”
He said this included 2,000 Israeli shekels ($550) to be paid for bail and another 10,000 shekels as a guarantee that she would show up once called in for investigation.
However, Israeli police immediately appealed the decision, seeking to stop her release.
“The police have requested to freeze the decision of the release until they submit an appeal with the central court. Right now, the release decision has been frozen until the appeal process goes into effect,” the lawyer said.
Odeh told CNN that Abdellatif had been interrogated for three hours on Sunday “about social media posts that are part of her professional work as a journalist.”
Targeted ‘for the smallest things’
Abdellatif lives and works in Jerusalem. She has in the past reported on the tensions around access to the al-Aqsa mosque compound, monitoring clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian worshippers in the Old City.
CNN has witnessed her being harassed by Israeli security forces in the Old City on several occasions in the past, including being physically pushed aside and verbally abused. None of the occasions witnessed by CNN involved Abdellatif doing anything other than quietly standing on the side and using her camera to capture the events.
Abdellatif’s mother told CNN on Monday her daughter is a working single mother to a 7-year-old son and that she “has all the beautiful things in her character.”
Several of Abdellatif’s colleagues described her as “professional” and “dedicated.” One said she was “very kind and goes out of her way to help everyone, is respectable, and has good manners.”
One journalist told CNN that reporters in Jerusalem “are more concerned and afraid to cover the news that deals with Palestinian matters because it can easily be brought upon us as an incitement charge.”
Another journalist said that Jerusalem-based reporters feel “targeted by Israel security after the (October 7 Hamas attacks) for the smallest things.”
None of the journalists wanted to be named for fear of repercussions.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that since the start of the war in Gaza, an “unprecedented” number of journalists and media workers have been arrested in what they and their attorneys say is retaliation for their journalism and commentary.
As of March 13, 2025, CPJ had documented a total of 75 arrests of journalists in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem. Israel arrested 70; Palestinian authorities arrested five, it said.
The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate condemned Abdellatif’s arrest on Monday. In a statement, the syndicate said Israeli security authorities “have arrested and expelled eight journalists from the Old City and al-Aqsa Mosque since the beginning of this month.”","['Kareem Khadder', 'Abeer Salman', 'Eugenia Yosef', 'Pauline Lockwood', 'Ivana Kottasová']",en

Netanyahu met with Bar and informed him that he would propose his removal to the government this week, the prime minister’s office said on Sunday.
Netanyahu is believed to have majority support in government to remove Bar, but the move could be subject to appeals by Israel’s Supreme Court.
In a statement, Bar said that he intends to fulfill certain responsibilities before leaving his position.
“The duty of trust owed by the head of the Shin Bet is first and foremost to the citizens of Israel – this perception is what underlies all of my actions and decisions,” Bar said, “The Prime Minister’s expectation of a personal duty of trust whose purpose contradicts the public interest is a fundamentally wrong expectation.”
In a video statement released on Sunday, Netanyahu said his “ongoing distrust” of Bar led to this decision.
“At all times, but especially in such an existential war, the prime minister must have full confidence in the head of the Shin Bet,” Netanyahu said.
Netanyahu added that removing Bar would be necessary for achieving Israel’s war goals in Gaza and “preventing the next disaster.”
The prime minister has frequently criticized the agency, placing blame on its leaders for the security lapses that led to the Hamas October 7, 2023, attacks that killed more than 1,200 people.
Shin Bet, which is in charge of monitoring domestic threats to Israel, conducted an internal investigation that determined that the agency had “failed in its mission” to prevent the attacks.
In its investigation, Shin Bet also leveled implicit criticism at Netanyahu, saying that in the years leading up to its October 7 attack, Hamas was enriched by Qatari payments that were blessed by the Israeli government.
Its report also said that Hamas decided to attack when it did in part because of internal divisions in Israeli society fueled by Netanyahu’s attempts to pass judicial changes, which led to massive protest.
The agency also reportedly opened an investigation recently into members of Netanyahu’s office for inappropriately lobbying on behalf of Qatar - something his office denies.
Netanyahu also removed Bar and the head of the Mossad, David Barnea, from the negotiating team engaging in indirect talks with Hamas.
Opposition politicians criticized Netanyahu and suggested that Bar’s firing would be a politically motivated move.
“For a year and a half, he saw no reason to fire him, but only when the investigation into Qatar’s infiltration of Netanyahu’s office and the funds transferred to his closest aides began, did he suddenly feel an urgent need to fire him immediately,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said.
National Unity Chairman Benny Gantz said it would be a “direct violation of the state’s security and the dismantling of unity in Israeli society for political and personal reasons.”
Several far-right members of the government applauded Netanyahu’s intent to fire Bar on Sunday.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that it is a “necessary step” and that it would have been appropriate for the Shin Bet leader to “take real responsibility and resign on his own initiative more than a year ago.”
Israel’s former National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who had disputes with Bar over the treatment of Palestinian prisoners and other issues, asserted that Netanyahu’s decision shows “there is no place in a democratic state for officials who behave politically against me and against elected officials.” Ben Gvir has repeatedly called for Bar’s firing.",['Mitchell McCluskey'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/middleeast/israeli-attack-gaza-intl/index.html,"Nine killed in Israeli attack in northern Gaza, officials say, in deadliest strike since ceasefire began",2025-03-15 00:00:00,"At least nine people have been killed and several others injured in an Israeli strike in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, the enclave’s health ministry said, making it the deadliest incident since a ceasefire went into effect in January.
A British-based charity say almost all of those killed were aid workers, in what Hamas called a “blatant violation” of the truce.
The Israeli military said the strike had killed six “terrorists” who were operating and then attempted to retrieve a drone. Among them were a person involved in the Hamas-led October 7 attack, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
A team of eight charity workers were killed in the strike, according to UK-registered NGO Al-Khair Foundation. In a statement on Facebook, the charity’s founder Qasim Rashid Ahmad said it was a “very sad day” for the foundation and for aid workers around the world.
“Today sadly another attack has taken place on aid workers while delivering aid,” he said. Some of the victims “were our team members, including volunteers, some of them were cameramen… and some of them were journalists.”
He added that the aid workers had been carrying out humanitarian work when they came under attack, denying the allegation they were involved in terror.
Hamas accused the Israeli military in a statement of committing “a horrific massacre in Beit Lahia, claiming the lives of nine martyrs working for a charity engaged in humanitarian efforts at shelters and displacement centers.”
“The targeting of unarmed civilians, especially those providing humanitarian aid to displaced and homeless individuals, constitutes a blatant violation of international and humanitarian law,” Ismail Thawabta, Director General of Hamas’ Government Media Office, added.
The IDF said Saturday that six “terrorists” had been killed in the area of Beit Lahia as they were “operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF troops.”
“A number of terrorists were eliminated in the strike, including terrorists who operated under the cover of journalists,” it said in a statement.
One eyewitness, Mahmoud Louay Atiya, told CNN he had to put out a fire caused by the strike using bottles of water.
“I helped two people – one I pulled out was already dead, and the other was injured but still alive. I managed to take out multiple bodies. There were no ambulances or fire trucks,” he said.
Another man said that his 17-year-old son was killed in the attack, despite not being affiliated “with the resistance or Hamas.”
“He was working in one of the camps, and they told me he had been killed. I don’t know exactly how it happened,” he told CNN.
Israeli military operations inside Gaza have continued since the ceasefire began – in response, the IDF has said, to threats to its troops or Hamas violations, but there has been a decline in casualties.
Saturday’s deadly strike comes shortly after the United States put forward a new proposal that would secure the release of a handful of living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a month-long extension of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.
Under the US proposal, Israel would also lift its blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been ongoing for nearly two weeks, a source familiar with the negotiations said.
Hamas said Friday it had responded to a proposal to extend the ceasefire, “which included its approval” to release American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander and the bodies of four dual nationals held hostage in Gaza.

The militant group said Friday it had responded to a proposal to extend the Gaza ceasefire, “which included its approval” to release Alexander. It did not initially go into detail about what it wanted in exchange.
Qatar and Egypt have mediated indirect talks between Israel and Hamas.
“The movement responded with responsibility and positivity, submitting its reply at dawn today, which included its approval to release Zionist soldier Edan Alexander, who holds American citizenship, in addition to the bodies of four others with dual nationality.”
Late Friday night, the group provided further details on its conditions for the releases, saying it was “based on the three-phase ceasefire deal signed by all parties on January 17, 2025.”
Releasing Alexander and the other hostages, it said, was conditioned on Israel abiding by terms laid down in a multi-phased ceasefire agreed by the parties in January, including releasing Palestinian prisoners, allowing the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza-Egypt border, and starting negotiations on “phase two” of a ceasefire – which Israel has resisted.
Alexander would be the first male soldier to be released from Hamas captivity. In previous exchanges, Hamas has demanded a much higher price for the freedom of male soldiers than it has for civilians or women.
The group hasn’t identified the names of the dead hostages it is willing to release or specified when any hostages may be freed.
The United States has put forward a new proposal that would secure the release of a handful of living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a month-long extension of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, a source familiar with the negotiations said.
Under the US proposal, which was presented this week in Qatar by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Israel would also lift its blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been ongoing for nearly two weeks.
Its announcement comes days after the US said it was negotiating with Hamas directly over the ceasefire deal, going against its tradition of not talking to groups it considers terrorist organizations.
It also comes after US envoy Steve Witkoff visited the Qatari capital Doha for meetings with Arab officials on Wednesday, according to an Arab diplomat, and as Israel sent a delegation this week to Doha.
In a statement Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that “while Israel has accepted the Witkoff outline, Hamas remains steadfast in its refusal and has not budged a millimeter.”
“At the same time, it continues to engage in manipulation and psychological warfare,” it said, adding that the prime minister will convene with his team on Saturday night for “a detailed report from the negotiating team, and to decide on the next steps for the release of the hostages.”
Israel alleged that Hamas rejected a proposal put forth by Witkoff last week, which sought to extend a ceasefire in Gaza over the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and Jewish Passover holiday, without a commitment by Israel for a permanent ceasefire.
A senior Hamas official told CNN Friday that the group is still committed to the initial deal agreed with Israel that could bring the war in Gaza to an end. The official said the group accepted a proposal from mediators to release Alexander and the bodies of four dead dual national hostages as an exception.
Hamas has previously said it does not oppose releasing Alexander as part of negotiations to end the war, according to Hamas-affiliated Al Aqsa TV, citing senior Hamas official Taher Al Nunu. Hamas had relayed that message to US officials during recent talks, Al Nunu was cited as saying.
‘An all-American kid’
Alexander is the only American hostage believed to be alive in Gaza. Four other dead Americans are also held by Hamas – Judi Weinstein Haggai and her husband Gad Haggai, and soldiers Itay Chan and Omer Maxim Neutra.
At least 12 American Israelis are thought to have been captured during the militant group’s attack in Israel on October 7, 2023.
Hamas released a propaganda video of Alexander three months ago, showing the Israeli- American hostage pleading with Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump not to forget him and to do whatever they can to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. Netanyahu’s office had called it “the publication of the brutal psychological warfare video in which an important and exciting sign of life was received from Edan.”
Alexander’s father, Adi, told CNN Tuesday that they had seen the video, and that Alexander was “just holding up.”
“He is there, and he is alive, and just waiting patiently,” Adi said, adding that the family knows “he’s not in a great condition.”
“He lost a lot of weight, maybe suffer some injuries on October 7, because he was brutally attacked by more than more than 20 militants,” he said, describing his son as “an all-American kid.”
The Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum has criticized prioritizing the release of captives based on their nationalities, and called for the freeing of all hostages regardless of the passports they hold.
“The hostages returning should only be the opening to an agreement that will return everyone in one step and immediately,” the forum said, adding that otherwise it is “abandonment” that is “based on a foreign passport.”
“If Israel insists on stopping halfway and abandoning its citizens behind, every Jewish mom will know that she must issue a foreign passport to her child, or they will be abandoned,” the forum said.
Meanwhile, the fate of more than two million Palestinians in Gaza hinges on Israel’s next move. Israel has cut the flow of electricity to the last facility in Gaza that was still receiving power from the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) and has closed its main crossings with the enclave to aid.
The United Nations’ World Food Programme said on Friday that since March 2, the agency has not been able to transport any food supplies into Gaza due to the closure of all border crossing points for both humanitarian and commercial supplies, adding that the WFP has the equivalent of “two to three months of distributions for 1.1 million people, pending authorization to enter Gaza.”","['Ibrahim Dahman', 'Dana Karni', 'Ivana Kottasová', 'Eyad Kourdi']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages-trump-intl/index.html,‘We are in no man’s land:’ Families of Gaza hostages pin their hopes on Trump,2025-03-15 11:58:10,"Nimrod Cohen’s mother never got to ask him why he chose a raven for the tattoo he got in October 2023. Three days after getting inked, Nimrod was kidnapped and taken to Gaza.
The next time Cohen saw that bird was more than 500 days later, in a Hamas propaganda video.
“We recognized Nimrod because of that tattoo. Otherwise, I wouldn’t recognize him because you couldn’t hear his voice or see his face,” Vicky Cohen told CNN.
“It was the first time we got a visual sign of life of Nimrod and I was so excited to see him standing, moving his body, the first time that we can see him after so long. It makes Nimrod more present and it makes Nimrod more alive, and it also makes me more worried and afraid.”
Nimrod Cohen is one of 24 hostages held in Gaza who are believed to be alive. As a young, healthy man with no children, Cohen has not been prioritized for release by Israeli negotiators, who insisted that women and children, the elderly and any injured hostages were freed first.
But for Vicky Cohen, there is no higher priority in the world than getting her son back. “I’m frightened and very worried but I’m not losing hope. I cannot lose hope. But also, I do believe that our government is not doing enough to bring him back,” she said.
Nimrod Cohen is among a handful of living hostages who were active-duty soldiers when abducted, alongside Edan Alexander, Matan Angrest and Tamir Nimrod. Hamas is also holding the bodies of several other soldiers, most of whom were killed during the October 7 terror attack.
Under the phased deal to which Israel and Hamas agreed in January, younger male hostages were going to be released during the latter stages of the ceasefire.
But they are now caught in limbo as the first phase of the deal expired without the two sides agreeing on what’s next.
Edan Alexander is the last of the American hostages in Gaza who is believed to be alive. The bodies of four more American citizens – Judi Weinstein Haggai and her husband Gad Haggai, and soldiers Itay Chan and Omer Maxim Neutra – are also still held by Hamas.
A senior Hamas official told CNN on Friday that the group was still committed to the initial deal and that it had accepted a proposal from mediators to release Alexander and the bodies of four dead dual national hostages, conditional on Israel abiding by terms laid down in the January ceasefire.
The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office accused Hamas of engaging in “manipulation” and “psychological warfare” by announcing their willingness to release Alexander. Israeli ministers will meet on Saturday night to receive a detailed report from a negotiating team that spent the past week in Doha, and “to decide on the next steps for the release of the hostages.”
Adi Alexander, Edan’s father, has spent the past year and half lobbying for the release of his son and all of the other hostages. He said he and his wife have attended more than 300 meetings with American officials.
“Somehow everybody feels really comfortable with the current ceasefire – Israelis and Hamas as well. There are no civilian deaths, which is great, no soldiers are dying, bullets are not flying, which is also great,” Alexander told CNN.
“But what about the hostages? We don’t want to go back into the situation with Gilad Shalit (whom) they kept for years and at the end of the day, the demands were the same – so the Israelis need to get out of this comfort zone and keep negotiating.”
Gilad Shalit is a former IDF soldier who was held by Hamas in Gaza for more than five years. He was released in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners.
Trump’s ultimatum
Earlier this year, Israel and Hamas agreed to a phased ceasefire that would consist of three distinct stages. The initial phase of the truce ended in mid-February, after 38 hostages were freed from Gaza and 1,737 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released from Israeli prisons.
The second phase was meant to include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the release of all remaining living hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The details of how this would unfold were meant to be agreed during the first phase of the agreement, but that has not happened.
“What’s happening now, exactly? What is the plan? It obviously never went by the original plan to start negotiating after 16 days and be over with that within two weeks, we are far beyond that in this point, so what is the strategy?,” Alexander said.
“We are in no man’s land, leaving hostages under the ground, which is unacceptable.”
The Israeli government has suggested an extension to the first stage, demanding the release of half of the remaining Israeli living and deceased hostages in Gaza but without committing to end the war or withdraw Israeli troops. In return, Israel would release more Palestinian prisoners and detainees and allow more aid into the territory. According to this plan, the rest of the hostages would be released when, or if, an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure from his far-right coalition partners to return to war. Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, has threatened to withdraw from the government if Israel doesn’t restart the war. Itamar Ben Gvir quit his post as national security minister over the ceasefire.
Smotrich and Ben Gvir have argued that Israel should keep fighting Hamas until the group is “eliminated,” after which they want Israel to take over Gaza and build settlements there – an idea lent credence by US President Donald Trump, but dismissed by most other leaders.
Vicky Cohen said that she believes the Israeli government has prioritized the goal of defeating Hamas completely over the release of hostages, including her son.
“After more than one year of war, Hamas is still ruling Gaza. I understand the need (to stop) Hamas from ruling Gaza, so we won’t get to October 7 once again … but we need to pay a price and now, the main thing is to bring the hostages back home, even though it means to stop the war and withdraw from Gaza and deal with Hamas later on,” she said, adding that the idea of building Jewish settlements in Gaza was “nonsense.”
To put extra pressure on Hamas, Israel announced earlier this month that it would stop the entry of all humanitarian aid and electricity into Gaza.
The families of hostages still in Gaza are now pinning their hopes on Trump, who has sent US officials to negotiate directly with Hamas, in a notable U-turn from a long-standing policy of not talking to groups it considers terrorist organizations.
“We hear from the president that he is committed to bring all the hostages back, and we trust him, and we believe that’s what he is going to do – not because he loves the hostages, but because the wants to stop the war between a Russian and Ukraine crime and in Gaza, he wants to get a Nobel Prize of Peace,” Cohen said.
Earlier this month, Trump went as far as issuing what he said was a “last warning” to Hamas to release all hostages immediately, saying that “not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.”
While Hamas said Trump’s words threatened to undermine the ceasefire, Adi Alexander said he had faith in Trump. Alexander is the only one of the five American hostages in Gaza, to be alive.
“People need to take him seriously, sometimes not literally, but they need to take him really seriously,” he told CNN. “That’s the way it works. You have to shake the tree, create chaos, and the chaos will create opportunities.”
But Trump’s plan has not worked – at least not yet.
Instead, the US came up with a new proposal this week to extend the ceasefire in exchange for the release of a handful of living hostages.
The development was met with dismay by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which said reports of the proposal “raise serious concerns among the families of the hostages that their loved ones will be left in captivity for a long and unknown period.”
“We demand a comprehensive and immediate agreement that will return all 59 hostages in one fell swoop and leave no one behind,” the forum added in a statement.
Vicky Cohen said she has publicly turned to Netanyahu and other officials to “beg him to do the right thing.”
“There are people are still alive there, and even though Nimrod is a soldier, he is only 20 years old, and he is my son. I want to hug him. I want him back home. I miss the all the small things of life, hearing his voice, seeing his smile, seeing the mess in his room, and the empty packets of ice cream he leaves behind,” she said.

Sign up here.
Just hours after Islamist rebels ousted longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood at edge of the occupied Golan Heights and looked out over Syria. The historic downfall will create “very important opportunities” for Israel, he said in a video message.
As Syria plunged into chaos after Assad’s fall – its war-ravaged people grappling with an uncertain future and its ethnic and religious minorities wary of the new leadership’s jihadist history – Netanyahu’s government saw an opportunity to advance his quest to reshape the Middle East, one that envisions splitting Syria into smaller autonomous regions.
“A stable Syria can only be a federal Syria that includes different autonomies and respects different ways of life,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told European leaders at a meeting in Brussels last month.
Since Hamas’ October 7 attack and ensuing regional conflicts, Netanyahu has repeatedly boasted about “changing the face of the Middle East” in Israel’s favor. He views the developments in Syria as a direct result of Israel’s actions and is now seizing the opportunity to expand territorial control and establish zones of influence by seeking alliances with minority groups in Syria’s peripheries.
In the days that followed Assad’s ouster, Netanyahu ordered an unprecedented ground push into Syria, driving Israeli forces deeper into the country than ever before and upending Israel’s 50-year tacit détente with the Assads.
The escalation quickly abandoned Netanyahu’s initial pledge to practice “good neighborliness” to the new Syria. Hundreds of airstrikes targeted the remnants of Assad’s military to prevent them from falling into the hands of militant groups, and Israeli forces seized Mount Hermon, Syria’s highest peak, and a strategically vital position overlooking Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. On Monday, Israel targeted radar sites and military command centers in southern Syria, and on Thursday, it targeted Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Syrian capital Damascus.
Israel has vowed to continue, with an Israeli official telling CNN that the country won’t allow the new Syrian regime’s forces to deploy in southern Syria, seeing them as a threat to Israeli citizens.
Shifting border
Israel’s border with Syria had remained largely unchanged since the 1967 war, when it occupied and later annexed the Golan Heights from Syria in a move rejected by most of the international community but endorsed by US President Donald Trump during his first term. But Israel’s recent actions in Syria have blurred the lines of that border as it takes more territory. Israel has never fully demarcated its borders with its neighbors.
For half a century, Hafez al-Assad and his son, Bashar, ruled Syria ruthlessly, enduring wars, rebellions, and uprisings while stoking sectarian fears to deter calls for change. The younger Assad avoided direct confrontation with Israel but provided its archenemy, Iran, with key supply routes to Tehran’s armed proxy groups, most notably Hezbollah in Lebanon, which fired thousands of rockets at Israel during the Israel-Hamas war.
Syria’s new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa – formerly known by his nom du guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and once linked to Al-Qaeda – ousted Assad in a Turkish-backed lightning offensive before assuming power in December. Shedding traditional attire and military fatigues, he adopted a suit and tie, repeatedly telling foreign news outlets that he had no interest in confronting Israel.
“He thought he could court Israel in the sense of reassuring it that there would be no violence along its border and no fight with Israel… but Israel is emboldened by the last year-and-a-half, and with the support of the Trump administration is looking for greater ambition,” Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, said.
Israeli officials now say there will be an Israeli military presence in Syria “indefinitely” and have called for the protection of Syria’s Druze and Kurdish people, significant minorities living in Syria’s south and northeast respectively. The Druze populate three main provinces close to the Israeli-occupied Golan heights in the south of the country.
“Jolani (Sharaa) took off his galabiya (robe), put on a suit, and presented a moderate face – now he has removed the mask and revealed his true identity: a jihadist terrorist from the Al-Qaida school, committing atrocities against the civilian population,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said last week after forces loyal to Sharaa killed hundreds of members of the Alawite minority in response to an attempt by supporters of Assad to take control of cities near Syria’s Mediterranean coast.
The slaughter, which claimed more than 800 people on both sides, underscored the danger to Sharaa’s fragile regime as regional players intensify efforts to forge alliances with different communities within Syria.
If Israel succeeds in creating a demilitarized zone in Syria with the backing of local Druze residents, it will bring large parts of the country’s south under Israeli influence, representing Israel’s most significant territorial control in Syria since its founding.
“There is a real danger that eventually that will kick in to create a spiral of escalation,” Charles Lister, a senior fellow and head of the Syria Initiative at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, told CNN. “The (Syrian) interim government has done nothing in response to all these Israeli actions.”
If that changes, “all hell can break loose,” he added.
In recent weeks, Sharaa has taken a harsher stance on Israel’s moves, condemning its advances as “hostile expansionism” while moving to reconcile with the very minorities Israel has courted.
A day after the bloody violence on the coast over the weekend, Sharaa signed a landmark agreement with Kurdish-led forces to integrate them into state institutions, and is reportedly close to signing a similar deal with the Druze in southern Syria.
Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said that Israel’s actions are driven by its concern that Syria’s unrest and instability will spill over into its territory.
“What motivates Israel is the fear (of) the emergence of an Islamist regime near our border that is hostile to Israel… they decided not to count on what’s going on right now but to make sure that if a threat were to emerge it will be there to curtail it,” Valensi told CNN. “The prevalent perception in Israel is that we shouldn’t rely on the pragmatism that Sharaa is demonstrating so far, and that we should be prepared for the negative scenario.”
Courting Syria’s minorities
As Netanyahu seeks to expand Israel’s influence in Syria, he has singled out Syria’s Druze for protection, seeking to ally with a religious minority that could become disenfranchised by Syria’s new Islamist rulers.
Netanyahu and Katz instructed the Israeli military earlier this month to “prepare to defend” the Druze in Syria and said that Israel “will not allow the extremist Islamic regime in Syria to harm” the group. Syrian Druze may also be allowed to work in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
The Druze, an ethnic Arab group following an offshoot of Islam, also have a significant presence in Israel and the Golan Heights. Although most Golan Druze identify as Syrian Arabs and reject the Israeli state, some have accepted Israeli citizenship. In Israel, Druze citizens are required to serve in the military – unlike their Muslim and Christian Arab compatriots.
Many members of the Syrian Druze community have rejected Netanyahu’s offer for support since the fall of Assad. Crowds took to the streets of Suwayda, a Druze majority Syrian city, to protest his call to demilitarize southern Syria and regional leaders representing the group accused Israel of expansionary goals.
Walid Jumblatt, a Lebanese Druze leader who is widely respected by Druze outside Lebanon, warned about Israel’s ambitions last week.
“Israel wants to use tribes, sects and religions for its own benefit. It wants to fragment the region,” he told a news conference in Beirut Sunday. The Druze “should be careful,” he added.
However, some community members, worried that Sharaa may impose strict Islamic rule in Syria, have privately welcomed Netanyahu’s offer, seeing it as a guarantee for protection in an uncertain future, a local activist and a journalist told CNN. In the wake of Netanyahu’s comments, a few thousand Druze members formed an armed faction called the Military Council, they said.
The group “barely registers on a scale of relevance,” Lister said. “There is a very, very small faction in Suwayda that appear to be hinting at the idea that they would be open to some kind of external protection.”
Israel also sees Syria’s Kurds as a potential ally and has called for them to be protected against a Turkish military campaign. Turkey blames Syria’s Kurdish militants of being linked the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a militant separatist group in Turkey.
“The problem with creating alliances with non-Sunni Muslim minorities or non-Arab minorities is that most Syrians actually want to have unity, so I think Israel will continue try to create tension… because Israel was so outward in its ambitions that it has had an opposite effect and created a moment of unity amongst Syrians,” Hall said.
Spheres of influence
While Israel’s moves in Syria may have been the most visible, it is not the only regional or global player that has sought to expand its influence there.
Turkey, which had long opposed the Assad regime and pushed for his ouster, plans to sign a defense pact with Sharaa that could see the deployment of fighter jets in two bases in central Syria.
“Turkey does have plans with Damascus’ permission to occupy at least two major airbases in central Syria, deploy fighter jets into Syria in order to exert some semblance of Syrian sovereignty,” Lister said. “Of course that is directed at Israel.”
Saudi Arabia, where al-Sharaa was born and spent his early years, deployed a royal jet last month to transport him to Riyadh for meetings with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a bold gesture that underscored the kingdom’s intent to reassert its dominance in the region while signaling the decline of Iran’s once-formidable sway over Syria.
Meanwhile, Russia, which was pivotal in keeping Assad in power in exchange for a strategic military presence on the Mediterranean, has now lost its foothold in Syria. Reuters reported last month that amid Trump’s lack of clarity on Syria and concern over Turkey’s growing influence, Israel is lobbying the US to let Russia keep its military bases there in an effort to keep the country weak and decentralized. CNN could not confirm the report.
“If any other force in Syria today believes that Israel will permit other hostile forces to use Syria as a base of operations against us, they are gravely mistaken,” Netanyahu said in a news conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/travel/air-canada-apologizes-israel-erased-map-planes/index.html,Air Canada apologizes after Israel erased from the map on some of its planes,2019-03-13 00:00:00,"Air Canada has apologized after it emerged that some of its fleet displayed maps that appeared to have erased Israel.
The carrier’s Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name “Palestinian territories.” The maps have been deactivated while they are updated.
The discrepancy was first noticed by a passenger who flagged it to the company. Air Canada said in a statement that it was found on 40 of its Boeing 737 aircraft. According to the airline’s website, there are 43 737 MAX twinjets in the fleet of more than 350 total aircraft.
The IFE in question had been produced by French aerospace group Thales, while the map itself had been produced for Thales by an external company, which has not been named.
Air Canada and Thales said in a joint statement, shared with CNN on Thursday, that the issue had been “resolved.”
“It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,” the statement said. “Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy.”
The map function was immediately disabled on the aircraft, it added, and the airline has been working with Thales and the map provider to reprogram the planes. A rectified map will be installed on the fleet from March 14.
“Air Canada and Thales apologize for the unease created by this situation,” it concluded.
Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.
“Thales is working closely with the airline and the involved third-party to remediate this regrettable issue as soon possible,” they said.
It’s not the first time the issue has raised its head in aviation.
In 2024, JetBlue apologized after a similar issue with its moving map. The airline said it was switching to another moving map provider, and had asked the old one to “adjust [the map] so that it aligns with the US government’s map guidance for the region.” British Airways had a similar incident in 2013.",['Julia Buckley'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/middleeast/trump-gaza-relocation-comments-intl/index.html,"Trump says ‘nobody is expelling Palestinians,’ weeks after saying they should be moved to Arab states",2025-03-12 00:00:00,"US President Donald Trump’s plans for the future of Gaza were further shrouded in confusion on Wednesday when he told reporters that “nobody is expelling any Palestinians” from the enclave – an apparent climbdown from his previous proclamations that its population should be relocated.
Trump has repeatedly offered conflicting visions for Gaza’s future. He said in recent weeks that its 2.1 million Palestinians should be moved to Arab states like Egypt and Jordan following Israel’s war with Hamas, controversially proposing that the US take control of the Strip and turn it into a Middle Eastern “Riviera.”
“We’re moving them to a beautiful location where they have new homes, where they can live safely, where they’ll have doctors and medical and all of those things,” he said during a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan last month. “And I think it’s going to be great.”
But during a Wednesday meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, Trump responded to a reporter’s question about his plan by saying: “Nobody’s expelling any Palestinians.”
It’s unclear whether Trump’s comments translated to an actual shift in US foreign policy, as the US president has made a series of contradictory comments about his administration’s plans for Gaza.
After receiving forceful pushback from Egyptian and Jordanian leaders about his vision for Gaza without Palestinians, Trump said it was merely a suggestion.
“The way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it,” he told Fox News last month.
Then, after Arab nations endorsed a long-awaited plan for Gaza’s reconstruction in early March, the Trump administration rejected it, with National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes saying the Arab proposal “does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.”
Trump’s latest statement was cautiously welcomed by Hamas.
Hazem Qasem, a Hamas spokesperson, told CNN on Thursday that Trump’s statement is welcomed if it represents a “reversal of the idea of displacing the people of the Gaza strip.”
Egypt’s foreign ministry and the Palestine Liberation Organization meanwhile said they appreciated Trump’s statements.”
Trump’s previous comments about taking control of Gaza had appalled Palestinians. The president, a former real estate magnate, has described Gaza as a “demolition site” that would be “leveled out” and “fixed up.”
“I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people — the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza — to go back yet another time, and we don’t want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it and we’ll slowly — very slowly, we’re in no rush — develop it. We’re going to bring stability to the Middle East soon,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One last month.
Trump first raised the proposal during a joint press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month.
Netanyahu has since described Trump’s plan as a “revolutionary, creative vision.”
Israel’s war with Hamas has destroyed homes, businesses and infrastructure in virtually every part of the Strip. It has also killed nearly 50,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry.","['Rob Picheta', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Kareem El Damanhoury']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/middleeast/us-israel-hamas-new-gaza-ceasefire-proposal-intl-latam/index.html,"US envoy gives Israel and Hamas new proposal to extend Gaza ceasefire, says source",2025-03-10 00:00:00,"The United States has put forward a new proposal that would secure the release of a handful of living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a month-long extension of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, a source familiar with the negotiations said.
The exact number of living and dead hostages to be released by Hamas during the extended ceasefire, as well as the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel, remained the subject of negotiations, the source said.
Under the US proposal, which was presented this week in Qatar by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Israel would also lift its blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been ongoing for nearly two weeks, the source said.
The ceasefire extension would run until the end of Passover, extending the pause in fighting and renewing the entry of humanitarian aid through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday.
When asked about the proposal, a State Department spokesperson said they would not comment on ongoing negotiations.
Asked for comment on reports of progress in the negotiations, Hamas spokesman Basem Naim said: “Things are at a standstill.”
The Israeli Prime Minister’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
The latest US proposal marked a reduction from its previous proposal in the number of hostages to be released by Hamas during the same time period, drawing swift concern from the families of the hostages.
“The publications about the outline for the return of only a few hostages raise serious concerns among the families of the hostages that their loved ones will be left in captivity for a long and unknown period,” the Hostages and Missing Families’ Forum said in a statement.
“We demand a comprehensive and immediate agreement that will return all 59 hostages in one fell swoop and leave no one behind,” it added.
Of the 59 hostages still being held in Gaza, fewer than half are still believed to be alive.

This is the first time the military has acknowledged that there is “reasonable suspicion” to believe soldiers forced civilians to take part in military operations.
CNN has reported on Israeli soldiers forcing civilians in Gaza to enter potentially booby-trapped houses and tunnels in order to avoid putting troops in harm’s way.
“In several cases, the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division opened investigations after reasonable suspicion arose regarding the use of Palestinians for military missions during the operations,” the IDF said.
The military would not confirm how many investigations had been opened, nor who was being investigated.
“Those investigations are still ongoing, and accordingly, other details cannot be provided at this time,” the IDF said.
In an interview with CNN late last year, an Israeli soldier said his unit had forced a Palestinian man to enter a building ahead of troops. “If there are any booby traps, they will explode and not us,” he explained.
The practice was reportedly so common in the Israeli military that it had a name: “mosquito protocol.”
The exact scale and scope of the practice by the Israeli military is not known. But the testimony of both the soldier and five civilians last year indicated that it was widespread across the territory: in northern Gaza, Gaza City, Khan Younis and Rafah.
One of the civilians, Mohammad Saad, age 20, told CNN that IDF soldiers had detained him in Rafah.
“They would ask us to do things like, ‘move this carpet,’ saying they were looking for tunnels,” he said. “‘Film under the stairs,’ they would say. If they found something, they would tell us to bring it outside. For example, they would ask us to remove belongings from the house, clean here, move the sofa, open the fridge, and open the cupboard.”
At the time of CNN’s report, in October, the IDF said that military protocols “strictly prohibit the use of detained Gaza civilians for military operations.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/middleeast/israel-freedom-of-speech-crackdown-intl/index.html,Israel’s pivot to the right brings unprecedented crackdown on freedom of speech,2025-02-10 00:00:00,"Mahmoud Muna looked on in disbelief as plain-clothes Israeli police officers rifled the shelves in his decades-old bookstore in occupied East Jerusalem.
The officers were looking for books they deemed “inciteful,” and in the process detained him and his nephew, Ahmad, for 48 hours.
The February raid on two branches of the Educational Bookshop – a well-known bookstore popular among Palestinians, Israelis and foreigners – was a widening of what critics describe as a crackdown on free speech in Israel that has intensified since Hamas’ October 7 attack.
Witnesses to the raid said police were looking for any book containing the word “Palestine,” a Palestinian flag, its colors, or any symbol of Palestinian national or political identity.
Israel’s police said at the time that they conducted the raid because the stores were “suspected of selling books containing incitement and support for terrorism.” On Tuesday, they raided the shop again, detaining Mahmoud’s father, and the shop’s co-owner, Imad.
“You could be… running one of the most international bookshops of the city, and within the 30 minutes, you are in a dungeon underground in a detention center, and everyone is shoving and kicking you, and you have very little rights whatsoever,” Muna, a Palestinian from Jerusalem, told CNN before the second raid from his home, where he was under house arrest at the time.
Muna spent two days in custody and was under house arrest for five days, after which he was not allowed to be in his bookshop for another two weeks. The charges against him were downgraded from incitement to “disrupting public order,” he says.
During Tuesday’s raid, Ahmad Muna said police confiscated books by Noam Chomsky, as well as historians Ilan Pappé and Rashid Khalidi.
The raids have alarmed not only Israeli activists but also Israelis in general. Critics warn it sets a dangerous precedent in a country whose prime minister calls it the “only democracy in the Middle East.” They argue that voices critical of Israel’s war in Gaza – and the staggering death toll it has caused – are increasingly being silenced through intimidation and legal action.
“What happened in the bookstore… should be a red light, a very strong red light for all of us,” said Gideon Levy, a veteran Israeli journalist who was once a prominent voice in Israel’s left but has become increasingly marginalized in the national discourse. He is often seen on international news channels but now says he is no longer invited to give interviews on Israeli television.
“In Israel, there is a government which is using anti-democratic means, not to say fascist means, against freedom of thought, freedom of speech, any kind of freedom. And they do it with pride,” he told CNN.
David Mencer, a spokesman at the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, has said that “any measures which are taken are always taken within the framework of Israeli law, with all the appropriate checks and balances from our democracy.”
“We will maintain freedom of speech under the rule of law,” Mencer said in a press briefing in response to CNN’s question.
‘Systematic political persecution’
Critics however say Israeli authorities’ attempt to police speech have expanded in scope since October 7.
Leftist politician Ofer Cassif is the only Jewish lawmaker in the Arab-majority Hadash-Ta’al party in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Lawmakers tried but failed to expel him from parliament last year after he signed a petition of support for South Africa’s genocide case against Israel for its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 people, according to the health ministry there. Israel vehemently denies charges of genocide. In November, the parliamentary ethics committee suspended Cassif from the Knesset for six months, allowing him to enter the chamber only to cast votes.
“There is an ongoing, profound, systematic political persecution of anyone who raises an alternative voice to the government, of anyone who raises a voice,” he said. “And the stronger it is, the stronger is the persecution.”
Still, Cassif maintains that there are “thousands and thousands” of “democratic Jews like myself” in the country, but says they are being increasingly marginalized.
Levy’s newspaper, Haaretz, has also been targeted. In November, the Israeli cabinet unanimously voted to ban the government from interacting with the paper, citing its critical coverage of the war in Gaza and comments by its publisher calling for sanctions on senior government officials.
The paper described the government’s move as an attempt to “silence a critical, independent newspaper.”
Levy says the events of October 7 were so devastating for the nation that they pushed more Jewish Israelis toward the right – with suspicion of Palestinians and Arab Israelis growing ever deeper.
Some among Israel’s Jewish intellectuals, he says, had “lost some of their humanity” since the attacks, referring to a lack of sympathy for Gazans’ suffering in the war.
“Some will tell you that after the 7th of October, we have the right to do whatever we want,” Levy said. “That’s the mindset of Israel today.”
The perceived crackdown on freedom of speech has sent shockwaves through the Arab-Israeli community and the shrinking group of Jewish Israeli intellectuals who are still speaking out for Palestinian rights.
In October, Israeli police barred a theater in Jaffa from screening a film about Israel’s takeover of the Palestinian town of Lyd during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, citing a lack of permit, according to Israeli media. The literary and free expression advocacy group PEN America urged a reversal of the ban, describing it as “the latest in an ongoing effort by the Israeli government to suppress Palestinian voices.”
In August, police barred another film, “Jenin, Jenin 2,” from being shown in Jaffa, saying it amounted to incitement, according to Channel 12 The movie is a sequel to the 2002 film, “Jenin Jenin,” which is banned. In 2022, the Israeli Supreme Court upheld the ban and ordered the director to pay a fine to a military officer for defamation.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli Ministry of Culture and Sport for comment on restrictions on film screenings.
Mencer says that while Israel upholds the freedom to criticize the government, it won’t tolerate incitement. “In Israel, there is a distinction between criticism and incitement. Criticism of the government will never be silenced.”
“There will always be national security concerns, of course, as there are in all countries, especially at a time of war… Israel will always ensure that speech does not incite violence or support terrorist organizations,” he said.
Levy says he no longer takes for granted that he will be able to continue to write with freedom to criticize the country’s policies “because this government has an agenda, and this agenda is to try as much as they can to shut mouths and to close any criticism.”
David Issacharoff, also a Haaretz journalist, says his newspaper being targeted by “the most far-right government in Israel’s history” is a “badge of honor,” as it shows “we might be probably doing the right thing.” If writers remain silent or leave the country, “they win,” he says, referring to radicals on the Israeli right.
He is even more determined to continue writing in the face of the sanctions, saying it is important to show the world that “there is a different side to Israel than people would think. People who are against war crimes, people who are for human rights, people who want peace.”
But he warns that the crackdown on free speech may be reaching a point of no return.
“A Rubicon is being crossed at the moment,” he said, “with the raid on the bookstore and more broadly, the pressures that are being put on you, the pressures that are being put on other broadcasters, the pressures that are being put on cultural events, on movies, on theaters and things like that.”
“We are way past a place where we could say that Israel is a democratic state,” he said.
For Cassif, the lawmaker, it’s already too late for freedom of speech in Israel. “It’s not even at stake anymore. It doesn’t exist,” he said.
Muna, the bookshop owner, worries what the restrictions will mean for coming generations.
“You are creating a whole generation that their ability to think will not be beyond that framework that has been set by the government,” he said. “This is very dangerous, very, very dangerous.”","['Kareem Khadder', 'Nic Robertson', 'Nadeen Ebrahim']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/09/middleeast/israel-electricity-gaza-intl-latam/index.html,Israel cuts electricity to last facility in Gaza receiving Israeli power,2025-03-09 15:54:48,"Israel says it has cut the flow of electricity to the last facility in Gaza that was still receiving power from the Israel Electric Corporation.
“I just signed an order for the immediate halt of electricity to the Gaza Strip,” Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen said in a statement, adding that the country would “operate all of the tools that are at our disposal, to ensure the return of all the hostages.”
Israel cut off electricity supplies to Gaza following the Hamas’ attacks of October 7, 2023, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, but the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) had since reconnected power to a wastewater treatment facility following a government directive.
A spokesperson for the IEC confirmed to CNN that, “Today, a directive was received to disconnect the (electricity) to the facility, and this was done.”
Israel’s decision will intensify the enclave’s existing water crisis, with the cutoff severely impacting desalination efforts, local officials said.
“There is already water scarcity, and the position of the Israeli government will intensify this crisis in Gaza Strip,” the mayor of Gaza municipality Asem Al Nabih told CNN Monday. “Cutting off the electricity (to) Gaza will increase the need for water, especially drinking water.”
The last working desalination plant in Gaza had already been relying mostly on diesel generators or solar panels for power before Israel announced it was cutting the remaining power supply to Gaza, but the decision will still have a severe impact on desalination efforts in the enclave, according to the mayor of the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, Nizar Ayyash.
“In addition to our severed supply line, there will be a 70% reduction in the amount of desalinated water suitable for drinking in the central region and the south,” Ayyash explained.
But Hamas’ spokesperson Hazem Qassem suggested the move would have little practical effect given the earlier cutoffs. However, he criticized it as “behavior that confirms the occupation’s intent to continue its genocidal war against Gaza, through the use of starvation policies, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.”
Since Israel launched its war on Hamas in Gaza in response to the October 7 attacks, Gazans have relied largely on generators and solar power for electricity.
Far-right Israeli politician Itamar Ben Gvir welcomed the energy ministry’s latest move, and urged the government to go even further, by targeting the fuel that had entered the enclave following the ceasefire and hostages deal agreed between Israel and Hamas.
“The Gaza Strip must be completely and immediately blacked out as long as even one Israeli hostage is being held there,” he said. “Israel must bomb the huge fuel depots that entered the Strip as part of the unfortunate deal, as well as the generators operated by Hamas.”
The news comes even as talks over the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas take place.
Last week, Israel announced it would stop the entry of all humanitarian aid into the enclave to pressure Hamas into accepting new terms for an extension of the ceasefire agreement after the initial phase of the truce expired.
Israel wants to extend the first phase of the deal to continue the exchange of hostages, alive and deceased, in return for the continued release of Palestinian prisoners and the flow of higher volumes of aid into Gaza – but without any commitment to permanently ending the war. Hamas has insisted on moving forward with the second phase of the ceasefire deal, which involves negotiations for a permanent end to the war in Gaza.
A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Friday to discuss the ceasefire deal and to push for a potential second phase of the agreement, while Israel said Saturday it had “accepted an invitation” from US-backed mediators to send an Israeli delegation to Doha on Monday, “in an effort to advance the negotiations.”
An Israeli source told CNN that Israel was “giving negotiations a chance” before it returns to fighting in Gaza.
US President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostages Adam Boehler expressed optimism Sunday about a potential truce between Israel and Hamas following direct talks with the militant group this week.
“I think something could come together within weeks. I will say that I believe there is enough there to make a deal between what Hamas wants and what they’ve accepted and what Israel wants and it’s accepted. And I think there is a deal where they can get all of the prisoners out, not just the Americans,” Boehler told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
Fifty-nine hostages are thought to remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are thought to be dead, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. Five of the 59 are American Israelis, only one of whom – Edan Alexander – is still alive.
On Sunday, senior Hamas official Taher Al Nunu was quoted by Al Aqsa TV – a channel affiliated to the militant group – as saying that it did not oppose releasing Alexander as part of negotiations to end the war.
Hamas had related that message to US officials during recent talks focused on implementing an interim agreement aimed at ending the war, Al Nunu said.","['Lauren Izso', 'Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Abeer Salman']",en

The Israeli and her homestay operator were stargazing along with three male travelers, an American and two Indians, in Koppal town in southern Karnataka state on Thursday night, police official Ram L. Arasiddi said.
According to an initial investigation, three men on a motorbike approached them while asking for money. Following arguments, the three men pushed the male travelers into a nearby water canal and sexually assaulted the women, Arasiddi said. One of the Indian tourists drowned and his body was recovered on Saturday. The American and another Indian swam to safety.
Koppal is about 350 kilometers (217 miles) from Bengaluru, India’s startup and technology powerhouse.
Arasiddi said police set up a special investigation team that arrested two out of the three suspects on Saturday. They were being investigated on suspicion of attempted murder, gang rape and robbery, he said.
The Associated Press generally doesn’t identify victims of sexual assault.
Sexual assaults on women have become familiar in India, where police recorded 31,516 rape cases in 2022, a 20% increase from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. The real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence and victims’ lack of faith in police.
Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the brutal 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties.
The rape law was amended in 2013, criminalizing stalking and voyeurism and lowering the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16. The government in 2018 approved the death penalty for people convicted of raping children under age 12.
Despite stringent laws, it’s rare for more than a few weeks to pass without another brutal sexual assault being reported.
High-profile cases involving foreign visitors have drawn international attention to the issue. Last year, in a video that was later deleted, a Spanish tourist said his wife was raped in northern India while an Indian-American woman said she was raped at a hotel in New Delhi. In 2022, a British tourist was raped in front of her partner in Goa.","['Story the Associated Press', 'the Associated Press']",en

The United Arab Emirates said it would seek immediate dismissal of the case, which it said lacked “any legal or factual basis,” a UAE official said in a statement to Reuters.
The charges are in connection with intense ethnic-based attacks by the RSF and allied Arab militias against the non-Arab Masalit tribe in 2023 in West Darfur, documented in detail by Reuters. Those attacks were determined to be genocide by the United States in January.
The Sudanese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters has seen a copy of the government’s application.
Sudanese officials have frequently accused the UAE of supporting the RSF, the government’s rivals in an almost two-year-old civil war, charges the UAE denies but U.N. experts and U.S. lawmakers have found credible.
At the ICJ, Sudan alleges the RSF committed “genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violation of human rights,” according to a statement by the ICJ, also known as the World Court.
“According to Sudan, all such acts have been ‘perpetrated and enabled by the direct support given to the rebel RSF militia and related militia groups by the United Arab Emirates,’” it said.
The UAE official said: “The UAE is aware of the recent application by the Sudanese Armed Force’s representative to the International Court of Justice, which is nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt aimed at diverting attention from the established complicity of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the widespread atrocities that continue to devastate Sudan and its people.”
The UAE maintains that it is committed to addressing the humanitarian crisis and has “consistently called for an immediate ceasefire” in Sudan, in a statement.
The war between the Sudanese army and the RSF, which erupted after a power struggle over integrating the forces in April 2023, has devastated the country, spreading hunger and disease while risking its fragmentation, and has drawn in several foreign powers.
It has sparked ethnic attacks in multiple areas, but the bloodiest were in West Darfur, where survivors told Reuters that Masalit boys were targeted for killing while young women were targeted for rapes over waves of attacks soon after the war began.
The ICJ is the U.N.’s highest court that deals with disputes between states and violations of international treaties. Sudan and the UAE are both signatories of the 1948 Genocide Convention.
Sudan is asking the court to impose emergency measures and to order the Emirates to prevent such genocidal acts.
While a hearing on the emergency measures should come before the ICJ within weeks, it will take years before the court will issue a final ruling which could determine if a genocide had been committed in Darfur.
The RSF and allied political groups are in the process of setting up a parallel government to the army-aligned one which has taken Port Sudan on the Red Sea, a move rejected by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/middleeast/israel-hamas-talks-analysis-intl/index.html,Hamas and the US are talking for the first time. So what does the Palestinian militant group want?,2025-03-06 17:02:39,"For most of the past 17 months, the idea of a political settlement to the war in Gaza, much less the Israel-Palestinian conflict, has appeared far from reality – eclipsed by a devastating military campaign that has killed tens of thousands, and black and white rhetoric.
Hamas members are “sick and twisted,” in the words of US President Donald Trump. The only option, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly pledged, is to “eliminate” the militant group – his oft-vaunted “total victory.”
And yet on Wednesday it emerged that the US president may be willing to settle for something far more practical: His government is breaking with its longstanding policy of not talking with groups it deems to be terrorist organizations.
“The special envoy who’s engaged in those negotiations does have the authority to talk to anyone,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters Wednesday. “These are ongoing talks and discussions.”
Beyond Trump’s rhetoric of expelling Palestinians from Gaza and taking over the enclave, it appears as though the US government wants to hear what Hamas might want in exchange for the release of 59 hostages it still holds. Only one American still believed to be alive, Edan Alexander, remains in Gaza. The group also holds four dead Americans.
Previous talks have all been held through the intermediaries of Qatar and Egypt.
Hamas, which grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, was founded in the late 1980s and is dedicated to resisting the Israeli state. It had long advocated for the destruction of Israel, but in 2017 said that it was prepared to accept a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem – inside the borders that existed before Israel captured large swaths of territory from Jordan, Egypt, and Syria.
Under international law, Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem are considered to be militarily occupied by the Israeli state.
A central goal of Israel’s devastating war on Gaza has been to remove Hamas from power and to eliminate its ability to threaten Israel.
On at least that first point, Hamas’ leadership abroad has been increasingly clear that it is willing to step aside.
“We say clearly that it is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political or administrative arrangements in the next phase,” spokesperson Hazem Qassem told Al Arabiya last month.
When Arab leaders, scrambling to respond to Trump’s Gaza plan, proposed this week an interim coalition government for Gaza which would not include Hamas, the militant group quickly endorsed the plan.
Governance has become “a burden” for the group, Mkhaimar Abusada, a Palestinian politics professor who fled Gaza in November 2023, told CNN.
The mundane realities of providing schooling, healthcare, and basic municipal services is incompatible, he said, with resisting Israeli occupation. “Since they won the elections in 2006 and they took over the Gaza Strip in summer 2007, it has become obvious to Hamas that they cannot do both things,” he said.
The fact that so many of Hamas’ political leaders – who have for years live abroad in Qatar and Turkey – were unaware of the plan to attack Israel on October 7 speaks to the relative supremacy of resistance over governance within the movement.
But the central, unresolved issue is whether the group will disarm.
“I am aware that discussions on this matter are ongoing within Hamas’s leadership abroad, and opinions are divided,” Gershon Baskin, a veteran Israeli negotiator-turned-peace activist who has a long history of speaking with Hamas, said recently.
“There’s no one left from the political command of Hamas in Gaza today,” he told CNN on Thursday. “And we’re relying on these young people who are holding the hostages and delivered so far, but there could be rift developing between the political leadership of Hamas outside and the military leadership of Hamas inside of Gaza today. And that’s a very dangerous situation.”
Publicly, the group has been unequivocal. The idea that Hamas would lay down its arms is “a red line and is not up for discussion or negotiation,” Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesperson, said in a recent interview.
The reality may be a bit more complicated.
“Hamas are not lunatics,” said Hamzé Attar, a Palestinian journalist and defense analyst from Gaza who has lived abroad for more than a decade. “They know that there is a point where weapons mean nothing, and they will be more of an obstacle than a leverage.”
That point, however, will be hard for Netanyahu to stomach: a Palestinian state.
“For them it is inconceivable to ask Hamas to lay down their weapons or their arms before there is a meaningful political settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” Abusada said. “For them, according to international law, any occupied people – like the Ukrainians for example – have the right to defend themselves.”
The group is also very aware, analysts say, that any commitment to a state must be ironclad and backed by international actors such as Saudi Arabia, which has said that normalized diplomatic relations with Israel are conditional on Palestinian statehood.
Even before October 7, the Israeli prime minister paid only the most passing lip service to the two-state solution. Since then, he has steadfastly vowed that a state would be “a reward for terrorism.” He has endorsed Trump’s plan to encourage the emigration of all 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza, and his far-right coalition partners are readying their plans to re-establish Jewish settlements in the enclave.
Trump has proven over and again that he is willing to force longtime American allies into uncomfortable positions if he thinks it will benefit him.
His administration negotiated with the Taliban to withdraw Western forces from Afghanistan, leading to the eventual overthrow of the longtime American-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani.
Israel’s leaders are clearly nervous about what Trump might negotiate with Hamas. When it was revealed that the US was speaking with Hamas, the prime minister’s office released a terse statement that “Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas” – without saying what that position was.
The question now will be how far Trump is willing to go.
“The US has almost no leverage on Hamas and US threats against Hamas are almost useless,” Baskin said. “The US is not likely to bomb Gaza or to have US boots on the ground.”
The main danger, in his view, is that the US would give a green light to “further Israeli breaches of international law, such as cutting humanitarian supplies.” Israel denies breaching international law in Gaza.
“There is no deal without ending the war and without Israel exiting Gaza. There is no end to the war without all of the hostages being freed. There is no real end to the war if Hamas – militarily or politically – continues to control Gaza.”
Trump may tell Hamas’ leadership that “now is the time to leave Gaza,” but his national security advisers will surely be telling him that America believes that the militant group has recruited more members than it has lost fighting Israel.
A senior member of Hamas’ politburo, Osama Hamdan, said recently that the group has “an opportunity to expand,” and that any outside actor who comes into Gaza to do Israel’s bidding “will be treated like Israel.”
Israel’s new military chief warned this week that the country must prepare for a “prolonged multi-front war of attrition.”
That will not sit well with an American president who casts himself as a peacemaker.
“I understand that we are all still in a state of deep trauma,” Baskin said of his fellow Israelis. “I understand that the majority of Israelis today reject the idea of a Palestinian state. But the reality of more than 7 million Israeli Jews and more than 7 million Palestinian Arabs living on the land between the (Jordan) River and the (Mediterranean) Sea is much stronger and compelling than the current mood of Israeli public opinion.”",['Mick Krever'],en

Proper housing and basic infrastructure are nowhere to be found. Their family of 11 is living in a tent alongside heaps of concrete and mangled steel that now lie where their home once stood.
What they do have: flour, water and oil, which means Umm Muhammad can bake bread for her family.
But for how long?
“The food aid is what’s keeping us alive,” Umm Muhammad said. “We eat and drink for the whole month from aid. Without that, it will be very difficult… aid makes us live.”
That lifeline for Umm Muhammad and hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians is now under existential threat as Israel lays siege to Gaza once again.
The Israeli government announced Sunday that it was shutting down the supply of food and other humanitarian aid into Gaza in a bid to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and impose new conditions on the extension of the ceasefire, a day after the conclusion of the first phase of the deal.
“As of this morning, the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza will be prevented,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday, accusing Hamas of controlling “all of the supplies of goods that are being sent to the Gaza Strip” and “turning the humanitarian aid into a budget for terrorism directed against us.”
Hamas rejected those claims as “baseless lies.” Multiple humanitarian aid groups operating inside Gaza have said they distribute the aid they receive directly to those in need.
The United Nations and other aid groups accuse Israel of violating international law by blocking the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and say Israel is once again using starvation as a weapon of war, a charge Israel has denied. These same organizations have accused Israel of restricting or creating hurdles to the entry of aid throughout the war.
Twenty-five thousand trucks carrying food, hygiene supplies, tents and other necessities entered Gaza during the first six weeks of the ceasefire, stemming massive food insecurity and somewhat alleviating dire humanitarian conditions that had gripped Gaza.
Amid the rubble, families celebrating Ramadan have been able to put food on the table for the break-fast meal of Iftar. Markets had recently begun to come back to life. And regular aid distribution provided a thin safety net.
Israel’s decision to block aid into Gaza is already reverberating throughout the strip.
Food prices are already sharply rising in Gaza’s markets. And aid organizations are scrambling to ration minimal stockpiles of aid.
The World Food Programme said that bakeries and soup kitchens in Gaza could be forced to shut down in less than two weeks if more aid does not reach the strip.
Israel has threatened to take additional steps if Hamas does not agree to its demands, including cutting off electricity and water supplies to Gaza.
US-based group Human Rights Watch warned Thursday that Israel’s blockade would shut down most of the Palestinian territory’s water infrastructure within a week by starving it of fuel.
The specter of a return to war also now looms large, especially after US President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to give Israel the weapons it needs “to finish the job” in Gaza unless Hamas immediately releases all of the remaining hostages held there.
But for some in Gaza, Israel’s decision to block food aid into Gaza already amounts to a return to war.
“They are fighting us through our food,” Abu Muhammad said, standing atop a pile of rubble in Jabalya. “Netanyahu is now publicly saying ‘I will close the crossings and starve you.’ No one is standing against him.”
“Who is standing with us?” he asks. “We only have God – God is with us.”","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Tareq Al-Hilou', 'Abeer Salman']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/middleeast/israel-move-to-oust-attorney-general-gali-intl-latam/index.html,"Israel’s justice minister moves to oust attorney general amid allegations of political bias, opposition decries move",2025-03-05 21:12:15,"Israel’s Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Yariv Levin has initiated proceedings to dismiss the country’s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, accusing her of abusing her authority to undermine the government’s policies and destabilize Israel’s rule of law. Right-wing Israeli politicians have long called for her dismissal.
The controversial move, announced Wednesday, has prompted a fierce backlash from opposition leaders, who condemned it as an unconstitutional escalation amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
Baharav-Miara’s office has not yet publicly responded to the allegations. CNN has reached out to her office for comment.
Levin, a key ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, formally submitted a no-confidence motion against Baharav-Miara to the Cabinet Secretary alongside an 886-page dossier detailing allegations of misconduct.
The document, which includes a summary and letters to senior officials, accuses the attorney general of transforming her office into a “political entity” that obstructs government decisions, selectively enforces laws, and fuels societal divisions.
The Justice Ministry’s summary outlines several central claims, including that the attorney general’s role in Israel grants unparalleled influence compared to democratic counterparts in the rest of the world, enabling her to act as a “key political figure” rather than an impartial adviser.
Yair Lapid, head of the opposition, criticized Levin’s move as “criminal, violent, and unconstitutional,” accusing the justice minister of exploiting wartime divisions to consolidate power. “Levin, one of the main people responsible for the disaster of October 7, has learned nothing. He is harming the country, harming the rule of law, and harming the war effort,” Lapid said in a statement on Wednesday.
Critics claim the motion reflects what they say is a broader campaign by Netanyahu to weaken judicial oversight following a shelved judicial overhaul in July 2023 that sparked mass protests. Baharav-Miara, appointed in 2022, has frequently clashed with the government over its policies, including controversial judicial reforms and wartime decisions.
Levin’s office also announced the formation of a committee to select a new attorney general, signaling a push to expedite Baharav-Miara’s removal. The process, however, faces legal and political hurdles. Under Israeli law, dismissing the attorney general requires cabinet approval and a hearing, which opposition lawmakers pledge to challenge.
The move has deepened Israel’s political rift, with centrist and left-wing factions warning it jeopardizes democratic checks and balances. Supporters of the government, however, argue the attorney general’s office has overstepped its mandate, politicizing legal oversight.
Legal experts caution that Levin’s motion risks further polarizing institutions at a time of national crisis, with Israel embroiled in war and mounting international scrutiny over its Gaza campaign.
The attorney general’s role in Israel holds unique authority, serving as both the government’s legal adviser and a public watchdog. Unlike in many democracies, the position is not a political appointment tied to the ruling coalition, a structure Levin’s government has long sought to change.
Last year, Baharav-Miara ordered an investigation into Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Netanyahu, after a report alleged that she had harassed opponents.","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/middleeast/israel-shin-bet-october-7-fault-intl-latam/index.html,Israel’s Shin Bet says October 7 attack could have been prevented as it admits fault and casts blame,2025-03-04 21:50:29,"Israel’s Shin Bet security agency has said it “failed in its mission” to prevent Hamas’ October 7 attack by ignoring repeated warning signs.
Shin Bet’s chief, Ronen Bar, said in a statement that if Shin Bet had “acted differently in the years leading up to the attack and on the night of the attack (…) the massacre would have been prevented.”
“As the head of the organization, I will carry this heavy burden on my shoulders for the rest of my life,” he said.
In a summary of an internal investigation published Tuesday evening, Shin Bet, officially the Israel Security Agency, said that a wide range of factors were responsible for Hamas’ ability to stage the catastrophic attack.
Among them, Shin Bet said, were Qatar’s years-long payments to Hamas. Those payments were blessed by Israel, whose government believed it was beneficial to drive a political wedge between Gaza and the West Bank.
Qatar rejected Shin Bet’s accusations, saying in a statement Wednesday they are false and “are yet another example of deflection driven by self-interest and self-preservation in Israeli politics.”
“It is well known within Israel and internationally that all aid sent from Qatar to Gaza was transferred with the full knowledge, support, and supervision of the current and previous Israeli administrations and their security agencies – including the Shin Bet,” Qatar said, adding that “no aid has ever been delivered to Hamas’s political or military wing.”
Despite being made aware of Hamas’ plan for a broad offensive, known as “The Walls of Jericho,” in two different iterations in 2018 and 2022, the security agency failed to prevent the biggest terrorist attack in the country’s history.
The security agency received a sequence of signs that Hamas was preparing for an emergency, but decided the militant group were “not interested in escalation” and the plans were never perceived as an active threat, Shin Bet said.
The report summary says that the agency had huge gaps in “the recruitment and operation of human agents” in Gaza and that it was unclear where the Shin Bet and Israeli military responsibilities for detecting an attack from Gaza lay.
Hamas and its allies killed more than 1,200 people and took 251 hostage.
The investigation summary was published five days after an investigation by the Israeli military that highlighted gaps in intelligence gathering, flawed assumptions about Hamas, and “systemic” failures in the Israel Defense Force’s preparedness and response.
But Shin Bet says that it alone does not entirely carry the burden for the October 7 attack.
Shin Bet also blamed policies enacted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government as contributing factors, setting off a political firestorm.
Among the factors that contributed to Hamas’ decision to launch the attack, the report summary said, were Israeli politicians’ visits to the Al Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, “the treatment of prisoners, and the perception that Israeli society has been weakened due to the damage to social cohesion.”
The prime minister’s inner circle lashed out at the agency, with a source close to Netanyahu telling CNN the Shin Bet investigation “does not answer a single question.”
“The Shin Bet’s investigation conclusions do not match the magnitude of the organization’s and its leader’s enormous failure and negligence,” the source told CNN on Tuesday.
The source close to Netanyahu also accused the Shin Bet chief of failing to wake up the prime minister on the night of the attack, despite it being “the most basic and obvious decision imaginable.”
Netanyahu’s team has ramped up its criticism of the agency and Bar in recent weeks, especially after it was revealed that Shin Bet is investigating several people in Netanyahu’s office for inappropriately lobbying on behalf of Qatar’s government – something his office denies.
He removed Bar and the head of the Mossad, David Barnea, from the negotiating team engaging in indirect talks with Hamas.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid slammed Netanyahu for what he said was shirking responsibility for the devastating attack. “The prime minister continues to try to shift the blame onto others, this time it’s ‘they didn’t wake me up,’” Lapid said on X Tuesday.
“This country has been awake for 515 days, we still have hostages in Gaza. It’s time for you to wake up, apologize, take responsibility. This happened on your watch,” he added.
Israel’s former defense minister Benny Gantz also criticized Netanyahu for “throwing mud at the Shin Bet” instead of apologizing. “There is no leadership, no responsibility and there is no limit to cynicism,” Gantz said on X.","['Lauren Izso', 'Caitlin Danaher', 'Mick Krever']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/middleeast/us-arab-gaza-reconstruction-plan-rejects-hnk-intl/index.html,US rejects plan for Gaza reconstruction proposed by Arab leaders,2024-01-08 00:00:00,"The Trump administration has rejected a long-awaited plan for the reconstruction of Gaza endorsed by Arab leaders, saying the president stands by his own vision which includes expelling the territory’s Palestinian residents and transforming it into a “riviera” owned by the United States.
“The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,” National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Tuesday night.
“President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.”
The postwar plan for the Gaza Strip, which was proposed by Egypt and calls for Hamas to cede power to an interim administration until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) can assume control, would allow its roughly 2 million Palestinians to remain, in contrast to Trump’s proposal.
Speaking in Cairo, PA President Mahmoud Abbas pledged that general elections will be held in the West Bank, Gaza and occupied East Jerusalem for the first time in nearly two decades “if circumstances are suitable.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still refuses to say what he envisions for Gaza’s post-war future, except to say that he endorses Trump’s plan for “a different Gaza.” And he thinks neither the PA nor Hamas should govern Gaza.
The $53 billion proposal by Arab nations calls for rebuilding Gaza by 2030. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives.
Jordanian officials told CNN earlier that the plan will be presented to President Donald Trump in the coming weeks.
Although Arab states endorsed Egypt’s plan, the extent of its regional support remains uncertain. Notably, the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – wealthy Gulf nations whose financial backing would be vital for any postwar strategy – were absent from the summit. Meanwhile, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune boycotted the meeting, citing “imbalances and shortcomings” and criticizing it as being “monopolized by a limited and narrow group of Arab countries.”
CNN obtained a copy of the document, which lays out an ambitious plan to develop shopping malls, an international convention center and even an airport within five years. It also aims to attract tourists by building resorts and enhancing the enclave’s Mediterranean coast.
It also acknowledges the difficulties that could be faced in disarming militants in the Gaza Strip.
“It is something that can be dealt with, and even ended forever, only if its causes are removed through a clear horizon and a credible political process,” it says.
Disarming Hamas
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters on Tuesday that the group’s arms were non-negotiable.
“The weapon of the resistance is a red line, and it is not negotiable,” he said. “We will not accept (any deal) to trade it for reconstruction or the entry of aid.”
Hamas has sent mixed signals about its future in Gaza in recent weeks. Analysts have said that while the group has shown that it is willing to discuss demilitarization as an end goal of a peace process, it is keen not to allow it to become a prerequisite of the process.
Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said last month that the group will not disarm and may even grow after the war in Gaza.
Last week, Hamas official Husam Badran said that the group was willing to step aside from governing Gaza. “Our only condition is for this to be an internal Palestinian matter – we will not allow any regional or international party to get involved,” he told Al Arabiya. “As long as there is national consensus, Hamas will not be involved in the governance.”
The current ceasefire in Gaza, in place since January, remains in doubt after its first phase expired on Saturday. Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal to extend the cessation of hostilities and the release of hostages taken in Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war.
Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to pressure Hamas to accept the agreement and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting.
The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel’s obligations as an occupying power under international law.
Speaking at the summit announcing the plan for Gaza’s future, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said there would be no “true peace” without the establishment of the Palestinian state.
Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both Gaza and the West Bank, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state.

It was unclear if Israel or the United States would accept the Egyptian plan whose endorsement by Arab leaders, announced by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, amounted to a widespread rejection of Trump’s proposal. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment.
Tuesday’s summit in Cairo included the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia — countries whose support is crucial for any postwar plan. UN Secretary-General António Guterres also attended.
Addressing the summit, el-Sissi said that the plan “preserves the right of Palestinian people in rebuilding their nation and guarantees their existence on their land.”
Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the summit’s final communique calls on the UN Security Council to deploy an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
“Peace is the Arabs’ strategic option,” he told a news conference, adding that the communique rejected the transfer of Palestinians and endorsed Egypt’s reconstruction plan.
“The Egyptian plan creates a path for a new security and political context in Gaza,” he said.
Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting.
The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel’s obligations as an occupying power under international law.
The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.
Egypt’s postwar plan
Egypt’s $53 billion plan foresees rebuilding Gaza by 2030 without removing its population. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives.
The final communique said Egypt will host an international conference in cooperation with the United Nations for Gaza’s reconstruction, and a World Bank-overseen trust fund will be established to receive pledges to implement the early recovery and reconstruction plan.
According to a 112-page draft of the plan obtained by The Associated Press, hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up for Gaza’s population while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, with some of it used as infill to expand land on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast.
In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building “sustainable, green and walkable” housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.
It also calls for the opening of an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and a commercial port in Gaza, but the projects withered as the peace process collapsed.
Under the plan, Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit.
Israel has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas’ disarmament. Hamas, which doesn’t accept Israel’s existence, has said it’s willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but won’t give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state.
Speaking at the summit, el-Sissi said there is a need for a parallel path for peace to achieve a “comprehensive, just and lasting settlement” to the Palestinian cause.
“There will be no true peace without the establishment of the Palestinian state,” the Egyptian leader said. “It’s time to adopt the launching of a serious and effective political path that leads to a permanent and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause according to the resolutions of international legitimacy.”
Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel’s government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood.
Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern “Riviera.”
Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law.
Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said Egypt was “trying to present a credible alternative focused on reconstruction and an indirect consultation mechanism for Hamas that could reassure Israel and the US.”
Jordan offers to treat children from Gaza
Trump has suggested Egypt and Jordan, two close American allies, could take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Both countries have adamantly rejected any such plan.
Meeting with Trump at the White House last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan offered to take in around 2,000 for medical treatment. The first group of around 30 children, accompanied by up to two family members, left Gaza for Jordan on Tuesday, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
Jordan said the children are amputees and will return to Gaza when their treatment is complete. The kingdom has also set up field hospitals in Gaza and delivered aid by air and land.
The war began with Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas-led militants are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead.
Most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israel has rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more.
Israel’s 15-month offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It doesn’t say how many were fighters, but the ministry says women and children made up more than half the dead. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.
The offensive destroyed large areas of Gaza, including much of its health system and other infrastructure. At its height, the war displaced about 90% of the population, mostly within the territory, where hundreds of thousands packed into squalid tent camps and schools repurposed as shelters.",['the Associated Press'],en

The plan is being discussed by Arab leaders meeting in Cairo in an emergency summit on Tuesday, with Egypt’s president proposing a Palestinian committee to temporarily govern Gaza – taking over from Hamas and eventually handing power to the Palestinian Authority (PA).
“With the help of its Palestinian brothers, Egypt has worked to create a Palestinian administrative committee of independent professionals and technocrats, who will be tasked with governing Gaza with the expertise of its members,” President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said at the summit.
The committee will be responsible for overseeing the relief process and governing the strip’s issues for a “temporary period” in preparation for the return of the PA to Gaza, Sisi said.
The plan will be presented to US President Donald Trump in the coming weeks, Jordanian official sources told CNN earlier.
Egypt is proposing the formation of an independent, technocratic Palestinian committee to rule Gaza for an interim 6-month period “under the umbrella of” the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA), whose members would have no affiliations to Palestinian factions, the document said.
Branded “Gaza 2030” and bearing an Egyptian presidential logo, the 91-page document proposes that Egypt and Jordan train Palestinian police forces for deployment to secure the strip.
CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the document and has reached out to Egyptian authorities for comment.
The proposal was formulated as a response to Trump’s plan to take ownership of Gaza, expel its residents to neighboring countries and turn it into a Middle Eastern “riviera.”
The plan rejects displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and calls on the international community to address the “humanitarian catastrophe” created by the war in enclave.
The postwar plan, the document said, requires arrangements for transitional governance “in a way that preserves the two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and “prevents the outbreak of new conflicts.”
Speaking at the summit in Cairo, Egypt’s president said he has faith that Trump is capable of adopting “serious and effective” solutions to the war in Gaza.
“The time has come to adopt a serious and effective political pathway that leads to a fair and lasting solution for the Palestinian cause, in accordance to the resolutions of international legitimacy,” Sisi said. “I have faith that President Trump is capable of doing this.”
Shopping malls and tourist resorts
The document lays out an ambitious plan to develop shopping malls, an international convention center and even an airport within five years. It also aims to attract tourists by building resorts and enhancing the enclave’s Mediterranean coast.
Egypt estimates Gaza’s reconstruction costs at $53 billion. Of that, $3 billion would be allocated for rubble removal, clearing unexploded munitions, and constructing temporary housing. An additional $20 billion would fund the first two years of reconstruction, focusing on utilities and permanent housing. The remaining $30 billion would go toward developing a seaport, airport, and industrial zones.
The proposal also calls on the United Nations Security Council to consider deploying international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank to protect both Palestinians and Israelis.
It acknowledges the difficulties that could be faced in disarming militants in the strip.
“It is something that can be dealt with, and even ended forever, only if its causes are removed through a clear horizon and a credible political process,” it says.
On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that the group’s arms were non-negotiable.
“The weapon of the resistance is a red line, and it is not negotiable,” he said. “We will not accept (any deal) to trade it for reconstruction or the entry of aid.”
Hamas has sent mixed signals about its future in Gaza in recent weeks. Analysts have said that while the group has shown that it is willing to discuss demilitarization as an end goal of a peace process, it is keen not to allow it to become a prerequisite of the process.
Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said last month that the group will not disarm and may even grow after the war in Gaza.
On Wednesday last week, Hamas official Husam Badran said that the group was willing to step aside from governing Gaza. “Our only condition is for this to be an internal Palestinian matter – we will not allow any regional or international party to get involved,” he told Al Arabiya. “As long as there is national consensus, Hamas will not be involved in the governance.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still refuses to say what he envisions for Gaza’s post-war future, except to say that he endorses Trump’s plan for “a different Gaza.” And he thinks neither the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority nor Hamas should govern Gaza.
It is unclear whether Trump intends to carry through on his expulsion plan. After receiving forceful pushback from Egyptian and Jordanian leaders, Trump told Fox News last month: “The way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it.”
The plan also comes as a delicate truce between Israel and Hamas hangs by a thread after Israel blocked humanitarian aid into Gaza, in response to Hamas rejecting a new Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire without any commitment to end the war or fully withdraw troops.
Hamas has accused Israel of violating the agreement, calling its decision to halt humanitarian aid “cheap blackmail” and a “war crime.”
The summit comes as talks to extend the Gaza ceasefire have entered “a crucial 48 to 72 hours,” an Israeli official told CNN on Tuesday. If Hamas does not accede to Israel’s conditions, “then yes it’s on the table that they can go back to war,” the official said of the military.","['Becky Anderson', 'Mostafa Salem', 'Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Abbas Al Lawati']",en

Hamas has accused Israel of violating the agreement, calling its decision to halt humanitarian aid “cheap blackmail” and a “war crime.”
Fifty-nine hostages remain in Gaza after the return of four bodies last week. Of the 59, 24 are thought to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.
Meanwhile, aid groups and the United Nations have slammed the Israeli announcement to halt aid, with Egypt, a mediator in the ceasefire deal, saying it “unequivocally rejects the politicization of humanitarian aid and its exploitation as a tool of blackmail.”
US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff plans to return to the Middle East “in the coming days to work out either a way to extend Phase I or advance to Phase II” of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, a US State Department spokesperson said on Monday.
Here’s what we know about the agreement and the hurdles it is facing.
What the deal says
The ceasefire deal is meant to take place in three phases.
On January 19, the first phase of the agreement came into effect. It lasted 42 days and expired last weekend.
The first phase was intended to free 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and an influx of aid into Gaza.
Ultimately, Hamas released 38 hostages over 39 days.
Israel released 1,737 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including 120 women and children. Some had been convicted of serious crimes including murder. The majority had been detained and held without any charge.
Israeli forces also withdrew to Gaza’s border regions, leaving all urban centers and a key corridor splitting the enclave in half.
A second, 42-day ceasefire phase was meant to see a commitment to permanently ending the war, the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, and the release of all living hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
The exact details of phase two were meant to have been decided during the first phase. The second phase was supposed to have begun Sunday.
The ceasefire agreement stipulates that the truce can continue so long as negotiators are talking. The two sides were meant to begin talks on a permanent end to the war in early February. However, weeks have passed and it’s unclear if they have started.
On Friday, an Israeli delegation abruptly returned from Cairo, one day after arriving there. A Hamas spokesperson over the weekend said there were currently “no negotiations” underway on the second phase, blaming Israel for the failure to start talks.
What Israel is saying
Israel now wants to extend the first phase of the deal for another 42 days to continue the exchange of hostages, alive and deceased, in return for the continued release of Palestinian prisoners and the flow of higher volumes of aid into Gaza – but without any commitment to permanently ending the war.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the proposed extension, which would run through the Islamic month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover, was an idea put forward by Witkoff. Passover ends in mid-April.
There has been no word from Witkoff or the Trump administration on the revised plan, nor on Israel’s assertion that suspending aid for Gaza was agreed with Washington.
Israel said Hamas rejected the proposal, and in return, halted all humanitarian aid into the strip.
“In light of Hamas’ refusal to accept the (US envoy Steve) Witkoff framework for continuing the talks — which Israel had agreed to — Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be stopped,” Netanyahu’s office said Sunday.
The Israeli Prime Minister’s office (PMO) warned of “additional consequences” if Hamas continues to refuse to accept the proposal. Israel would not allow a ceasefire without the release of the remaining hostages, the statement added.
What Hamas is saying
Hamas is seeking negotiations on a permanent ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza under the second stage of the truce, accusing Israel of “ongoing manipulation” with its proposed extension of phase one.
The group lambasted Israel’s announcement and appealed to mediators to pressure Israel into ending its “punitive and immoral measures.”
Hamas also said the proposed extension “is a blatant attempt to evade the agreement and evade entering into negotiations for its second phase,” adding that the only way to return the hostages “is to adhere to the agreement, immediately enter into negotiations to start the second stage, and the occupation’s commitment to implement its pledges.”
“We reaffirm our commitment to implementing the signed agreement in its three stages, and we have repeatedly announced our readiness to begin negotiations for the second stage of the agreement,” the group added on Sunday.
What others are saying
Israel has framed the extension proposal as a US-led effort. It is unclear which country initiated the proposal, but White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes has expressed support for Israel.
“Israel has negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists. We will support their decision on next steps given Hamas has indicated it’s no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire,” Hughes said.
Israel’s blocking of aid was however slammed by many of the international community, including mediators of the deal, the UN and aid groups.
Egypt said it “unequivocally rejects the politicization of humanitarian aid and its exploitation as a tool of blackmail.” It called on the international community to “take decisive action to compel the Israeli government to allow the unconditional entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.”
Qatar said it categorically rejects “the use of food as war weapon and starvation of civilians.”
UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, said on X that “Israel’s decision to halt aid into Gaza is alarming.”
“International humanitarian law is clear: We must be allowed access to deliver vital lifesaving aid,” he said, adding that “the ceasefire must hold.”
What happens next?
The fate of dozens of Israeli hostages and tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza now remains unclear amid fears that the ceasefire may collapse.
Netanyahu remains under pressure by far-right ministers of his government to return to war, a prospect that may be met with less opposition under the new Trump administration.
In a press release, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum appealed to Trump that a deal be finalized, bringing all hostages home.
Representatives of the hostages families “implored that negotiations continue without delay and pressed for finalizing a comprehensive deal to secure the immediate release of all hostages in a single phase, emphasizing that time is running out for those still in captivity,” the press release said. “President Trump, bring us a better deal, a safer deal. No stages, no phases. One deal to bring everyone home.”
In a development likely seen as provocative by Hamas, an Israel source told CNN last week that Israel will not withdraw its forces from the Gaza-Egypt border – the so-called Philadelphi Corridor – as would be required under a potential second phase of a ceasefire with Hamas.
Meanwhile, Gaza’s population of more than 2 million is at risk of losing the little aid it received during the ceasefire deal.
While the overall aid entering Gaza has increased since the ceasefire started, “restrictions by Israeli authorities on critical supplies are hindering the humanitarian response,” Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors without Borders, said. “Most of the aid that entered was food and fuel, not nearly enough to meet the people’s immense needs.”
Reuters footage on Sunday showed lines of trucks at Gaza’s Rafah crossing with Egypt awaiting entry after Israel’s declaration that humanitarian aid is now allowed in.
The shaky ceasefire was coupled with Israeli strikes on the north and south of the strip over the weekend, which Palestinian health authorities said killed four people.
Through the ceasefire, Israel has continued to fire on Palestinians it says are violating the truce or threatening its troops.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/middleeast/israel-egypt-war-gaza-intl/index.html,"With Gaza tensions high, Egyptians and Israelis warn of a new war",2025-01-19 00:00:00,"“Are we going to war?” asks a worried Cairo saleswoman upon learning that she’s speaking to a journalist. The ominous question about the prospect of war between Egypt and Israel has crept into many conversations in the country.
These murmurs of war reveal growing concerns among a population worn down by successive economic crises and horrified by the devastation it has seen Israel inflict on Gaza and Lebanon. Over the past few weeks, the diplomatic row over US President Donald Trump’s proposal to forcibly displace Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt has intensified this anxiety, turning this chatter into fervent debate.
The same question, along with alarming answers, has ricocheted through Egyptian, Arab and Israeli media. An Israeli website published an AI-generated scenario of an attack destroying Egypt’s strategic High Dam. And an Egyptian YouTuber posted an AI-generated video of an attack on Israel’s nuclear reactor. Keyboard warriors trade accusations and threats on various social media platforms and TV shows debate what they see as evidence of each side’s readiness for war.
According to a report in Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, this “war sentiment” is fueled by misleading information amplified by right-wing outlets in Israel. It debunked many of the claims circulating on social media and TV about an Egyptian military buildup at the border.
Amos Harel, a defense analyst at Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said he doesn’t know “how much (of) this is coordinated and how much is spontaneous,” but added that it may be in the interest of the Israeli far right to “stir the pot regarding Egypt” to divert attention from domestic criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Families of hostages held in Gaza have accused Netanyahu of wavering on a deal to free the captives in order to appease hardliners in his government, which he has denied. Egypt and other mediators are trying to salvage the ceasefire, which went into effect in January and is now hanging by a thread.
Tensions over the Sinai Peninsula
The main point of contention is whether Cairo has deployed more soldiers and military equipment to the Sinai than permitted under the security provisions that followed the 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
The treaty, brokered by the United States, ended decades of war between both countries and set limits on Egypt’s military footprint in the Sinai Peninsula that borders Israel. It ushered in an era of close security cooperation between the two, and with the US.
Egypt has been keen to emphasize that it is following the rules. In 2016, while fighting a local ISIS branch, it secured Israel’s approval to expand its military presence in the Sinai. When Egypt reinforced its border with Gaza and bolstered its security last year, Egyptian officials insisted the deployment remained within the framework of a 2016 agreement between the two.
In September, Egypt conducted a military drill in Sinai using live ammunition, followed by a military parade in October that was attended by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi. Media on both sides of the border have aired footage of these events and said they are signs of possible war preparations.
Such alarm hasn’t been confined to the media, as Israeli officials have also chimed in.
“We have (seen) bases being built that can only be used for offensive operations,” Israel’s ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told a meeting of American Jewish leaders in January. He alleged Egypt was in “serious violation” of the peace treaty and that this would be addressed “very emphatically.”
Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, reportedly asked why Egypt is spending “hundreds of millions of dollars on military equipment” in an interview with an Israeli radio station. “This should raise alarm bells. We have learned our lesson. We must monitor Egypt closely and prepare for every scenario,” he said.
Egyptian and Israeli military spokespeople did not respond to CNN questions regarding the alleged deployments and whether they would constitute a violation of the security agreements.
Military analysts on both sides dismiss media reports of Egyptian deployments in Sinai as baseless.
“No (Egyptian) tank enters Sinai without Israel’s approval,” said Hossam el-Hamalawy, a Berlin-based Egyptian security analyst, arguing that Egypt’s military doesn’t have the capacity to enter a war with Israel. Most of the videos of Egyptian military deployment and drills circulating in Arab and Israeli media, he explained, are either old or not filmed in Sinai.
‘If we are destined to fight, we are up to it’
In a rare TV interview with the traditionally media-shy military establishment, a leading Egyptian military commander, Maj. Gen. Ahmad Mahmoud Safi El-Din, told Saudi news channel Al-Hadath on Thursday that Egypt’s military expenditure and efforts to modernize its arsenal were meant to “preserve peace and stability in the region.”
Outgoing Israeli military chief of staff Herzi Halevi also addressed the growing concern in a public address last week but said it was not a priority. “We think that it is not a threat at the moment, but it could change in an instant,” he said.
With the absence of a stated government position, the matter was left for influential media personalities to interpret.
“We are not on the verge of a war with Israel,” popular Egyptian talk show host Amr Adib told viewers in February. Known for his close ties to the Egyptian government, he was careful to couch his reassurance, saying it only reflects the current moment, “as in right now, at 10:15 p.m.,” he said, looking at his watch, implying it could quickly change.
Both countries violate the peace treaty, he said, and it would only collapse if one side attacks the other, “but we are not entering war.”
“Israel understands it would be seriously hurt in such confrontation… If we are destined to fight, we are up to it,” he added.
Unprecedented pressure on peace treaty
The creeping threat of war has overshadowed domestic issues facing the leaders of both countries. Yet, analysts also point to a series of events that could potentially undermine the treaty.
“Rational minds do not want the treaty to be at risk. The action taken over the past 15 months have put pressure on the treaty that have never been at this level before,” said Nabil Fahmy, former Egyptian foreign minister and dean emeritus of the School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the American University in Cairo.
What could eventually tip the balance is the potential expulsion of Gazans into Egypt, which Fahmy said would constitute a threat to Egypt’s national security.
In the months leading up to Israel’s operation in the Gazan border city of Rafah, which started in May, Egypt warned that forcing over 1 million Palestinians sheltering there into Egypt, as proposed by some Israeli officials, would put the treaty at risk.
A year ago, Sisi, the Egyptian president, told reporters and his European counterparts that any such displacement would mean moving the Palestinian fight against Israel to Egyptian territory. “Sinai would become a base for fighting against Israel… In response, Israel would attack Egyptian territory,” he said.
So, when Trump presented his plan to displace Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan and turn Gaza into a Middle Eastern “riviera,” this scenario was already in the back of people’s minds.
“Israelis did not take the Trump plan seriously. But on the Egyptian side, it was taken deadly seriously,” explained Max Rodenbeck, the Israel/Palestine project director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. Fearing that pressure would build up in Washington D.C. for Cairo to comply, Egyptians had to make a show of political force and indicate that the treaty is at risk, he said.
Arab nations didn’t want to directly antagonize the US president by engaging in a media spat. In their rejection of the plan, official statements said they looked forward to cooperation with Trump to achieve peace in the region. Arab leaders are expected to meet in Cairo this week to discuss a counter plan to present to Trump.
Whether Trump backtracks or not, there is a realization among Arab nations that the region, like the rest of the world, is entering uncharted territory under his second term in office.
“Trump’s proposal is in complete contradiction with the whole objective of comprehensive peace between Arabs and Israelis,” Fahmy said.
Fahmy, like the security experts who spoke with CNN, downplayed the real-life impact of the media chatter about an impending war, but all were worried by its growing intensity.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the proposed temporary extension of phase one of the Gaza ceasefire would run through the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover, which ends in mid-April. He said the extension was an idea put forward by President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.
The 42-day initial phase of the ceasefire, agreed upon in Qatar in January, ended on Saturday. Israel missed the early February deadline to start phase two talks, and there is no indication they ever began.
There has been no word from Witkoff or the Trump administration on the revised plan, nor on Israel’s assertion that suspending aid for Gaza was agreed with Washington.
Israel and Hamas have been split on what comes next after the end of the first phase of the ceasefire, under which dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees were freed since January.
The proposal to extend the initial phase of the truce reportedly envisions half of the hostages held in Gaza being released on the day the extension begins.
Aid groups and the United Nations slammed the Israeli announcement, while Egypt, a mediator in the hostage-ceasefire deal, said it “unequivocally rejects the politicization of humanitarian aid and its exploitation as a tool of blackmail.”
Hamas, which is seeking negotiations on a permanent end to the fighting and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, immediately rejected the plan, saying that Netanyahu and his government were carrying out “a blatant coup against the ceasefire deal” that had already been agreed.
“The only path to regional stability and the return of the prisoners is the full implementation of the agreement, starting with the second phase, which includes negotiations for a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal, reconstruction, and then the release of prisoners as part of an agreed-upon deal,” Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi said.
Hamas also said Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid into Gaza amounts to “cheap blackmail” and a “war crime,” and appealed to mediators to pressure Israel into ending its “punitive and immoral measures.”
Israel moved swiftly after Hamas rejected the proposal, escalating a stand-off over a truce that brought an end to months of fighting in Gaza.
Netanyahu’s office said Sunday that “in light of Hamas’ refusal to accept the (US envoy Steve) Witkoff framework for continuing the talks — which Israel had agreed to — Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be stopped.”
The Israeli Prime Minister’s office (PMO) warned of “additional consequences” if Hamas continues to refuse to accept the proposal. Israel would not allow a ceasefire without the release of the remaining hostages, the statement added.
Phase two doubts
Phase two of the Gaza ceasefire agreement was supposed to last another 42 days, see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the release of all living hostages held by Hamas – estimated to number 24 men – in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
Talks to determine its implementation were thrown into doubt Friday when an Israeli delegation abruptly returned from Cairo, a day after arriving in the Egyptian capital, weeks after Netanyahu blew past a February 3 deadline to send a negotiating team.
Israeli officials have indicated their desire for phase one to continue rather than moving on to the more difficult negotiations in phase two. An Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN earlier in the week that Israel was trying to prolong the first phase of the agreement “by as much as possible” in the hope of releasing more hostages.
Netanyahu is under tremendous pressure to return to war. His finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to withdraw from the governing coalition if Israel doesn’t restart the war and Itamar Ben Gvir quit his post as national security minister over the ceasefire.
Hamas has repeatedly committed itself to the ceasefire. Despite walking close to the edge when it sent to Israel the body of an unknown Palestinian woman instead of hostage Shiri Bibas – mistakenly, the group says – it has largely stuck to the agreement.
Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar said Israel was prepared to continue negotiations “including for the second phase” in exchange for the release of hostages.
“As the first phase of the framework has ended - we have halted the entry of trucks into Gaza. We wouldn’t do it for free,” Saar said at a news conference on Sunday.
Aid vital for Gaza
Nearly 17 months of war in Gaza have reduced much of the enclave to rubble, killed more than 48,000 people, and led to dire living conditions for almost all of its residents.
The enclave almost exclusively relies on humanitarian aid, with aid agencies warning last month that the humanitarian needs of those in Gaza remain huge, despite the promise of a huge influx of aid under phase one of the deal.
Aid agencies on Sunday denounced the Israeli decision to halt aid to Gaza. The International Red Cross said that “any unravelling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair.”
Another agency that works extensively in Gaza, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said that “regardless of negotiations between warring parties, people in Gaza still need an immediate and massive scale-up of humanitarian supplies.”
MSF emergency coordinator Caroline Seguin said there had already been a price spike in Gaza on the news that aid flows were being halted. Ismail Zayda, a civilian shopping at a market in southern Gaza on Sunday, told CNN that prices for basics were already rising, with cheese, tahini and tomatoes about 50% more expensive than previously. He said diesel fuel had disappeared altogether.
Adding to the sense that the truce is in jeopardy, four people were killed by Israeli military operations in Gaza on Sunday, the health ministry said.
The Israeli military has continued to operate inside Gaza since the ceasefire began on January 19, but there has been a marked decline in casualties.
The original ceasefire agreement stipulates that the truce can continue so long as negotiators are talking.
In an apparent attempt to add to the pressure on Israel, Hamas on Saturday released a propaganda video on Saturday showing Israeli hostages in Gaza, including a scene of recently freed captive Iair Horn bidding farewell to his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity after 512 days.
Iair and Eitan’s family authorized media use of the video, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters, saying in a statement: “We demand from the decision-makers: Look Eitan in the eyes. Don’t stop the agreement that has already brought dozens of hostages back to us. They are running out of time! Bring everyone home, now, in one phase,” it said.
Israel’s PMO condemned the video as cruel “psychological warfare.”
The ceasefire came into effect in January. Altogether 33 Israeli hostages were released – including two men held in Gaza for a decade – as well as five Thai citizens who had been working on a kibbutz in southern Israel when they were taken hostage. Eight bodies were returned. They included the remains of Bibas and her two small sons - a hugely emotional moment for Israelis.
A total of 1,737 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released, including 120 women and children. About 1,000 of those released had been arrested after the October 7 attacks; others were serving long sentences, including life. Some had been in Israeli prisons for decades.",[],en

“No Other Land” tells the story of the continued demolition by Israeli authorities of Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in the Hebron mountains of the West Bank where Basel Adra, one of the directors, lives with his family.
The documentary follows the Israeli government’s attempt to evict the villagers by force, having claimed the land for a military training facility and firing range in 1981. Viewers see the local playground being torn down, the killing of Adra’s brother by Israeli soldiers, and other attacks by Jewish settlers while the community tries to survive.
The film also shows the human connection between Adra and the film’s other creator, Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.
While filming for “No Other Land” wrapped before Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, prompting Israel to launch its war in Gaza, the documentary’s themes are especially relevant during a time of heightened conflict in the Middle East.
Palestinians in the West Bank have faced evictions and the encroachment of Jewish settlers for decades.
Hours before the film’s Oscar win, residents of the West Bank area depicted in the documentary were attacked by Israeli settlers who were accompanied by Israeli forces, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
Israeli soldiers detained three people in the area and settlers attacked residents of the village of Khirbet Asfi, in Masafer Yatta, throwing stones, destroying solar panels and damaging water tanks, Wafa reported, citing the head of the Susiya village council Jihad Nawajaa.
Images obtained by CNN showed several solar panels and a home security camera which appeared to have been damaged by stones.
CNN has contacted Israel’s military for comment.
‘Harsh reality’
Israel has ramped up its military campaign in the West Bank, displacing roughly 40,000 Palestinians since late January, according to the United Nations, with Israel’s defense minister promising to occupy large areas for the remainder of the year.
The Israeli military says it is targeting Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank who have mounted attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. But Palestinians and human rights groups say the expanded assault is increasingly indiscriminate – killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in a manner that is consistent with collective punishment.
The filmmakers used their acceptance speeches to highlight the effects of Israel’s military campaigns in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
Adra said the film “reflects the harsh reality that we have been suffering for decades, a reality that continues until today, and we call on the world to take concrete steps to end this injustice.”
Abraham called for the end of the “terrible destruction of Gaza” and the release of Israeli hostages.
“We created this film together, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger,” he added.
The film has racked up several awards in the past year. But despite its critical acclaim, its creators have come under fire for their comments on the war in Gaza.
High-level German and Israeli officials criticized Abraham after he called for a ceasefire upon accepting the award for best documentary at the Berlin International Film Festival last February. Abraham said he subsequently received death threats.
Israel’s Minister of Culture and Sports called the film’s Oscar win “a sad moment for the world of cinema” in a post to social media Monday.
“Instead of presenting the complexity of Israeli reality, the filmmakers chose to amplify narratives that distort Israel’s image vis-à-vis international audiences,” Miki Zohar wrote.
“Freedom of expression is an important value, but turning the defamation of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not art—it is sabotage against the State of Israel, especially in the wake of the October 7th massacre and the ongoing war.”
Adra, a new father, said in his Oscar acceptance speech Sunday that he hopes his daughter “won’t have to live the life I’m living now: always anxious, fearing home demolitions, settler violence, and the threat of forced displacement that we, in Masafer Yatta, face every day living under Israeli occupation.”
“When I look at Basel, I see my brother, but we are not equal,” Abraham said. “We live under a regime where I enjoy freedom under civil law, and where he is governed by military laws.”",['Lex Harvey'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/world/no-other-land-documentary-palestine-cec/index.html,‘No Other Land’: Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers tell their own story,2024-11-03 07:00:49,"Editor’s Note: This interview was originally published November 2024 and has been updated following the 2025 Academy Awards.
Midway through the documentary “No Other Land,” journalist and activist Basel Adra recounts a 2009 visit to his village by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.
In a navy suit and crisp tie, surrounded by security detail and photographers, Blair walked through the village for seven minutes, Adra says in a voice-over.
He visits the local school, Adra says. He passes by Adra’s family’s home. He nods along to something someone says off camera, the footage shows. He shakes a hand. He smiles.
Months later, after Blair returns to the UK, Israel cancels the demolition orders held for the school and home in the street he visited, Adra says. In the mere handful of minutes, Blair accomplished what villagers had been trying to do for years.
“This,” Adra says, “is a story about power.”
“No Other Land” tells of the continued demolition of Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in the Hebron mountains of the West Bank where Adra and his family still live. But as we see the demolition — the local playground torn down, his family moving their beds and other belongings into a cave, his brother shot and killed by soldiers, attacks by Jewish settlers — Adra and the rest of the filmmakers also show us a community trying to survive.
Adra’s filming begins in 2019 and stretches until 2023, chronicling the Israeli government’s attempt to evict the villagers by force, having claimed the land for a military training facility and firing range in 1981. (During the lengthy legal battle, before the Israeli supreme court ruled in favor of demolishing homes in the villages in 2022, Israeli prosecutors argued that Palestinian residents only began squatting in the area when it was declared a firing range, after previously using the land as seasonal pasture. Residents countered, saying the IDF had blown up Palestinian homes in Masafer Yatta decades earlier, in 1966).
The acclaimed documentary most recently won an Academy Award for best documentary feature film. Still, Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, two of the filmmakers behind the documentary, told CNN that American distributors have been hesitant to pick up “No Other Land,” despite widespread acclaim from critics.
While the documentary finishes before the events of 2023’s Hamas attack, which took the lives of roughly 1,200 people in Israel, its release comes at a time when war in the Middle East is accelerating, as Israel’s offensive in Gaza have left at least 42,500 people dead since October 8, 2023. While promoting the film at the New York Film Festival in October, Abraham and Adra unexpectedly cut their US tour short to be with their families as the violence escalated. Even as the movie succeeds, they told CNN, little on the ground back home has improved.
Speaking from Adra’s family home in Masafer Yatta, they spoke with CNN about life under occupation, and what, if anything, their documentary might change.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
What motivated you to pick up the camera in the first place? Was making a documentary always the goal?
Basel Adra: No, it wasn’t. It was documenting. To document the things around me was the goal, and it always felt important to catch the incidents that’s happening around us as evidence of the reality of what’s happening. And then, after years, the guys joined, and we decided together that we want to make a movie.
Yuval Abraham: I came here as a journalist, so documenting was part of the job. It’s something that I believe in. I came into journalism out of realizing that there is so much that is not being told in the land that we live in that needs to be told. But for me, the act of documenting, whether it’s by writing or by filming, always has a purpose or an audience in mind, most of the time. Whereas for Basel, it’s also that, but as he said, it’s also the way to survive when you’re being attacked, or when your community is.
You started filming this in 2019 and you wrapped it up before the events of October 2023. Do you think the film has changed or taken on new meaning because of what’s happened since then?
Abraham: Of course, the movie meets the audience at the moment where the audience is. Now, Palestine and Israel are on the news 24/7 for the past year. To me, the film is showing the reality on the ground before October, and it’s showing essentially the decades-long occupation of Palestinians. And I think one of the reasons why we made the movie is, for me, is because — October 7 is an atrocity — but the world was not paying attention, almost at all, to the violent life that Palestinians are living under for decades before October.
This adds so much urgency for me to the film right now. It’s clear that, to anybody who watches our film and looks at the reality of the farmers in Masafer Yatta, living under Israeli military control is not something sustainable and it’s not something just. It’s not something that can continue. Me and Basel were born in the ‘90s. If we would have reached a political solution then, imagine how many more people would be alive today? And it’s unfortunate that people are now talking about the need for political change only after, in a way, human beings are paying with their blood.
I know with the recent escalation, you had to cut your time in the US short. How did it feel to go from touring this documentary all over the world, getting awards, etc., to zooming back home to Palestine and Israel?
Adra: It’s different. It’s not easy to go to the festivals and succeed, and journalists talk about it, the audience wants to see it, and it’s been sold out in many festivals. But coming back to the reality here, it’s sad to see that the situation is going, changing to be worse than it was even before.
Abraham: It’s a question that we always ask ourselves: What can we do to cause change? To end the occupation, to reach a political movement? Now, I think after really a year, it’s hard not to talk about Gaza, honestly, because you see every single day, literally, houses filled with families being bombed and little children obliterated or burnt alive. And now in the north of the Gaza Strip, there is an ethnic cleansing. It’s one of the biggest atrocities of our age and time, and the atrocities of October 7 cannot justify what has been going on every single day since.
What kind of footage do people need to see for the United States to change its foreign policy in a way which would be constructive for the people who are living here, in a way which will push us towards some kind of political solution?
Those of us who want to see a future where this oppression ends have to call for a change. And so can our film do that? I don’t think it can do that. It’s very hard to speak about the power now of documentary and footage, when there is so much footage. You can now Google. I mean, just open Twitter and open Facebook, you see so much endless footage of violence and nothing is changing. It’s a complicated position that we are in, so I don’t know what can change.
So, you don’t necessarily feel hope that things can change, because there’s footage everywhere?
Abraham: This is why we made a documentary, because there is a difference between just posting a random instance of violence to watching our film, which tells a very strong human story of a community for four years, trying to survive on their land. We hope that watching a film will have some kind of impact that these videos that we post on social media does not have.
At the end of the day, we’re not powerful people, and if the people who have power are not using their power to change the reality, then things are not going to change. We can make a million documentaries about it, but they’re not going to change their reality.
When was the moment where you decided, ‘I’m done waiting on other journalists; I’m going to tell my own story?’
Adra: Well, this is like back in the beginning, of documenting what’s going on. What I saw, like the missions happening, the attacks are happening here in Masafer Yatta. But it’s not a story, even, it’s a routine in our lives. So there I started using social media, writing articles and filming what is happening.
Abraham: There are times in history when policy becomes invisible to the people because it happens so much. It’s just routine. It’s part of the routine oppression. I think of South Africa, for example. There were times when it was just considered normal, under the apartheid regime, to have certain people who cannot vote for the main government. It was just normal. You didn’t need to report about it. And this is what’s really happening here in Masafer Yatta. Yesterday, houses were demolished. Was it reported anywhere? It’s not going to be reported, because this is the day-to-day life, the routine life, under the military occupation.
One of the challenges we face as journalists or even as activists, is how to take a policy that is a routine, that the people are not able to see, and to make them see it. And this is one reason to make the film, to make this policy a story that will be so strong that will show the human aspects of it in such a powerful way that people will be interested to see it.
I’ve heard some places have been hesitant to maybe distribute the documentary theatrically. Is that something that you have run into?
Adra: Yeah, we still don’t have a distributor in the US, we think it’s because of the subject, they’re not taking it. We wish this will change in the future, because we really want the movie to be shown around the US, and we want millions of people to see it.
What are you hoping the impact will be?
Adra: We want political change for the situation here.
Abraham: Change is possible, especially if there is willingness from the US leaders to allow us to reach the point of change. The United States is very much complicit in what we are seeing in our movie. For a better future for Palestinians and for Israelis, we need change in US foreign policy, and we hope that the film will contribute to that.
Like that moment with Blair, for example.
Abraham: It just gives you an example of people’s lives here are getting ruined, and for people in power who are sitting in Washington, DC or in New York or in London, to change that is a matter of lifting their finger to exert pressure on Israel to stop.
Of course, in the long term, we hope that the film — and not only our film, activism and work that we are doing on the ground and abroad — will lead to an end to this occupation, and to a political solution that is based on Palestinians having freedom, and Palestinians and Israelis both having political and individual rights. And the way to do that is the US changing their foreign policy. That is one of the main things that need to change, and if our film can contribute to that, even just a little bit, then I’m very, very happy that we made it.",['Leah Asmelash'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/01/europe/gaza-ceasefire-ends-israel-hamas-intl/index.html,Gaza ceasefire hits expiration date with Israel and Hamas split on way forward,2025-03-01 15:13:16,"The first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, under which dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees were freed, reached its expiration date on Saturday — with Israel and Hamas split on what comes next.
In essence, the Israelis want phase one to continue – the exchange of hostages, alive and deceased, in return for the continued release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and the flow of higher volumes of aid into Gaza. There are thought to be 24 Israeli hostages still alive in Gaza.
But Hamas insists that negotiations include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of Gaza they still occupy and a permanent end to the conflict, as envisaged in the second phase of the deal.
Following a consultation with ministers on Saturday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in the early hours of Sunday that Israel backs a US proposal to temporarily extend the current ceasefire during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover.
According to that framework, the ceasefire extension would start with a significant release of half of the remaining Israeli living and deceased hostages in Gaza. The statement said: “On the first day of the framework, half of the living and deceased hostages will be released and upon its conclusion – if agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire – the remaining living and deceased hostages will be released.”
Hamas would not comment on the Israeli prime minister’s office statement on Sunday.
But because the US-proposed extension would not mean entering the second phase of the deal, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem appeared to rule out that approach on Saturday, telling CNN that Israel “aims to recover its captives while maintaining the possibility of resuming aggression against the Gaza Strip, which contradicts the terms of the agreement.”
“Extending the first phase in the manner proposed by the occupation is unacceptable to us,” he said.
The original ceasefire agreement stipulates that the truce can continue so long as negotiators are talking, but it’s not clear they are.
An Israeli delegation abruptly returned from Cairo on Friday, one day after arriving there. An Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN earlier in the week that Israel was trying to prolong the first phase of the agreement “by as much as possible” in the hope of releasing more hostages.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres issued an urgent appeal on Saturday for all parties to avoid a return to violence, saying, “It is imperative that all efforts be made to prevent a return to hostilities, which would be catastrophic.”
In an apparent attempt to add to the pressure, Hamas on Saturday released a propaganda video on Saturday showing Israeli hostages in Gaza, including a scene of recently freed captive Iair Horn bidding farewell to his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity after 512 days.
Iair and Eitan’s family authorized media’s use of the video, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters, saying in a statement: “We demand from the decision-makers: Look Eitan in the eyes. Don’t stop the agreement that has already brought dozens of hostages back to us. They are running out of time! Bring everyone home, now, in one phase,” it said.
The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office condemned the video as cruel “psychological warfare.”
What the ceasefire achieved so far
The ceasefire came into effect in January. Altogether 33 Israeli hostages were released – including two men held in Gaza for a decade – as well as five Thai citizens who had been working on kibbutz in southern Israel when they were taken hostage. Eight bodies were returned. They included the remains of Shiri Bibas and her two small sons - a hugely emotional moment for Israelis.
A total of 1,737 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released, including 120 women and children. About 1,000 of those released had been arrested after the Hamas attacks on Israel in October 2023; others were serving long sentences, including life. Some had been in Israeli prisons for decades.
Israeli forces also withdrew from a key corridor splitting north and south Gaza.
The first phase was not smooth, with accusations by each side that the other was contravening the agreement. Israel was aggrieved by the choreographed hostage handover ceremonies organized by Hamas, and especially by the return of a body said to be that of Shiri Bibas which turned out to be that of a Gazan woman.
In return, Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of people in Gaza to the north, part of the first phase of the agreement, and of obstructing the entry of essential medicines and hospital supplies, as well as tents, prefabricated houses, fuel and rubble-removing machines into Gaza
There were several delays and changes to the schedule, and a good deal of brinkmanship, but international mediators were able to keep the deal alive.
Against this background, talks were due to start at the beginning of February on the second phase of the deal. These were repeatedly delayed, amid accusations from Hamas that Israel was showing no interest in phase two.
Right-wing members of the Israeli cabinet have demanded a return to war once the first phase was complete. Their support is critical in sustaining Netanyahu’s administration, which must pass a budget by the end of the month.
Hamas has shown during the first phase of the deal that it is still standing, even if battered. The goals of turning the ceasefire into a permanent end to hostilities and the destruction of Hamas are irreconcilable, short of the group agreeing to be disarmed. It has shown no sign of that.
Waiting in the wings is the evolving Arab plan to offer an alternative to US President Donald Trump’s blueprint for removing Gaza’s 2 million people. Regional sources say it envisages a 10-year mandate for the reconstruction, governance and security of Gaza and it is due to go to an Arab League summit on Tuesday. It would then be conveyed to the Trump administration.
But it is a long-term plan predicated on a solid and sustainable end to hostilities. The Israeli government has shown no sign it is ready for that.","['Ibrahim Dahman', 'Tim Lister', 'Tamar Michaelis', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq', 'Dana Karni']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/middleeast/israel-west-bank-displaced-palestinians-intl-latam/index.html,‘Where are we supposed to go?’ Israel’s West Bank campaign leaves families with nowhere to call home,2025-02-28 22:21:50,"Fatima Tawfeeq, 63, has lived through numerous Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank. She witnessed Israel’s takeover of the Palestinian territory in 1967 and lived through Israel’s crackdown during the first and second intifadas, the fierce Palestinian uprisings against Israeli control.
But this is the first time she’s had to flee her home in Nur Shams. She says Israeli forces expelled her from it earlier this month and converted it into a military barracks.
“I’ve never seen this situation before,” she said, speaking to CNN from a wedding hall that has been converted into a makeshift shelter in the nearby town of Kafr al-Labad. “I’ve never seen it like this. Forcibly displacing us? Never. This is the first time.”
Tawfeeq and her family are among roughly 40,000 Palestinians who’ve been displaced from their homes since Israel launched an expanded military campaign in the West Bank in late January, almost immediately after the Gaza ceasefire began.
The Israeli military says it is targeting Palestinian militant groups who have mounted attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, but Palestinians and human rights groups say the expanded assault is increasingly indiscriminate – killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in a manner that is consistent with collective punishment.
Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz has said the current military operation could last until the end of the year and that displaced civilians will not be allowed to return to their homes until the operation is complete.
“I have instructed the IDF to prepare for a prolonged stay in the camps that have been cleared for the coming year – and not to allow residents to return and terrorism to grow again,” Katz said on Sunday.
‘Where are we supposed to go?’
Tawfeeq, her husband and several of her grandchildren are living alongside other families, among piled up bedrolls and blankets that have been strung up to create family “rooms.” There is no central heating, and the inside of the concrete building they share feels even colder than outside.
Her 11-year-old grandson Mahmoud passes the time by jumping from a stage in the hall next to their makeshift quarters onto the bedrolls below.
But he misses home and recalled the moment Israeli forces ordered his family and their neighbors to leave their homes at around 2:30 a.m. earlier this month.
“The Israeli military came and started calling on the loudspeakers,” he said. “So everyone started to gather their belongings and started leaving.”
Mahmoud’s mother rushed him out of the house.
“I didn’t have time to pack anything,” he said. “I didn’t take anything with me. I left with the clothes I am wearing today.”
As Mahmoud recounts the events of that night, his 9-year-old sister Rou’ya begins to tear up. Amid the trauma of their displacement, their mother has had to leave them to take their younger brother to the hospital.
“I want mama,” Rou’ya says, crying.
Rou’ya explains that she was terrified of the military. She had never seen Israeli soldiers up close before and feared that the soldiers would take their home and give it to Israeli settlers.
Their grandmother, forced from her own home, worries what a year-long operation will mean for her and her family, becoming emotional as she thinks of being separated from her other grandchildren.
“Eventually, they will hold wedding parties and we will need to leave. Where are we supposed to go?” Tawfeeq asked. “An entire year is difficult.”
The prospect of prolonged displacement is also straining the resources of communities like Kafr al-Labad that have taken in some of those forced from their homes.
“We are trying to provide for these needs with the support of local families and benefactors, but frankly, this issue is a significant burden and challenge,” Amin Barghoush, a municipal representative of Kafr al-Labad, said.
He said support from the Palestinian Authority, which partially controls the West Bank, has been minimal and his community’s goodwill is being stretched amid the prospect of a prolonged crisis.
“Tulkarem Governorate has become one of the most affected areas. We might have one of the highest refugee populations in the country,” he said. “What we are witnessing is comprehensive destruction, an economic blockade and the devastation of infrastructure in the refugee camps.”
Widespread destruction
The road into the Nur Shams camp, established to house Palestinian refugees in 1952, is now unrecognizable. The pavement has been dug up by the Israeli military’s D-9 bulldozers – mounds of asphalt and dirt piled up on the sides of roads, often pouring into shops and homes. Sewage seeps into the muddy streets.
Inside the camp, the destruction is even more stark. Some residential buildings have been demolished; a hole is punched into the side of a mosque; chunks of broken concrete now bare the inside of someone’s home to the outside world.
In sections of the camp – and the same can be said of Jenin and Tulkarem camps – the destruction is reminiscent of what the Israeli military has wrought on the Gaza Strip.
Indeed, Israel’s military operations in the West Bank are increasingly resembling those in Gaza. Drone strikes and airstrikes are now regularly carried out here where they were once a rarity. And for the first time in more than two decades, the Israeli military this week deployed tanks to the West Bank.
In Jenin camp, the Israeli military has conducted dozens of controlled explosions, destroying buildings where it says its troops located explosives and other “terrorist infrastructure.” It is a claim Jenin’s mayor Mohammad Jarrar disputes, saying many were residential buildings where dozens of families lived.
Israeli forces have killed 66 people in the West Bank since the start of the latest operation on January 21, according to figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and local officials say the majority of those killed have been civilians.
The Israeli military says it is targeting militants and said Friday that it has killed “70 terrorists” since the beginning of the operation.
The overall impact of the Israeli operation on civilians, though, is indisputable.
Inside the chilly wedding hall, Rou’ya longs for the toys she would arrange in her room before reading them stories. Mahmoud says he craves the privacy of his own bedroom. They both want to go home.
“Even if they demolish our house, we will rebuild it,” Mahmoud said. “The camp is better. We have our family and our friends.”","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Abeer Salman', 'Kareem Khadder']",en

Eli Sharabi was released earlier this month along with Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy as part of the Gaza ceasefire and hostages agreement between Israel and Hamas.
The 52-year-old Sharabi said his captors had not told him that his wife Lianne and daughters Noiya and Yahel were killed during the 2023 attack. Instead, he learned of their fate after his release.
In an emotional televised interview that aired Thursday on Israeli Channel 12’s “Uvda” program conducted by Israeli journalist Ilana Dayan, he recalled the moment he was taken by the Red Cross to an Israel Defense Forces post where psychologists and a family friend, a social worker, awaited. “I said, ‘Bring me my wife and the girls,’” Sharabi recalled. “She told me, ‘Osnat (his sister) and Mom are waiting for you.”
Choking back tears, Sharabi added: “It was clear that there’s no need to tell. Because at that moment, she had already told me. It’s clear that the worst has happened.”
“I really hope they didn’t feel pain in their last moments. That it happened fast and wasn’t painful. I hope they are in a good place,” he added, his voice breaking.
Sharabi also shed light on the plight of the remaining hostages, including his close friend Alon Ohel with whom he had shared a tunnel and formed an “unbreakable bond.”
Sharabi said hostages were given one meal a day – often a bowl of pasta or half a pita – totaling just 250-300 calories. “We’d cut the pita into four pieces and nibble one slice for 10 minutes, pretending it was enough,” Sharabi said, adding that he dreamed of his mother’s cooking. “You dream of opening a fridge … taking an egg, a vegetable, water. That’s freedom.”
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem told CNN on Friday that the group denies Sharabi’s allegations.
“We dealt with the prisoners in accordance with international law,” Qassem said, adding that Hamas had “provided them with food at a time when there was a famine in the Strip.”
The Channel 12 interview concluded with a plea from Sharabi: “People must understand – every hostage is someone’s child, parent, sibling. Don’t forget them.”
The ceasefire deal has seen the release of 38 hostages held by Hamas, five of whom were freed separately to the deal, as well as thousands of Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel.
The first phase of the truce is set to end this weekend and negotiators are yet to agree on what comes next.","['Lauren Izso', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq', 'Dana Karni']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/middleeast/israel-gaza-truce-first-phase-intl/index.html,The first phase of Gaza’s truce could end in hours. What comes next will be more difficult,2025-02-28 13:06:36,"It was improbable from the start.
For months, even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted he wanted to bring the hostages home from Gaza, he resisted signing a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Sustained pressure from thousands-strong marches could not get him to the signing table.
But the combined pressure of the outgoing and incoming American presidents got Netanyahu to agree to a 42-day truce for the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners, and an infusion of aid into Gaza. (Ultimately, 38 hostages were released over 39 days.)
The agreement he did ultimately sign, then-US President Joe Biden argued, was essentially the same deal that had been on the table for nearly a year.
The final, 42nd-day of that truce is Saturday. The ceasefire agreement stipulates that the truce can continue so long as negotiators are talking, so it may well hobble on. But as tough as negotiations for the first phase were, whatever comes next will be much more difficult.
Phase two of a ceasefire, which is supposed to last another 42 days, would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the release of all living hostages held by Hamas – estimated to number 24 men – in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
But talks about what comes next have only just begun, and Netanyahu has made it increasingly clear that he has no interest in that framework.
For one thing, phase two would mean a declaration that the war is over. “That’s not going to happen – ever,” an Israeli source told CNN. “They’ll keep it as vague as possible.”
Netanyahu blew past the February 3 deadline to send a negotiating team to talk about phase two, choosing instead to visit US President Donald Trump in Washington. At the 11th hour, on Thursday, he announced that he would send a team to Cairo – but without its chief negotiator, his close political ally, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.
On Thursday, an Israeli official told CNN that the military would continue to occupy the critical Gaza-Egypt border, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, past the first phase of the ceasefire when it ends on Saturday. Under the terms of an elusive second phase, Israel was meant to start withdrawing there on that day and finish in eight days, according to Hamas.
The US envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told CNN that he hopes to get an extension of phase one in order to negotiate phase two.
“We are committed to the release of all hostages, and we will continue to search for different ways to do so,” Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Thursday while meeting with his Czech counterpart. There was no mention of the fact that that framework exists – agreed to in the Qatari capital in January.
Hamas has repeatedly committed itself to the ceasefire. Despite walking close to the edge when it sent to Israel the body of an unknown Palestinian woman instead of Shiri Bibas – mistakenly, the group says – it has largely stuck to the agreement.
But it has yet to answer the big question: Will it disarm and leave Gaza?
Hamas’s leaders, scattered between Gaza and across the region, are bullish one moment and conciliatory the next – but have consistently refused to engage on the question of disarmament.
Hamas “was not erased” by the war, Osama Hamdan, a member of the group’s political bureau, said in Qatar last week. “Whoever comes to fill Israel’s place (in Gaza) will be treated like Israel.” Hamas, he said, has “an opportunity to expand.”
Hazam Qassem, a spokesperson for the group, said that week that he was “surprised” by a suggestion from an Arab League official that the “resignation of Hamas represents the interest of the Palestinian people.”
And yet on Wednesday, another political bureau official, Husam Badran, said that the group was willing to step aside from governing Gaza. “Our only condition is for this to be an internal Palestinian matter – we will not allow any regional or international party to get involved,” he told Al Arabiya. “As long as there is national consensus, Hamas will not be involved in the governance.”
Netanyahu still refuses to say what he envisions for Gaza’s post-war future, except to say that he endorses Trump’s plan for “a different Gaza” – the emigration of all 2.1 million Palestinians in the enclave, and the construction of a Gulf State-like Xanadu. And he thinks neither the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority nor Hamas should govern Gaza.
Objectionable though it may be, Trump’s plan capitalized on a vacuum of leadership not just from Netanyahu, but in the region. Arab leaders are scrambling to come up with their own vision for rebuilding Gaza – while allowing the Palestinians to remain.
Extending phase one indefinitely would suit an Israeli prime minister whose extremist ministerial allies want to start bombing Gaza again and then re-establish the Jewish settlements that Israel forced out 20 years ago.
That does not mean war is imminent in Gaza.
“There isn’t a desire to relaunch the war,” the Israeli source said. “However there is a desire to go along with the US, hand in hand with the US.”
“There is an understanding in Israel that Trump wants a more regional settlement. So that obviously doesn’t mean that the war will start again right away.”
Netanyahu may seek to get more hostages home while continuing to keep the military massed on Gaza’s borders on a hair trigger.
The question for the coming hours and days will be whether Hamas would agree to give up its most important negotiating asset – hostages – without any commitment to end the war.
“Netanyahu’s plan to extend phase 1 in order to release more hostages without obligating to end the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza will be totally rejected by Hamas,” the longtime former Israeli negotiator-turned-peace activist Gershon Baskin said on Monday.
Hamas’ leaders inside Gaza, he opined, “are becoming increasingly independent from the Hamas leaders outside.” Those exiled leaders, he said, are more willing than the battle-front commanders to resume the war, “with the full awareness that their leverage is the lives of the remaining hostages.”
Those inside Gaza “will not hesitate taking revenge on the hostages if the fighting resumes,” he said. “The war is over, even if Netanyahu fails to recognize it. The alternative to Hamas will be the result of political decisions and not more warfare.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-detained-health-workers-phri-intl/index.html,Rights group PHRI says Israel has systematically abused Palestinian health workers for their profession,2025-02-27 09:35:17,"Editor’s Note: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence and abuse.
Israel has systematically targeted Palestinian healthcare workers in Gaza, arbitrarily detaining them without charge or access to legal counsel, and submitting them to torture and abuse, according to a new report by Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI).
Between July and December, lawyers working with the Israeli nonprofit group said they visited over two dozen Palestinian medical workers, including physicians, nurses and paramedics, aged between at least 21 and 69, who had spent more than six months in isolation after having been seized by Israeli forces.
In the 21-page report released Wednesday, PHRI said that the testimonies from healthcare personnel indicate that their arrests were primarily used by Israel to gather intelligence rather than investigate their alleged involvement in armed conflict or link them to criminal activity.
“This suggests a systemic policy that violates human rights and, more broadly, indicates that such arrests are arbitrary and unlawful under international legal standards,” PHRI said.
PHRI is an Israeli advocacy group made up of medical professionals and rights activists, which describes itself as a political NGO that “believes it is impossible to separate health from politics.” It also provides direct medical services in the Palestinian territories and in Jaffa, according to its website.
“As an Israeli organization, our activity is directed above all at changing the policy in the space where the Israeli government has the power, and is able to change and correct wrongs and prevent human rights violations,” PHRI states on its website.
In 2020, its donors included the United Nations, the European Commission, the US and Swiss embassies, and the Catholic church’s service Secours Catholique, according to the most recent financial report available on PHRI’s website.
The heathcare professionals interviewed by PHRI were held in several facilities run by the Israeli military and the Israel Prison Service (IPS), including Sde Teiman, Ktzi’ot Prison and Nafha Prison, in southern Israel, Petah Tikva in central Israel and Ofer Prison, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Their testimonies suggest detainees were subjected to dehumanizing, near-daily abuse, the group said. Healthcare workers have alleged they experienced sexual abuse, beatings, dog attacks, starvation, sensory overload and had boiling water poured on them.
The Israeli military held more than 250 health workers in Gaza by September, according to Healthcare Workers Watch Palestine, which has been collecting information about medical professionals working in the strip since the war started on October 7, 2023. Over 180 remain in detention, PHRI said.
PHRI called for the immediate release of all detained medical personnel and “guarantees that the fundamental rights and protections of medical workers are upheld.”
The IPS told CNN that it was not aware of the abuse of Palestinian medical workers in its facilities, adding that “all prisoners are detained according to the law” and that “basic rights are provided” by prison guards.
In a statement to CNN, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) rejected claims that it had detained medical workers on the basis of their profession, adding that such allegations ignored what it said was the reality on the ground: the “activity of terrorist organizations in Gaza within medical institutions, and the phenomenon of certain medical staff being involved in terrorist activities.”
It also denied that detainees were held for extended periods without access to legal representation, and said that any concrete allegations of mistreatment of detainees were thoroughly examined and subject to appropriate action.
In its report, PHRI said that the testimonies it gathered suggested medical workers were heavily targeted for their profession and their detention had destructive consequences for Gaza’s healthcare system. More than 15 months of Israeli bombing following the October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel has decimated Gaza’s medical system and killed more than 1,000 health workers, according to the United Nations and the Ministry of Health in the Palestinian enclave.
Many of the healthcare workers said they were interrogated about Israeli hostages, tunnels, weapons, hospitals and Hamas’ activity – some for up to 12 hours and while being beaten or hung from the ceiling. Others told PHRI they were asked about fellow physicians.
Israel says that Hamas has operated inside and underneath hospitals, and used them for its military operations, including as command centers, weapons stores and to hide hostages. Hamas has repeatedly denied the claims.
Palestinians from Gaza are held in Israel under the Unlawful Combatants law, enacted in 2002, which allows authorities to “detain Palestinians from Gaza en masse without charge or trial,” according to Amnesty International. Rights groups and the UN Human Rights Office say their detention for extended periods without charge, access to lawyers or contact with families violates international law.
The Israeli military says this practice is permitted under the Geneva Conventions, which govern the conduct of war, and allow the detention of civilians for security reasons.
Palestinian health workers detail abuse ‘at every stage’
Twenty out of the 24 medical staff interviewed were arrested while carrying out their duties, including at hospitals, PHRI said, accusing Israel of breaching their right to “perform life-saving tasks.” The remaining four were detained at their homes, in displacement camps, or at checkpoints.
Upon their arrest, medical workers told PHRI they were stripped naked, handcuffed, blindfolded, forced to prostrate, and detained for hours to days.
The IDF has previously told CNN that they strip Palestinians they suspect of being Hamas members to make sure they’re not carrying explosives, and that those found not to be affiliated with Hamas are released.
“At every stage, we endured beatings and severe violence — batons, dog attacks, and boiling water poured on us, causing severe burns,” said Dr. N.T., 49, head of surgery at Nasser Hospital, southern Gaza, who was arrested in February 2024 and taken to Sde Teiman, Ofer and Ktzi’ot prisons.
Dr. K.J., a dentist arrested in March by Israeli forces at Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital, where he had sought shelter with his family, said he and other captives were beaten while inside a bus on their way to Sde Teiman. “We were punched, kicked, and hit in the testicles and all over our bodies,” he told PHRI.
Almost all of the detainees PHRI interviewed were taken to Sde Teiman, a shadowy detention center in Israel’s Negev desert. A CNN investigation into the facility released in May, based on interviews with Israeli whistleblowers and former Palestinian detainees, revealed horrific conditions there, including continuous blindfolding and handcuffing, medical negligence and abuse. The investigation sparked an international outcry and was cited as part of an Israeli Supreme Court hearing on conditions at the facility.
Several medics held at Sde Teiman described similar conditions to PHRI, including that soldiers allowed dogs to urinate and defecate on prisoners, and oversaw sexual and psychological torture.
Dr Khaled Alser, a 32-year-old surgeon detained from Nasser Hospital in March, said that he personally examined fellow detainees after they were sexually abused, “including the insertion of batons or electric rods into the buttocks.” PHRI said that Alser was released after seven months in detention without charge.
Responding to CNN’s request for comment on the allegations made in its May report on Sde Teiman, the IDF said in a statement that it “ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody” and that any allegation of misconduct by its soldiers was “examined and dealt with accordingly.”
Other detainees who spoke with PHRI described a method of abuse used in interrogations referred to as the “Disco Room.” Three Palestinians health workers said they were held in a space with bright lights and loud music to sensorily overload them before being bombarded with questions like: “Where are the hostages,” or “Where are the tunnel entrances.”
Guards escalated the brutality of their beatings in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, several eyewitnesses told PHRI.
PHRI said that Palestinian health workers also described “pervasive medical neglect” in incarceration, where they said Israeli authorities starved detainees, restricted access to showers, and ignored requests for drugs.
One nurse said they had lost more than 25 kilograms over 11 months in detention.
One doctor told PHRI they attempted to care for their fellow detainees by improvising surgeries using pieces of plastic disinfected with bleach. In other cases, they said they witnessed limbs being amputated, while others died from their injuries.
An orthopedic specialist said he tried to appeal to an Israeli doctor’s collegial solidarity, only to be slapped and called a “terrorist.”
Meanwhile, PHRI said that some prisoners they interviewed were flatly denied legal representation, forced to sign testimony documents in Hebrew, or denied access to evidence of alleged crimes and “credible, translated” testimony in their native language. Others were given truncated court hearings without a lawyer present, the organization said. A handful of medics said they were told they would be held in detention, even though there was no indictment against them.
A surgeon detained in Ofer Prison told PHRI he had a court hearing on the sixtieth day of his detention in April. “I was left waiting in the sun for eight hours, during which soldiers beat me, threw stones at me, and spat on me,” said a 42-year-old surgeon listed in the report as Dr. A.M., who PHRI says was arrested at Nasser Hospital, southern Gaza.
“At the hearing, they stated, ‘There is no indictment against you, but you will remain in detention until the war is over,’” he said.",['Sana Noor Haq'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/middleeast/israel-idf-intelligence-failures-hamas-report-intl-latam/index.html,Investigation highlights Israeli intelligence failures in lead-up to Hamas’ October 7 attack,2025-02-27 23:25:34,"An investigation into the failings of the Israeli military in the lead-up to the devastating Hamas attack of October 7, 2023, has highlighted gaps in intelligence gathering, flawed assumptions about Hamas, and “systemic” failures in the Israel Defense Force’s preparedness and response.
The 19-page report released Thursday by the IDF said there were gaps in the Intelligence Directorate’s understanding of “Hamas’ strategic goals, decision-making processes,” and operational plans that contributed to its failure to stop the biggest terrorist attack in the country’s history, when gunmen killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage.
Despite having relevant information, the intelligence community failed to recognize Hamas’ shift from a “determined,” and “pragmatic” group to one actively planning a large-scale offensive, it said.
The report said that as early as 2016, Hamas had begun preparing for “a large-scale attack” aimed at breaching the Gaza border, “occupying Israeli territory,” and causing mass casualties.
It identified several instances where intelligence indicators, such as Hamas’ “training exercises” and operational plans, were “misinterpreted” or dismissed as “unrealistic.”
These indicators, had they been properly analyzed, could have revealed Hamas’ intentions, the report said.
Hamas had deliberately created “a false perception of seeking quiet,” while accelerating its military buildup, the report said, adding that by May 2023 the militant group had decided to carry out an attack during a Jewish holiday that would aim “to shatter Israel’s sense of security” and potentially escalate “into an all-out war aimed at destroying Israel.”
When the attack happened, the IDF was “caught off guard” by its scale and intensity and its Gaza Division, responsible for defending the border, was overrun “within hours,” leading to a collapse in command and control.
The IDF’s response was hampered by a lack of “situational awareness,” delayed force mobilization, and insufficient deployment of troops and firepower, found the inquiry, which added that the IDF’s readiness levels were “inadequate” for the scale of the attack.
Israel’s military chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi – who has said he will resign in March over the failure to prevent the attack – addressed the findings in a televised speech, acknowledging the military’s failures and taking responsibility for the lapses.
“This is our learning process. I have received letters and responses, even from people here, saying ‘You…’ and I have no problem with that. I embrace it. My responsibility is mine,” Halevi said.
“I was the commander of the military on October 7, and I have my own responsibility. I also carry the weight of all your responsibility – that, too, I see as mine. And when I see any of my subordinates who made mistakes, I see my own share in it as well,” he added.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief of staff Tzachi Braverman said earlier on Thursday that Netanyahu had yet to receive the investigation.","['Lauren Izso', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-egypt-philadelphi-intl/index.html,Israel says it won’t withdraw from Gaza-Egypt border as it sends team to ceasefire talks,2025-02-27 09:10:29,"Israel will not withdraw its forces from the Gaza-Egypt border as would be required under the second phase of a truce with Hamas, an Israeli source says, even as it dispatches a team for ceasefire negotiations.
“We will not exit the Philadelphi Corridor,” the source told CNN, referring to the 14-kilometer (8-mile) strip along the border. “We will not allow Hamas murderers to roam again with trucks and rifles on our borders, and we will not let them strengthen themselves again through smuggling.”
The announcement comes days before the first phase of the Israel-Hamas hostage-ceasefire agreement is set to expire, and just hours after Hamas handed over the final hostages due for release under the first phase.
Hamas said in a statement that Israel’s failure to withdraw from the Gaza-Egypt border would be “a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement, and an attempt to fabricate excuses to obstruct the ceasefire agreement and causing it to fail.”
Talks on extending the 42-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas into a second phase were meant to have started more than three weeks ago.
As tensions in the region continue to run high, at least nine people were injured Thursday in a car-ramming attack in central Israel, according to emergency responders. Two are in serious condition and one in critical condition, according to the local hospital.
Israeli police are investigating the incident as a terrorist attack and identified a 53-year-old Palestinian man as the attacker, saying he had been killed.
Meanwhile, Israel has steadily escalated an intense military operation in Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank, killing dozens and displacing tens of thousands of residents since the ceasefire agreement came into effect last month.
Talks to continue in Cairo
The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said Thursday that Benjamin Netanyahu was sending a “negotiating delegation to Cairo today to continue the talks.”
It is unclear whether that team will discuss phase two of a ceasefire, which is supposed to include the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, or just an extension of the first phase.
The delegations from Israel and Qatar arrived in Cairo Thursday night, along with American representatives, to continue negotiations, Egypt’s state information services said. Talks have started to discuss the next stages of the truce, it added.
In a sign that talks will not take place at the highest level, the head of Israel’s negotiating team, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, will not be traveling to Cairo for the negotiations, the Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson, Omer Dostri, told CNN.
The first phase – which has seen the release of 38 hostages held by Hamas, five of whom were freed separately to the deal, and thousands of Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel – expires on Saturday.
Netanyahu would prefer to simply extend the ceasefire’s first phase and secure the release of more hostages without having to withdraw from Gaza, an Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN on Tuesday, saying that the government is trying to prolong the first phase “by as much as possible” in the hope of achieving that.
The politician Benny Gantz, a former military chief who quit the unity government last year, accused Netanyahu of acting out of narrow “political interest.”
“The interest of the State of Israel is to bring back as many hostages as quickly as possible,” he said while visiting northern Israel. “One difficult exchange, not drips and drabs.”
Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi told CNN that the withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor was supposed to begin on Saturday, day 42 of the ceasefire, and end on March 9, the 50th day.
The Israeli military took control of the corridor adjacent to the Egyptian border in May. Netanyahu has insisted that controlling the border is critical to Israel’s security.
The second phase of the ceasefire would require Israel to withdraw all its forces from Gaza – including from the Egyptian border. Hamas would then be required to release all living hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.
After handing over the final four deceased hostages due for release overnight into Thursday, Hamas reaffirmed its commitment to start talks on a second phase.
“Any attempts by Netanyahu and his government to backtrack on the agreement and obstruct it will only lead to more suffering for the prisoners and their families,” Hamas said, referring to the hostages.
CNN is asking Egypt, one of the mediators in the truce negotiations, for comment.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/middleeast/arab-gaza-plan-trump-intl-latam/index.html,"Arab countries will give Trump a plan for Gaza ‘within weeks,’ Jordanian official sources say",2025-02-27 20:21:22,"Arab foreign ministers are aiming to travel to Washington “within weeks” to present US President Donald Trump with a “solid” proposal to rebuild Gaza without displacing the Palestinian population, Jordanian official sources told CNN.
Earlier this month, the American president proposed expelling 2.1 million Palestinians from Gaza and transforming the enclave into a “riviera” that would be owned by the United States, a plan that triggered outrage across the Middle East and firm rejections by regional leaders.
Arab leaders are expected to gather for a wider summit in Cairo on March 4 where a “road map” for Gaza and the conflict is expected to be issued. Arab top diplomats are then expected to travel to the US capital in the following weeks to deliver the proposal to the Trump administration, the sources said.
Arab officials want to make sure it is “a solid plan” before presenting it to Trump, one of the sources said.
In addition to laying out a plan for rebuilding the devastated strip without displacing the population, the Arab counterproposal would also address key issues such as governing Gaza after the war, reforming the Palestinian Authority and the deployment of either peacekeeping or peace enforcing forces inside the strip, the sources said.
It’s unclear who the peacekeeping force would be comprised of.
Last week, Arab leaders held a rare “informal” meeting in the Saudi capital Riyadh to discuss the plan – a gathering that the sources said was “significant” and at which there was “a unified stance.”
Jordan and Egypt – two countries that Trump said were candidates for receiving the Palestinians – reject any displacement and consider it a matter of national security.
“Our position is firm and clear and we won’t accept any threat to our national security,” one official said, describing it as a “red line” for Jordan.
For months, officials in Jordan have warned against attempts to displace Palestinians to the country. The Jordanian foreign minister said in September last year after an Israeli escalation in the West Bank that any attempt to displace Palestinians there to Jordan would be considered a “declaration of war.”
Jordanian officials are also concerned about an explosion in violence in the West Bank and Jerusalem during the Holy Month of Ramadan, which is expected to start on Friday or Saturday.
Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly claimed last week that his country could fully rebuild Gaza in three years to a state that is “better than it was before,” without saying how he planned to achieve that. If a permanent ceasefire is reached in Gaza in the coming months, that would mean the vision could be completed before the end of Trump’s presidential term.
The World Bank, the European Union and the United Nations said in a joint statement last week that, according to their estimates, just the return of essential services including health and education, as well as the clearing of rubble, would take three years. The full rebuilding of the devastated enclave would need 10 years and cost more than $50 billion, with housing alone estimated to cost $15 billion. The Egyptian prime minister said that his country’s plan takes those assessments into consideration.","['Jomana Karadsheh', 'Mostafa Salem']",en

“No more tunnels, no more fear,” a voice sings over a dance beat. “Trump Gaza is finally here!”
The American president has proposed expelling 2.1 million Palestinians from Gaza and transforming the enclave into a “Riviera” that would be owned by the United States.
The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority has called that proposal a “serious violation of international law.” The PA foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen, said earlier this month: “We have tried displacement before, and it will not happen again,” referring to the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced during the Arab-Israeli war that led to the creation of Israel in 1948.
The video opens on barefoot Palestinian children walking through Gazan rubble. “What’s next?” a title card asks. They walk towards a skyline of skyscrapers lining Gaza’s coast.
“Donald’s coming to set you free,” a voice sings. “Trump Gaza shining bright. Golden future, a brand-new light. Feast and dance. The deed is done.”
The video, incongruously, features bearded and bikini-clad belly dancers, a child holding a golden balloon in the shape of Trump’s head, and Elon Musk dancing on a beach under a shower of US dollars.
As the Truth Social video ends, the camera pushes in on Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sipping drinks on a beach.
CNN has asked the White House for clarification.
In a statement, Gaza’s Hamas-run Government Media Office denounced the video as “disgraceful.”
“This video and its degrading content reflect the deeply rooted racist colonial mindset that seeks to distort reality and justify the occupation’s crimes,” said director-general Ismail Al-Thawabtah. “By portraying Gaza as if it were a land without a people, this desperate attempt aims to legitimize the ongoing ethnic cleansing carried out by the Israeli occupation with clear American support.”
It is unclear whether Trump intends to carry through on his expulsion plan. After receiving forceful pushback from Egyptian and Jordanian leaders, Trump told Fox News on Friday: “The way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it.”
Reacting to the video on Wednesday, Wassel Abu Yousuf, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)’s executive committee, told CNN that the video was “a clowning gimmick and nothing more than that.”
“There will not be resorts or Middle East riviera or anything else,” he said. “What Trump wants to do should be done somewhere else, but not on the backs of the Palestinian people. This is the land of our ancestors and parents, and a lot of blood has been shed to defend it.”
A CNN poll conducted by telephone and online in mid-February found that the proposal for Gaza with no right of return for Palestinians was the least popular Trump action or proposal asked about. Only 13% of Americans in the poll called it a “good thing,” while 58% described it as a “bad thing.”
Alternative Arab plan
Arab leaders met in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Friday for the first time to formulate a response to Trump’s plan for Gaza. The leaders are set to meet in Cairo on March 4 to discuss the plan and will likely present it to Trump at a later date.
A senior United Arab Emirates official said Wednesday that there needs to be a “bold” plan to reconstruct the territory, but said any plan cannot take place without a clear path to a Palestinian state.
The UAE has conducted preliminary discussions about the possibility of playing a role in postwar efforts to rebuild Gaza, but has said that its conditions, including a reformed Palestinian Authority and an Israeli commitment to Palestinian statehood, have not yet been met.
Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the prospects of an independent Palestinian state and has endorsed Trump’s Gaza ownership plan.
“The conclusion is we need a bold plan of reconstruction but that plan of reconstruction must ensure that we don’t go back to a situation of conflict and to do that we have to have a clear path where the Palestinians actually have a state,” the UAE’s diplomatic adviser to the president Anwar Gargash told CNN’s Becky Anderson at an investment conference in Abu Dhabi.
Egypt, one of the countries Trump suggested should take in Gazans, has led the Arab effort to formulate an alternative plan for the enclave, which its prime minister has claimed would take three years to complete and cost $20 billion.
Asked by CNN whether Egypt, as a major recipient of US aid, feels coerced by Trump to accept his plan, Hassan El Khatib, the Egyptian minister of investment, said: “The right for the Palestinians to live on their own land is a principle… No we’re not going to take pressure on this.”

The Egyptian-brokered agreement between Hamas and Israel will see the exchange of the final four bodies of hostages due to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire deal for the 620 Palestinian prisoners and detainees that should have been freed last Saturday, according to the Israeli source. Among the detainees are 23 children and one woman.
Israel had delayed their release in protest of what it said is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas and demanding guarantees that future hostage releases would take place without “humiliating ceremonies.”
Advocates for Palestinians prisoners and detainees, in turn, have expressed repeated concerns about the delay, and Israel’s treatment of those held in detention. The Palestinian Prisoner’s Society says 69 Palestinian prisoners have died in Israeli detention since the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, of whom 38 were detained in Gaza.
Hamas released six Israeli hostages from Gaza on Saturday in two public ceremonies and one private transfer, in what was the final return of living hostages in the first phase of a ceasefire deal that began last month.
Hamas accused Israel of violating the truce with the delay, casting some uncertainty over the precarious ceasefire deal, and said talks on a second phase would not be possible until they are freed.
Hamas confirmed that an agreement with Israel had been made through Egyptian mediators, but did not specify how many Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees would be released.
An Egyptian official confirmed the agreement between Israel and Hamas was reached, according to a statement by the Egyptian government’s media office.
The Israeli official confirmed to CNN that the release of the remains of four hostages held in Gaza could happen as early as Wednesday evening.
Hamas and its allies continue to hold 63 hostages in Gaza. At least 36 of those are believed to be dead, according to the Israeli government – one of whom, the soldier Hadar Goldin, has been held since 2014.
The 42-day truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire this weekend unless an agreement is struck to extend it. The two sides were meant to begin talks on a permanent end to the war in early February, but those discussions have not begun yet.
Funeral for slain hostages
The latest agreement between Israel and Hamas came as mourners in southern Israel lined the streets ahead of a funeral Wednesday for Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Kfir and Ariel, who were taken hostage in the October 7 Hamas-led attack and killed in Gaza.
Their bodies were returned to Israel last week under the ceasefire arrangement.
The Bibas family invited the public to gather along the funeral route to pay their respects to the two children and their mother ahead of a private ceremony near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel.
At just nine months, Kfir was the youngest person kidnapped and held hostage in Gaza. Along with his brother, Ariel, who was four, they became prominent symbols of the plight of the hostages held in Gaza throughout the war.
Their father Yarden Bibas, who was also taken hostage, was released on February 1 after 484 days of captivity as part of the ceasefire agreement.
The return of Shiri, Kfir and Ariel’s bodies last week caused much pain and consternation in Israel after the remains of Kfir and Ariel were returned without their mother, as promised, but rather with the body of an unidentified Palestinian woman – a development which threatened to derail the fragile ceasefire agreement.
Shiri’s remains were later returned to Israel.
Crowds gathered along the funeral route held Israeli and yellow flags, symbolizing the campaign to bring the hostages home, as a procession for the two young boys and their mother passed.
“We are accompanied by the people of Israel in droves,” the Bibas family said in a statement shared by the Israeli hostage families forum. “We see and hear you” and “are moved and strengthened by you,” it said.

One month ago, Israelis and Palestinians felt that rarest of things: optimism.
After months of stalled talks, there was finally a ceasefire in Gaza. There seemed to be a real path towards the end of the war.
But the situation has changed drastically since then.
The 42-day truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire this weekend unless an agreement is struck to extend it. The two sides were meant to begin talks on a permanent end to the war in early February; three weeks later, they still haven’t started.
Since the deal was struck, there’s been a vibe shift in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is buoyed by the return of US President Donald Trump and under pressure from far-right members of his own cabinet to return to war. The Gaza ceasefire looks increasingly like it may end up being a fleeting interlude.
“We are ready to return to intense combat at any moment,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told graduating military officers on Sunday. “The operational plans are ready.”
Netanyahu made his tenuous commitment to the ceasefire clear when he traveled to Washington DC to meet Trump earlier this month and opted not to send a negotiating team to Qatar or Egypt, which mediated the ceasefire.
He has replaced Israel’s security chiefs, who previously led ceasefire negotiations, with a close political ally – his minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, who is said to be close to the Trump administration. Israeli media last week was briefed by a “senior official” castigating the security chief-led negotiating team for giving Hamas too much in previous talks.
Even during the initial ceasefire negotiations it was clear that Netanyahu was skeptical of its potential second phase.
The first phase was always temporary for him. It was a way to get some hostages home without permanently ending the war or having to talk about what Gaza will look like once it’s over. Nearly 17 months since October 7, he has yet to present his vision for Gaza’s future, except to say that neither Hamas nor the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority should govern.
The second phase was always going to be trickier. It would see Hamas and Israel agree to a permanent end to hostilities, the release of all living Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, including from the Gaza-Egypt border.
Netanyahu is under tremendous pressure to return to war. His finance minister, the far-right-winger Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to withdraw from the governing coalition if Israel doesn’t restart the war after this weekend. Itamar Ben Gvir quit his post as national security minister over the ceasefire.
Netanyahu is trying to extend the current terms of the ceasefire without any of the tough commitments required by a potential second phase. An Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN Tuesday that the government is trying to extend the first phase “by as much as possible” in the hope of releasing more hostages.
It is unclear whether Hamas, for whom the hostages are their most valuable asset, would continue releasing Israelis without an Israeli commitment to end the war.
Though Trump championed and took credit for the ceasefire, his messaging since taking office has hardly been that of a peacemaker. He’s proposed expelling Palestinians from Gaza, he’s considering some Israelis’ desire to annex the West Bank, and he’s expressed doubt about the fate of the ceasefire. “I can’t tell you whether or not the cease fire will hold,” he said earlier this month. “We are going to see whether or not it holds.”
Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, is returning to the region this week to try to save the ceasefire. He hardly expressed optimism when he spoke with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at a Saudi investment conference in Miami last week. “Phase two is more difficult,” Witkoff said. “But I think ultimately if we work hard that there’s a real chance of success.”
Hours after Hamas released six Israeli hostages this weekend, Israel’s cabinet said it wasn’t going to uphold its end of the exchange – the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
The Israeli government and many international observers have expressed horror at the Hamas’ propaganda ceremonies staged to hand hostages to the Red Cross. It appears two incidents last week – the initial failure to hand over Shiri Bibas’ body and the staging of dead Israelis’ coffins under the banner of a bloodsucking Netanyahu – were a step too far. Hamas would have to stop “the humiliating ceremonies,” the prime minister’s office said.
Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif Al-Qanou called Israel’s decision not to release the prisoners a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement.
Critics of the Israeli government point out that Israel, too, has staged propaganda campaigns. Palestinian detainees released by Israel – some of whom have committed serious crimes, but most of whom were held without charge – have been made to wear sweatshirts upon their release with a Star of David and the Arabic phrase: “We don’t forget or forgive.” Others have said that they were made to watch hours of Israeli propaganda videos ahead of their release.
The future of the ceasefire now seems to come down to a simple calculation. Will Hamas see enough value in a short-lived peace to continue releasing hostages without long-term commitments from Israel? And if not, will the American government pressure Israel into the concessions necessary for a second phase?
Two million Palestinians struggling to survive depend on the answer. So too do the 63 hostages who remain in Gaza – just under half of whom are thought to be alive.
“Please, I just want to go home,” Evyatar David, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, said Saturday in a Hamas propaganda video as he watched hostages handed to the Red Cross. Though he was likely speaking under duress, David’s family authorized the video’s release.
“The time has come to end it,” he said. “You started something, finish it. Please.”

Here’s why that’s significant,2025-02-23 00:00:00,"The Israeli military this weekend deployed tanks to the occupied West Bank for the first time in two decades.
In the background of a Gaza ceasefire, Israel has steadily escalated an intense military operation in Palestinian cities in the West Bank, killing dozens and displacing tens of thousands of residents.
Since Hamas’ October 7 attack, Israel has regularly launched airstrikes on the West Bank, which was almost unheard of before. Its defense minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that he’d instructed the military to stay for a year and “to prevent the return of residents.”
US President Donald Trump has come under withering criticism for his proposal to expel 2.1 million Palestinians from Gaza. And yet, as the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz alleged in an editorial Monday, “Israel is already doing in the West Bank what it threatens to do in Gaza.”
Here’s what’s happening.
What is the West Bank?
The West Bank, a territory that lies west of the Jordan River between Israel and Jordan, has been occupied by the Israeli military since 1967. It is home to more than 3.3 million Palestinians.
Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem – including the Old City, with its religious landmarks – from Jordan after a brief war in 1967. Many Israelis believe that Jews have a biblical right to the land, which they call Judea and Samaria.
Since Israel captured the West Bank, around half a million Jewish Israelis have built homes in towns known as “settlements.” Because the West Bank is considered to be occupied under international law, these settlements are illegal, but they are condoned – and even encouraged – by the Israeli government.
In the 1990s, Israel and Palestinian factions started a peace process, which came to be known as the Oslo Accords. The agreement set up a Palestinian government, known as the Palestinian Authority, which would have jurisdiction in parts of the West Bank and Gaza, ahead of the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
Many communities in Palestinian cities are known as refugee camps. Though they now resemble urban neighborhoods, they were established after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war for Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes during the creation of Israel.
In July, the International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ top court, issued an unprecedented advisory opinion that found Israel’s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to be illegal, and called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation.
What has happened since October 7?
There has always been tension between Palestinians and the Israeli government in the West Bank. Israel has for many years carried out regular incursions into Palestinian communities – targeting, it says, Palestinian militants.
But Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel ushered in a new era.
The Israeli military ramped up its restrictions on Palestinians, setting up new checkpoints and restricting who could cross from the West Bank into Israel. There was a spike of attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinians, killing dozens.
Israel launched a major military incursion in the northern West Bank in August, which it called “Operation Summer Camps.” It sent armored vehicles into the cities of Jenin and Tulkarem, severing water and electricity and leading Palestinians to ration food, residents told CNN.
Armored Israeli bulldozers often rip up tarmacked roads during these incursions. Israel argues it’s a necessary tactic to unearth improvised explosive devices, but it often leaves whole neighborhoods entirely impassable.
Israel has also targeted other aspects of Palestinian life in the West Bank. The Knesset, the country’s parliament, passed a law last year that would make it extremely difficult for the United Nations’ agency for Palestinians to continue operations, alleging that UNRWA, as it’s known, hasn’t done enough to crack down on extremism in its ranks. UNRWA educates 45,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and provides nearly a million annual patient visits at 43 health care facilities.
What’s happening now?
Israel launched an even more aggressive military operation in the northern West Bank in January, focused on the Jenin refugee camp, dubbed “Operation Iron Wall.” Israel says the operation is necessary to root out Iranian-backed militants who threaten its security.
The defense minister has said that Israel is applying its Gaza playbook to the West Bank.
“A powerful operation to eliminate terrorists and terror infrastructure in the camp, ensuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over – the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza,” Katz said last month.
Israel’s operation has forced more than 40,000 Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank, according to the United Nations. The military has killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7, 2023, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Among those are at least 184 children. Just this weekend, the Israeli military admitted its forces had killed two 13-year-old children, and that it was investigating the incidents.
Jenin’s mayor told CNN that Israel’s military had razed at least 120 residential buildings and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in destruction. “I believe this operation from the beginning was a political agenda disguised and wrapped in a military and security operation,” Mohammad Jarrar said earlier this month. “But it’s very clear – we all know the goals of this far-right government policy.”
Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, told reporters in Brussels on Monday that “it’s military operations taking place there against terrorists and (there are) no other objectives but this one.”
What role does Trump play?
It is impossible to ignore the role of Trump. His election has emboldened those in Israel who want the government to extend full Israeli sovereignty to West Bank settlements, a process known as annexation. Some want to go even further and annex all of the West Bank.
Trump said earlier this month that “people do like the idea” of annexation, “but we haven’t taken a position on it yet.”
“But we’ll be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks,” he said.
Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who is in charge of West Bank settlements, ordered preparations for annexation, saying that Trump’s election “brings an important opportunity for the state of Israel.” The only way to remove the “threat” of a Palestinian state, he said, “is to apply Israeli sovereignty over the entire settlements in Judea and Samaria.”
The finance minister seems to play a big role in Netanyahu’s more aggressive approach. Smotrich was against the Gaza ceasefire and is pushing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to return to war there. He is a West Bank settler himself. In January, Smotrich said that the government now considers security in the West Bank to be an official “war goal.”
“After Gaza and Lebanon, today, with God’s help, we have begun to change the security concept in Judea and Samaria,” he said.
How did things change this weekend?
Israel’s invasion of Jenin refugee camp was already a significant escalation. But this weekend it became clear that it had no end in sight.
On Friday, Netanyahu visited Jenin and praised the “wonderful job” troops were doing. A photo circulated of him sitting with commanders inside a Palestinian home that the military requisitioned as a command center.
“We are eliminating terrorists, commanders,” he said. “We are doing very, very important work against the desire of Hamas and other terrorist elements to harm us.”
Then on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deployed a tank platoon to Jenin – the first time tanks have been sent into the West Bank since 2002, during the Second Intifada, or uprising. It’s a sign of just how militarized the operation there has become. The Israeli military no longer believes that ground troops – and even airstrikes – are enough.
And while Trump and Israel’s extremist ministers make plans to expel Gaza’s population, Israel’s defense minister Katz announced that the tens of thousands of Palestinians who have left their West Bank homes in recent weeks will not be allowed to return.
“Today, I instructed the IDF to prepare for an extended presence in the cleared camps for the next year, and not to allow the return of residents and the resurgence of terror,” he said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement Monday that it was “deeply concerned” by the impact of Israel’s West Bank operations on civilians.
“Displaced civilians in the northern West Bank require urgent assistance,” it said, highlighting that many people are struggling to access essentials including clean water, food, shelter and medical care.
“The ICRC reiterates that the population shall be treated humanely and protected from violence,” it said.

Israel has been carrying out “Operation Iron Wall” – a military campaign focused on the northern West Bank which launched last month, just two days after the Gaza ceasefire began.
On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deployed a tank platoon to the northern West Bank city of Jenin, as Defense Minister Israel Katz said he had ordered the military “to prepare for prolonged presence” in Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank for the “coming year,” and to “prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism.”
Katz said that three camps – Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nur Shams – were now empty of some 40,000 residents after being “evacuated.” Several residents who fled Jenin refugee camp previously told CNN the Israeli military had ordered them to evacuate and they did not know when they would be allowed to return home.
At least 27 people have been killed in the offensive in Jenin and 70 across the West Bank since the beginning of the year, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Earlier this week, Israeli forces demolished more than a dozen apartment buildings at a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian official told CNN.
Israeli tanks were last sent into the West Bank in 2002 as part of “Operation Defensive Shield” during the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, the Israeli military told CNN.
The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS) said on Monday that at least 365 Palestinians have been detained by Israel in Jenin and Tulkarem since the operation began on January 21. The figure includes those who remain in custody as well as those released, PPS said, adding that children, women, young men, the injured, and the elderly are among those arrested.
At least 14,500 Palestinians have been arrested across the entire West Bank since October 2023, according to the PPS, saying that “this is collective punishment.”
CNN has reached out to Israeli authorities for comment.
‘Escalating aggression’
The Israeli military meanwhile said Sunday that it was operating in “additional towns” in the Jenin area.
Jenin Mayor Mohammad Jarrar told CNN that Israeli forces have destroyed private property and infrastructure in the area including more than 100 residential buildings, each consisting of multiple apartments. Hundreds of other residential buildings have been partially destroyed, he said.
“If the world stays silent we are afraid this will continue for the rest of the West Bank,” Jarrar said.
A social media video seen by CNN that cannot be independently verified shows what appears to be a military bulldozer digging a road in what is said to be the Jenin area on Monday morning.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
The Israeli military has launched regular incursions into Jenin and its refugee camps in recent years but has not established a permanent presence in the immediate area. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967 but was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority in 1995 as a result of the Oslo Accords.
Since Hamas’ October 7 attack, Israel has engaged in an increasingly militarized campaign that it says targets West Bank militants, employing tactics like airstrikes that were once nearly unheard of there.
The Palestinian foreign ministry said Israel’s “deployment of heavy tanks” was a “step towards escalating its aggression and expanding its crimes against the Palestinian people, especially in the northern West Bank and its refugee camps.”
In a statement, the ministry “emphasized the urgent need for international intervention to curb the aggression of the occupation, which is carried out without regard for laws or signed agreements, and to compel it to cease its aggression against the Palestinian people and their rights, foremost of which is their right to remain on their land.”
Israeli Defense Minister Katz said Sunday the Israeli military is “conducting offensive operations to eliminate terrorist strongholds, neutralizing militants, and destroying terror infrastructure, buildings, and weapons caches on a large scale.”
He vowed to “continue clearing refugee camps and other terror hubs to dismantle the battalions and terror infrastructure of radical Islam.”
“We will not return to the previous reality,” he said.
The Palestinian foreign ministry has dismissed such justifications as “pretexts” to bring the territory under Israeli control.
In November, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich – who is in charge of Jewish settlements in the West Bank – ordered preparations for the annexation of the settlements, saying that US President Donald Trump’s victory “brings an important opportunity for the state of Israel.”
Palestinians want the West Bank, as well as Gaza and occupied East Jerusalem, for a future independent state. Jewish settlements there are considered illegal under international law.

Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office confirmed the postponement, demanding guarantees that future hostage releases will take place without “humiliating ceremonies.”
Hamas released six Israeli hostages from Gaza on Saturday in two public ceremonies and one private transfer, the final return of live hostages in this first phase of a ceasefire deal that began last month. The next release, of the remains of four more hostages, is expected Thursday.
In return for Saturday’s release, Israel was expected to free 620 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including 23 children and one woman. But Israeli officials delayed that release, citing further security reviews.
Hamas’ media office had earlier accused Israel of violating the truce with the delay, casting some uncertainty over the precarious ceasefire deal.
The delay, announced in the early hours of Sunday local time, is a response to Hamas’s “repeated violations” of the deal, according to the Prime Minister’s Office, including using hostages in videos and public displays that “demean their dignity.”
Hamas had released a heavily edited propaganda video showing two unreleased Israeli captives watching Saturday’s hostage release ceremony from a vehicle. The hostages seen in the video – identified by the Hostages and Missing Families’ Forum as Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa Dalal – plead for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure their freedom. The men were likely speaking under duress.
The two men’s families authorized media use of “the sickening Hamas video,” according to the forum.
Hamas and its allies continue to hold 63 Israeli hostages in Gaza. At least 32 of those are believed to be dead, according to the Israeli government – one of whom, the soldier Hadar Goldin, has been held since 2014.
The first two hostages to be released on Saturday – Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38 – were turned over to Red Cross officials in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Shoham was kidnapped from kibbutz Be’eri during the Hamas-led attack of October 7, 2023, along with his two children, wife, and mother-in-law, all of whom were released the following month. Mengistu, an Israeli from Ashkelon, crossed into Gaza in 2014.
Later, thousands of people including Hamas fighters gathered at a separate location in Nuseirat, central Gaza, where three of the hostages – Eliya Cohen, 27, Omer Shem Tov, 22, and Omer Wenkert, 23 – were handed over in another heavily choreographed ceremony. A number of children appeared on the stage wearing shirts bearing photographs of Hamas leaders who had been killed.
The three men were kidnapped at the Nova music festival near the border with Gaza during the October 7 attack. They appeared thin but in better condition than some previously freed hostages, whose appearance sparked alarm in Israel. Shem Tov seemed to engage with some of the Hamas fighters on stage and blew a kiss toward the crowd.
A sixth hostage, 37-year-old Hisham al-Sayed, an Arab-Israeli from a Bedouin community in southern Israel who walked into Gaza in 2015, was turned over to the Red Cross in Gaza City, according to an Israeli security source and a Hamas source.
Al-Sayed and Mengistu both reportedly have serious mental health conditions. They were captured by Hamas about a decade ago.
The Israeli military said the hostages had crossed into Israel and would receive medical assessments before being reunited with their families.
Crowds gathered in Tel Aviv’s “Hostage Square” to witness the releases on screen, some waving to the sky as a helicopter carrying Mengistu passed overhead.
Just before being handed over to the Red Cross in Rafah early on Saturday morning, Shoham and Mengistu were paraded on stage, flanked by armed and masked militants. They were handed documents, and Shoham was forced to address the crowd.
In contrast, al-Sayed received a quieter handover, which one leading Bedouin figure in Israel said showed Hamas’ respect of “the Palestinians in the occupied territories.”
Many from this often marginalized community – one of several ethnic minority groups in Israel – identify distinctly as Bedouin Israelis, while others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel.
Hundreds of Palestinians waiting to be released
Throughout the day, crowds of Palestinians waited under heavy rain in front of Gaza’s European Hospital in Khan Younis, anticipating the eventual arrival of their loved ones. As the hours passed, some trickled out of the hospital while others slept in the hospital corridors in hopes of waiting out the delay.
According to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, 620 prisoners were expected to be released from Israeli detention on Saturday – a slightly higher figure than previously reported and the largest number of Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged since the ceasefire deal began.
Just under 500 of those are expected to be sent back to Gaza, including 445 who were detained in the enclave since the war began in October 2023 and have been held without charge, as well as 23 children and one woman, according to the group.
In addition, 151 prisoners serving life sentences and long sentences were due to be released to the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and some sent into exile.
According to prison authorities, a senior Israeli prisons official, Lt. Col. Kobi Yaakovi, ordered the Palestinian prisoners to wear clothes that included the inscription: “I have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them; neither did I turn back till they were consumed.”
‘Joyful moment’ accompanied by ‘deep pain’
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Saturday’s hostage release was a “moving and joyful moment” but was accompanied by “deep pain over the fate of Shiri Bibas and her sons.”
The remains of Bibas – the Israeli mother whose young family became a symbol for the plight of hostages being held in Gaza – had been expected to be among those of four hostages returned by Hamas on Thursday, alongside her sons Kfir and Ariel, and another captive, Oded Lifshitz.
However, while forensic tests confirmed that the remains included those of the two boys and Lifshitz, the fourth body was not that of Shiri Bibas – and nor did it match that of any other Israeli hostage, prompting demands for the correct remains to be returned.
On Friday evening, Bibas’ remains arrived in Tel Aviv following condemnation in Israel.
“Last night, our Shiri was brought home. After the identification process at the Institute for Forensic Medicine, we received the news this morning that we had feared: our Shiri was murdered in captivity,” said a statement from her family provided by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum on Saturday.
Hamas, which says Shiri and the two boys were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2023, said that her body may have earlier been mixed up with the body of another person killed in the airstrike, and vowed to investigate.
Israel and Hamas are holding indirect negotiations to extend the ceasefire. Those talks began more than two weeks late.

Bibas’ remains had been expected to be among those of four hostages returned by Hamas on Thursday, alongside her sons, Kfir and Ariel, and another captive, Oded Lifshitz. The boys were 9 months old and 4 years old, respectively, when they were taken captive.
However, while forensic tests by Israeli authorities confirmed that the remains included those of the two boys and Lifshitz, the fourth body was not that of Shiri Bibas – and nor did it match that of any other Israeli hostage, prompting outrage and condemnation.
Now, her body has been returned to Israel, according to the forum.
“Last night, our Shiri was brought home. After the identification process at the Institute for Forensic Medicine, we received the news this morning that we had feared: our Shiri was murdered in captivity,” the statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said, quoting the Bibas family.
“She has returned home to her sons, her husband, her sister, and all her family to rest,” the statement added.
CNN has contacted the Israeli government for official confirmation of the results of the forensic examination.
Shiri’s husband and the children’s father, Yarden Bibas, was released by Hamas earlier this month after 484 days of captivity.
Opposition party leader Yair Lapid called the return of Bibas’ remains “a long and painful closing of a circle.”
“I share in the pain and sorrow of the family and friends. We so hoped for a different ending,” Lapid said in a post on Telegram.
Kibbutz Nir Oz, the community where Bibas was taken hostage along with her husband and children in the Hamas-led attack of October 7, expressed its “deep sorrow” in a statement Saturday.
“Today, after 16 unbearably difficult months, the painful circle is finally closed for the family, and in the coming days, she will return, together with her two young sons, to eternal rest in the land of Israel,” the statement said.
Earlier Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it received a coffin from Hamas, and transferred a set of human remains to Israeli authorities. Hamas-run Al-Aqsa news reported that the militant group had handed over what it described as Bibas’ body to the Red Cross, citing its leader Mahmoud Mardawi.
A convoy carrying the remains arrived in Tel Aviv for identification on Friday night. As the vehicles arrived at the city’s Abu Kabir Forensics Center, mourners lined the street outside, holding Israeli flags.
Hamas, which says Shiri and the two boys were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2023, said later that her body may have earlier been mixed up with the body of another person killed in the airstrike, and vowed to investigate.
Israel has rejected Hamas’ explanation of how the Bibas family members died. On Friday, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari claimed forensic evidence showed militants had murdered the two boys “with their bare hands.” He did not elaborate on the claim, which Hamas later dismissed as “sheer lies.”",['Lucas Lilieholm'],en

Hamas said it will investigate Israel’s claims, insisting that it intends to abide by the terms of the ceasefire deal reached with Israel.
The Israeli military confirmed on Friday that two of the four bodies handed over were Shiri’s young sons Kfir and Ariel, along with another captive Oded Lifshitz. However, during the identification process, the military determined one of the bodies received was not that of Shiri Bibas, and did not match with other hostages. “This is an anonymous, unidentified body,” the military said in a statement.
“We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all our hostages,” added the military.
The revelation is the latest tragic twist for the Bibas family, who have become among the most recognizable victims of the October 7 terror attacks, with confirmation of their deaths triggering an outpouring of grief in Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday described Hamas’ failure to return Shiri’s body as “an unimaginable cynical move.”
“We will operate determinedly to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages — both the living and the dead — and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and vicious violation,” he said, adding that the body handed over to Israel belonged to a “Gazan woman.”
Hamas said on Friday it affirms its “seriousness and full commitment” to its obligations under the ceasefire agreement with Israel and pledged to examine Israel’s claims.
“We will examine these claims with complete seriousness,” the group said in a statement, adding that it will “announce the results clearly.”
“We have no interest in not committing or keeping any bodies with us,” it said.
The group also reiterated remarks made earlier by the Hamas-controlled Government Media Office in Gaza, which said that Shiri’s mutilated body may have been mixed up with other bodies under rubble in Gaza as a result of an Israeli airstrike.
“We also point out the possibility of an error or overlap in the bodies, which may have resulted from the occupation targeting and bombing the place where the family was with other Palestinians,” Hamas said.
It also called on Israel to return the body of the Palestinian woman Israel claims to have been handed over instead of Shiri.
Hostage releases to continue
At just nine months, Kfir was the youngest hostage kidnapped into Gaza and the youngest to have been killed. His brother, Ariel, was aged four. During Thursday’s macabre handover Hamas handed back four black coffins bearing the photos of Shiri, Ariel, Kfir and Lifshitz, flanked by masked militants in a highly orchestrated and propaganda-filled ceremony.
Despite the development, the Israeli military said plans for the release of a further six Israeli hostages on Saturday were not expected to change.
Hamas said in November 2023 that the Bibas children and their mother had been killed in an airstrike, a claim it repeated Friday without presenting any evidence.
Daniel Hagari, the spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said on Friday that Ariel and Kfir “were brutally murdered during their captivity in Gaza in the first weeks of the war.”
Hagari claimed that “the terrorists didn’t murder them with gunfire – they murdered them with their bare hands. Afterwards, they committed terrible actions in order to try and hide the horrific acts.”
Hagari cited forensic findings and intelligence as backing those claims, but did not provide specific evidence.
Neither did he specify whether Hamas militants – or members of another group – killed the children.
Hamas has vehemently denied Hagari’s claims, which it labelled “sheer lies.”
“This is a desperate attempt to evade the responsibility of (Israel’s) criminal army for the killing of the family, in addition to (its) other crimes that have affected the prisoners in the Gaza Strip,” the group said.
Israel has in the past said that surveillance footage recovered in Khan Younis showed that the Bibas family was at a site belonging to the Mujahideen Brigades, a militant faction allied to Hamas.
Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, called on the UN to condemn “Hamas’ barbarity” and make an “immediate demand for the return of Shiri to her family.”
“There are no words that can describe such an atrocity. Hamas not only murdered Ariel and Kfir Bibas in cold blood – a four-year-old boy and a 10-month-old baby – but continues to violate every basic moral value even after their death,” Danon said.
“Instead of returning Shiri, the mother of Kfir and Ariel, Hamas returned an unidentified body, as if it were a worthless shipment. This is a new low, an evil and cruelty with no parallel.”
The failure to return Shiri’s remains also prompted a senior US official to warn that Hamas must return her body and all the remaining hostages held in Gaza or “face total annihilation.”
Speaking to CNN late Thursday, Adam Boehler, the United States envoy for hostage affairs, said Israel had told him the boys had been murdered a month after they were taken.
“I don’t know what they thought when they put the body of someone else in a coffin and said that it was the mother of two kids that have been brutally murdered,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, as he called on Hamas to release all remaining hostages and return Shiri’s body.
“If I were them, I’d release everybody or they’re going to face total annihilation,” he added.
Fresh agony for father
The children’s father, Yarden Bibas, was also kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel on October 7, 2023. He was released by Hamas earlier this month after 484 days of captivity, one of the 19 Israeli hostages freed alive under the January 2025 ceasefire deal.
The two boys and their mother, who was 32 when she was taken hostage, were not released from Gaza during the temporary truce in late November 2023, even though the deal agreed between Israel and Hamas called for all women and children to be set free. The IDF said at that time they believed the family was being held by other militant groups, not Hamas.
Following his release, Yarden was met by his sister and father in a somber reunion. “Sadly, my family hasn’t returned to me yet. They are still there. My light is still there, and as long as they’re there, everything here is dark,” Yarden said in a statement published shortly after his return.
The announcement that one of the bodies is not Shiri has triggered fresh grief and anger in Israel.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Friday, “we are horrified and devastated” that Shiri was not returned “despite the agreement and our desperate hopes.”
“Israel and the international community must stand firm in ensuring that the agreement is upheld while acting with wisdom and urgency to address these blatant violations. Every step must be taken with careful responsibility to secure the safe return of all hostages,” it added.
A video of the Bibas family’s abduction became one of the symbols of the brutality of the October 7 terror attack. It showed a terrified Shiri clinging tightly to her children wrapped in a blanket, with Ariel still sucking his pacifier. Following their abduction, a photo of Kfir holding a pink elephant toy and looking directly at the camera with a toothless smile has been featured in numerous campaigns and protests around the world.
His brother Ariel, just four at the time of the attack, was often shown in a photo taken after he had a haircut, still wrapped in the hairdresser’s cape. Earlier photos of the family showed Ariel, a big fan of Batman, with locks of long red hair.
The picture was shown on the large screens at New York City’s Times Square, printed on t-shirts worn by protesters in London, Berlin and elsewhere, and brought to the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos by Israeli President Isaac Herzog.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/middleeast/arab-leaders-meeting-gaza-trump-intl-latam/index.html,Arab leaders gather to discuss postwar Gaza proposal to counter Trump’s ‘Riviera’ plan,2025-02-21 05:01:47,"Arab leaders met in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh on Friday for the first time to formulate a response to President Donald Trump’s plan for the US to take ownership of Gaza, expel its Palestinian population and turn it into a Middle Eastern “Riviera.”
The meeting – including Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other Gulf Arab nations – took place ahead of a larger Arab summit on March 4, Saudi Arabia said. A meeting of Islamic countries is expected to follow, according to the Egyptian foreign ministry.
Originally announced by Egypt in early February as an “emergency summit,” the gathering will take place five weeks after Trump first floated his plan, showing the struggle among Arab states to craft a unified stance.
Saudi state television said the meeting was a routine “brotherly informal meeting” without mentioning Gaza, Trump or the Arab plan.
Conflicting details have emerged about the Arab plan.
A report published in Egypt’s state-run Al Ahram Weekly said Cairo was proposing a 10-to-20-year plan to rebuild Gaza with Gulf Arab funding, while excluding Hamas from governing the enclave and allowing its 2.1 million Palestinian residents to remain.
Al Ahram, citing Egyptian sources, said the plan has yet to secure the full support of Arab nations, who disagree on how Gaza should be governed. CNN has asked the Egyptian government for comment.
Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly on Wednesday claimed that his country could fully rebuild Gaza in three years to a state that is “better than it was before,” without saying how he plans to achieve that. If a permanent ceasefire is reached in Gaza in the coming months, that would mean the vision could be completed before the end of Trump’s presidential term.
Most assessments suggest that a complete reconstruction of the enclave would take much longer.
The World Bank, the European Union and the United Nations said in a joint statement Tuesday that, according to their estimates, a return of essential services alone, including health, education, as well as the clearing of rubble, would take three years. The full rebuilding of the devastated enclave would need 10 years and cost more than $50 billion, with housing alone estimated to cost $15 billion. The Egyptian prime minister said that his country’s plan takes those assessments into consideration.
Meanwhile, the Egyptian government and real estate developers in the country have been eyeing a role in the rebuilding process, which could come with contracts worth billions of dollars.
“We have experience, and we have applied it (before) in Egypt,” Madbouly said in a news conference in Egypt’s new administrative capital. “The capability to rebuild the (Gaza) Strip and executing it in way that will make it better than it was before the destruction – truly three years is an acceptable timeline to do this.”
Trump said on Wednesday that he had not yet seen the Egyptian plan.
‘Long and complex journey’
Despite urgency from Arab countries to present Trump with a convincing counterproposal, rebuilding Gaza is a “long and complex” journey, the World Bank, EU and UN said.
It will likely need to address governance and finance with international backing –contentious issues that could be difficult to resolve.
Any reconstruction effort would be futile if a fragile ceasefire in Gaza fails, plunging the territory back to war.
A source familiar with the reconstruction plans said that funding could include public and private donations, likely from the EU and Gulf Arab countries, adding that there could be an international donor conference for Gaza in April.
The plan could also fall through if Israel, which controlled Gaza’s border long before Hamas’ October 2023 attack, refuses to cooperate. So far, it has backed Trump’s plan to de-populate Gaza, and its defense ministry this week announced plans to launch a “Directorate for the Voluntary Departure of Gaza Residents” to facilitate, it says, Gazans who wish to emigrate.
Hamas and Israel reached an agreement last month for the first phase of a truce that could culminate in permanent ceasefire. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said on Tuesday that talks will start on a potential second phase of the truce – two weeks after they were due to begin.
The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority said on Thursday it was prepared to govern Gaza after the war, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected. The PA isn’t expected to participate in the Saudi meeting on Friday.
Hamas has sent conflicting messages on what role it sees for itself in Gaza after the war. Over the weekend, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan sent a defiant message, saying during an interview in Qatar that the group would decide for itself who will govern Gaza. But this week, Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson, said the group is not “clinging to power.”
Egypt’s state-backed Al Qahera News reported Saturday that Egypt is working to form a temporary committee to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza.
Meanwhile, Qatar said that Palestinians should decide who governs them in the future.
The UAE is one of the few Arab nations that has expressed willingness to consider a role in postwar Gaza at the invitation of a reformed Palestinian Authority and with a commitment from Israel for a future Palestinian state. It has rejected Trump’s plan to displace Palestinians.
But Hamas has warned that it will treat anyone that takes Israel’s place in Gaza as it treats Israel, calling on regional states not to become “agents” for Israel.",['Mostafa Salem'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/asia/thailand-hostage-gaza-israel-celebration-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,Freed Thai hostages return home to celebrations and spiritual blessings after 15 months in Gaza,2025-02-21 11:00:47,"In the crowded room, a local spiritual leader chanted verses in the Isan dialect of northeast Thailand while attendees knelt on woven mats.
Between their clasped hands ran a single white string as they performed a ceremony to welcome and protect the man who sat among them: Surasak Rumnao, who had been held hostage in Gaza for more than a year.
Dressed in a white shirt with closely cropped hair, Surasak sat beside his friend Pongsak Thaenna, who was also abducted near the Gaza border during Hamas’ deadly attack on October 7, 2023.
The two men had kept each other going throughout their 15 months in captivity; now, they smiled as family and friends took turns tying sacred white threads around their wrists to bestow blessings and ward off evil.
“I feel life is much more valuable now,” Surasak told CNN two weeks after his release, speaking at home in the northeastern Thai town of Ban Dung close to the Laos border. “(I’m) just trying to live as long as possible.”
Of the 251 people taken hostage by Hamas militants on October 7, many were migrant workers from poor rural parts of Asia, who had gone to work in Israel’s agricultural, construction and health care sectors to send money back home. Among them were Surasak and Pongsak – two of the five Thai workers freed in January under a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel.
Like both men, many of the Thai abductees and victims were from Udon Thani, one of the country’s poorest provinces where jobs are hard to come by – pushing young people to overseas destinations or large cities like Bangkok for work.
At Surasak’s return party, the room was filled with elderly community members; most of their working-age children had left the small town.
After the ceremony, partygoers dug into a home-cooked feast of beef soup, fermented fish, sticky rice and minced meats, before celebrating late into the night with Thai liquors. But concerns also lingered for the remaining hostages in Gaza, including one Thai national.
“I want those who have been captured to be released quickly. We are trying to pray that they will be released, not just the Israelis but also the remaining Thai,” Surasak said.
“Having been in that situation, we understand the feeling of waiting for someone to come and help us.”
15 months in captivity
Like so many men and women from Thailand’s rural Isan region, Surasak, now 32, has been working away from home since he was a teenager – job-hunting in Bangkok after high school, then doing a stint at a factory in Taiwan.
Before the abduction, he had spent five years growing tomatoes, eggplants, figs and apples on Israeli farms.
The pay was much better than what he could earn back home, he said – to the point where he could fund his siblings’ education, give his mother money for daily spending, and support the family’s rice farm.
The impact of foreign wages is clear in Surasak’s village of Ban Dung, where new houses have popped up on dirt roads and cracked asphalt streets. His home, painted an eye-catching blue and turquoise, is one of the brightest, and has been expanded and renovated several times over the years.
But that steady flow of income and improvement came to a shuddering halt on October 7 as Hamas militants poured across the Gaza border and began their murder and kidnap spree across southern Israel.
After hearing word of the attacks, Surasak was trying to rush back to his employer’s farm when he was abducted. He and the other captured workers were tied up, put in the back of a pickup truck and told not to look around as the vehicle drove off.
The hostages were split up after they reached Gaza but Surasak and Pongsak stayed together, sleeping and eating side-by-side throughout the 15 months in captivity. Surasak said they weren’t mistreated, and were fed pita bread and cheese, with a portion of meat once a week.
Back in Ban Dung, his mother, Kammee, was anxiously contacting various Thai government agencies, who eventually confirmed that her son was one of the hostages and was still alive.
“I was afraid that he might lose weight, not eat well, or have trouble sleeping,” she told CNN. “I was scared about my child being taken away and worried about what might happen to him.”
At first, Surasak would ask his captors when he would be released – and they would assure him, “Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, in three days, next month,” he said. “After asking frequently, I stopped asking because I didn’t want to have expectations from them anymore.”
Instead, he tried to “have conversations and show them my sincerity, that I am not a soldier and have no involvement with them,” he said. He joked with his captors, even playing cards with them, using hand-drawn decks when no others were available, and sketching games of checkers.
Throughout it all, he kept track of the days by looking at the date on the guards’ wristwatches – though he had no other news about what was happening on the outside.
He and Pongsak would “encourage each other by saying that they wouldn’t do anything to us. They would release us eventually as negotiations were underway,” he said. “We trusted both the Israeli side and our Thai side, along with all the agencies that were doing their best to help us. We had to have faith in them.”
When the Hamas guards finally told Surasak in January that he would be released, he didn’t believe them, he said.
But before he knew it, they were in a car, then on a plane – then reuniting with tearful families at Bangkok airport in front of journalists and Thai officials.
Joyous return
Surasak’s return home was met with joy and relief, with the ceremony on Saturday meant to “call back” his spirit – a common practice after somebody has endured a hardship.
The community believes the loss of a person’s spirit or life force from their body can cause poor health or wellbeing – so on Saturday they offered gifts to entice the spirit back and restore Surasak’s happiness.
“Come back, good spirit,” the attendees chanted together. “Come back already!”
His mother said she had waited a long time for that day.
“I’m so happy and proud that my child has returned to be in our embrace once again,” she said. “My child is like the pillar of the family, and I wouldn’t just let that go. Seeing my child come back gives me so much hope, and I’m truly delighted.”
As he adjusts to being back home, Surasak says he has no plans to return to Israel. His family also wants him to stay in Thailand.
“I think I have enough. I will use the knowledge I’ve gained to improve life in our own hometown,” he said. “I want to live a life farming and cultivating the land of my ancestors.”
But his thoughts aren’t far from the remaining hostages in Gaza, and whether the ceasefire deal will hold long enough to get them all out.
In the last round, the deal looked on shaky ground after Hamas accused Israel of violating its commitments and said it would postpone the hostage releases – though it eventually went ahead after talks with mediators in Egypt and Qatar. Six Israeli hostages are scheduled to be released next on February 22; it’s not clear when the remaining Thai hostage will be freed.
“I hope that those who are still inside remain strong. They will eventually be able to get out,” Surasak said. “Sometimes the exchanges take time… We just have to wait.”","['Kocha Olarn', 'Jessie Yeung']",en

No casualties were reported and there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts, which occurred when explosive devices planted on the empty vehicles detonated in quick succession in the cities of Bat Yam and Holon, south of Israel’s financial center.
In Bat Yam, two bombs exploded on buses parked in a depot, authorities said. A third blast was reported in Holon from an explosive device planted on a third bus.
Photos from Bat Yam showed two burned out buses in the depot and forensics personnel working at the scene.
Meanwhile, an explosive device that did not detonate was discovered on a fourth bus, police said.
Israel stepped up security and halted bus and train operations across the country following the blasts, which a statement from Netanyahu’s office called an “attempt to perpetrate a chain of mass bus bombings.”
After meeting with the defense minister, the head of the Israel Defense Forces and top security and police officials, Netanyahu “ordered the IDF to carry out an intensive operation against centers of terrorism,” in the West Bank, according to the statement.
“The Prime Minister also ordered the Israel Police and the (Israel Security Agency) to increase preventative activity against additional attacks in Israeli cities,” it added.
The bus blasts came just hours after Palestinian militant group Hamas returned four bodies purported to be hostages held in Gaza since its October 7, 2023 attack.
The bodies were handed over as part of a ceasefire deal enacted last month that has appeared shaky in recent weeks as Israel and Hamas accused each other of violations.
Israel on Thursday accused Hamas of violating the deal by returning remains in one casket that were found not to match with any hostage.
West Bank reinforcements
Following the bus blasts, the Israeli military said it would deploy three additional battalions to the West Bank on Friday morning.
“The IDF continues to conduct ongoing situational assessment and is prepared to expand offensive activity,” it said in a statement.
Since Hamas’ October 7 attack, Israel has engaged in an increasingly militarized campaign that it says targets West Bank militants, employing tactics like airstrikes that were once nearly unheard of there.
The Israel Defense Forces launched a major campaign - “Operation Iron Wall” - focused on the northern West Bank last month, just two days after the Gaza ceasefire began, saying it was aimed at eliminating “terrorists and terror infrastructure” and at “ensuring terrorism does not return” following its completion.
The operation has displaced at least 40,000 Palestinians in the northern West Bank from their homes, according to the UN.
UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, warned last week that the forced displacement of Palestinian communities in the northern West Bank had been escalating at an “alarming pace.”
The agency said the West Bank had suffered 38 airstrikes this year alone, with advanced weaponry and controlled detonations becoming more commonplace, marking a “spillover of the war in Gaza.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages-release-bibas-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hamas stages macabre ceremony to release bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include Bibas children and their mother",2025-02-20 07:39:32,"Hamas on Thursday put on a macabre handover ceremony in central Gaza to return the bodies of four Israeli hostages taken on October 7, 2023.
It was the first time the militant group has released the remains of dead hostages since its attack on Israel, and marked a somber turn for a country more used to elation when former captives returned home alive.
Among those released were said to be the bodies of Shiri Bibas, who was aged 32 when she and her sons Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months, were abducted from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, southern Israel by Hamas-led militants more than 16 months ago. The two boys have become the most recognizable victims of the October 7 terror attacks.
The fourth body was that of Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 years old when he and his wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Yocheved was released by Hamas on October 24, 2023.
At a press conference Thursday, the Head of Israel’s National Center of Forensic Medicine Dr. Chen Kugel said experts had confirmed that one of the bodies was Lifshitz, but did not comment on the other three bodies.
“We share in the deep sorrow of the Lifshitz family. Today, 503 days after the October 7 massacre, we have determined that Oded Lifshitz was murdered in captivity over a year ago,” Kugel said. Earlier Thursday, the Prime Minister’s Office said that Lifshitz had been “murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization.”
Israeli officials did not provide details on how they knew Lifshitz was murdered in captivity.
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement denied the Israeli claims, saying Lifshitz was killed in an Israeli strike along with “the security team assigned to protect and serve him.” It provided no details or evidence to support its claim.
As in past weeks, Hamas used the handover ceremony as an opportunity for anti-Israel propaganda. But the juxtaposition of four black coffins borne by masked militants rather than living hostages led to widespread condemnation in Israel, whose television networks – unlike in past weeks – did not carry the ceremony live. Loud music blared as Red Cross workers loaded coffins into armored SUVs.
Hamas claimed in November 2023 that Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas were killed in an Israeli airstrike, though never presented any evidence, and Israel never confirmed their deaths. Among the propaganda posters strung up by Hamas on Thursday was an image of a vampiric Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looming over an image of the hostages.
“503 agonizing days of uncertainty have come to an end,” the Lifshitz family said in a statement, after receiving confirmation that Oded’s body had been returned. “Now we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who has been missing from us since October 7. Our family’s healing process will begin now and will not end until the last hostage is returned.”
The caskets were first handed to the Red Cross then transferred to the Israeli military, whose soldiers draped the coffins in Israeli flags and brought them into Israel. Scores of people, many waving flags, lined the roads as a convoy carrying the four coffins traveled to Tel Aviv.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said hearts across the country “lie in tatters,” and asked for forgiveness on behalf of the government for failing to protect those captured on October 7.
“Agony. Pain. There are no words,” he wrote in a post on X.
Hamas claimed in November 2023 that the Bibas children and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike, but did not produce any evidence. Israel has never confirmed their deaths.
The children’s father, Yarden Bibas, was released by Hamas earlier this month after 484 days of captivity. He was one of the 19 Israeli hostages freed alive under the January 2025 ceasefire deal.
The Israeli military had previously retrieved the bodies of multiple hostages in Gaza.
Symbols of October 7 horror
At just 9 months old, Kfir was the youngest hostage kidnapped into Gaza and the youngest to have been killed. A photo of him holding a pink elephant toy and looking directly at the camera with a toothless smile has been featured in numerous campaigns and protests around the world.
His brother Ariel, just 4 at the time of the attack, was often shown in a photo taken after he had a haircut, still wrapped in the hairdresser’s cape. Earlier photos of the family showed Ariel, a big fan of Batman, with locks of long red hair.
The picture was shown on the large screens at New York City’s Times Square, printed on t-shirts worn by protesters in London, Berlin and elsewhere, and brought to the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos by Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
A video of the Bibas family’s abduction became one of the symbols of the brutality of the October 7 terror attack. It showed a terrified Shiri clinging tightly to her children wrapped in a blanket, with Ariel still sucking his pacifier.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later released another video, which they said showed Shiri and the two boys alive in southern Gaza on October 7. The footage showed a person wrapped in a blanket carrying a child being ordered around by armed militants before being put in a car and driven away.
The two boys and their mother were not released from Gaza during the temporary truce in late November 2023, even though the deal agreed between Israel and Hamas called for all women and children to be set free.
The IDF said at that time they believed the family was being held by other militant groups, not Hamas.
Later that week, Hamas said the two Bibas children and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike, without providing evidence. Israel never confirmed their deaths.
A few days after making the claim, Hamas released a video of Yarden, the father, in which he blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the death of his wife and two children.
Yarden appeared to be in extreme distress in the video and was very likely speaking under duress.
In a statement published shortly after his release this month, Yarden urged the world to “continue doing everything possible” to ensure all hostages return home.
“Sadly, my family hasn’t returned to me yet. They are still there. My light is still there, and as long as they’re there, everything here is dark. Thanks to you, I was brought back - help me bring the light back to my life,” he said, referring to the Israeli public.
The run up to the release of the four bodies on Thursday was marred by the Bibas family’s anger at the Israeli Prime Minister’s office, which they said had released the names without their approval.
A source in the Prime Minister’s office told CNN that while it had not published an official statement with the names of the dead hostages, IDF liaison officers had approved the publishing of the names to reporters without clearing this first with the family.
The forum later released a statement at the request of the Bibas family asking the public not to “eulogize our loved ones until there is a confirmation after final identification.”

The body of Oded Lifshitz is also expected to be released on the same day, in what will be the first handover of dead hostages since the ceasefire deal with Hamas went into effect in January.
“This news cuts like a knife through our hearts, the families’ hearts and the hearts of people all over the world,” the forum said in a statement. “It is with great sadness that we received the news of the return of Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas, along with Oded Lifshitz, who were kidnapped alive and will return deceased for eternal rest in Israel.”
For Israel, the first return of hostage bodies will a hugely emotional and somber moment.
The two Bibas boys have become the most recognizable victims of the October 7 terror attacks on Israel. At just nine months, Kfir was the youngest hostage kidnapped into Gaza and the youngest to have been killed. A photo of him holding a pink elephant toy and looking directly at the camera with a toothless smile has been featured in numerous campaigns and protests around the world.
His brother Ariel, just four at the time of the attack, was often shown in a photo taken after he had a haircut, still wrapped in the hairdresser’s cape. Earlier photos of the family showed Ariel, a big fan of Batman, with locks of long red hair.
Their mother Shiri was kidnapped age 32. Their father Yarden was among those released from earlier this month after 484 days in captivity.
The announcement of the names was marred by the Bibas family’s anger at the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, which they said had released the names without their approval.
The forum later released a statement at the request of the Bibas family asking the public not to “eulogize our loved ones until there is a confirmation after final identification.”
A source in the Prime Minister’s office told CNN that while it had not published an official statement with the names of the dead hostages, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) liaison officers had approved the publishing of the names to reporters without clearing this first with the family.
“This is a serious mistake in the conduct of the IDF liaison officers towards the Bibas family, which resulted from an unfortunate human error,” the source said.
The IDF told CNN it had reviewed the matter and spoken with the families. “We regret the unintentional mistake and the distress it caused the families,” it said.
Ahead of tomorrow’s releases, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that “my own heart is torn,” in a video address posted online Wednesday evening.
“Tomorrow will be a very difficult day for the state of Israel. A wrenching day, a day of grief. We are bringing home four of our beloved hostages, deceased,” he said.
Netanyahu added: “We are grieving, we are in pain, but we are also determined to ensure that such a thing never happens again.”
Lifshitz was 83 years old when he and his wife Yocheved were kidnapped from their home in kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, 2023. Yocheved was one of two hostages released by Hamas later that month, while Oded remained in captivity.
The forum said in a statement Wednesday that “along with the heavy sorrow, their return for burial creates certainty for their loved ones and closes the agonizing circle of uncertainty that has lasted for 502 days.”
“There are another 69 abductees being held captive by Hamas, for whom there is still no release date,” the forum said, adding that decision-makers should “expedite” the negotiations.
Lifshitz’s family said in a statement that “these are not easy times for us, after we were informed that our beloved Oded is on the list of the hostages who will return to Israel tomorrow, after being kidnapped alive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz.”
“For 502 days we hoped and prayed for a different ending, but until we receive absolute certainty, our journey will not end, and even after that we will continue to fight until the last hostage is returned,” the statement added.

Since Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack, Israel has engaged in an increasingly militarized campaign that it says targets West Bank militants, employing tactics like airstrikes that were once nearly unheard of there.
The Israel Defense Forces launched a major campaign - “Operation Iron Wall” - focused on the northern West Bank last month.
That operation, Israel’s defense minister said last month, was explicitly applying the lessons of Israel’s “repeated raids in Gaza.” Israel’s war in Gaza has destroyed around 90% of housing units, according to the United Nations.
The West Bank operation has displaced at least 40,000 Palestinians in the northern West Bank from their homes, according to the United Nations.
Abdullah Kamil, the governor of Tulkarem in the West Bank, told CNN Wednesday that the demolitions carried out Tuesday destroyed buildings that had housed dozens of families over several floors.
“The Israeli military are doing this under pretext of security and fighting terrorism,” he said. It is a “purely political” operation, he alleged, to satisfy hardliners in the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In November, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich – who is in charge of Jewish settlements in the West Bank – ordered preparations for the annexation of the settlements, saying that US President Donald Trump’s victory “brings an important opportunity for the state of Israel.”
Palestinians want the West Bank, as well as Gaza and occupied East Jerusalem, for a future independent state. Jewish settlements there are considered illegal under international law.
Israel launched Operation Iron Wall two days after the Gaza ceasefire began, saying it was aimed at eliminating “terrorists and terror infrastructure” and at “ensuring terrorism does not return” following its completion. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that its soldiers were operating in Tulkarem to “neutralize terrorist infrastructure.” It said that its clearing operations would enable “freedom of movement within the camp area, thereby enhancing operational flexibility for forces to effectively thwart terrorism in the region.”
Videos on a Palestinian television channel showed bulldozers demolishing homes in what the outlet said was Tulkarem refugee camp. Other videos seen by CNN from a local journalist showed the scene from another angle with a bulldozer in the tight streets of the refugee camp and soldiers walking in its alleys.
The Israeli military also said Tuesday it had arrested 25 people in the northern West Bank it says were suspected of “involvement in terrorist activity across the area.”
“During the activity, the troops collected findings and weapons used by the enemy,” the military added.
‘Spillover’ of Gaza war
Israel’s military operation in the West Bank that started in the Jenin refugee camp last month has since expanded to the Tulkarem, Nur Shams, and El Far’a refugee camps, according to UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
Kamil, the Tulkarem governor, told CNN that 85% of the residents of the Nur Shams and Tulkarem camps had been displaced – approximately 16,000 people altogether.
He alleged that Israeli forces had raided houses in the middle of the night. Many properties in the Nur Shams camp had been extensively damaged, he said, and water and electricity in both camps had been cut off.
UNRWA warned that the forced displacement of Palestinian communities in the northern West Bank had been escalating at an “alarming pace.”
The agency said the West Bank had suffered 38 airstrikes this year alone, with advanced weaponry and controlled detonations becoming more commonplace, marking a “spillover of the war in Gaza.”
Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on Tuesday directed urgent humanitarian aid and shelter for “Palestinian people forcibly displaced” by Israeli forces in the “northern West Bank, particularly in the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nur Shams” until “Israeli forces withdraw from the targeted areas.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/middleeast/israel-ceasefire-negotiation-analysis-intl-latam/index.html,Gaza ceasefire’s future uncertain as Netanyahu sidelines security chiefs in negotiations,2025-02-18 20:16:12,"In a move that brings the fate of the Gaza ceasefire even closer under his personal control, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is appointing a close political ally to lead talks over phase two of the current ceasefire in Gaza, replacing Israel’s previous chief negotiator.
“In the coming days, Israel will enter negotiations on Phase B, which is a political phase that deals with the question of the conditions for ending the war,” an Israeli source told CNN. “Accordingly, the Israeli efforts will be led by the Secretary of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, and he will do so in front of the US President’s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.”
Dermer replaces David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, who led talks in January that resulted in the current deal. The Israeli government has not confirmed whether Barnea will stay on as part of the Israeli negotiating team.
Talks on phase two of a ceasefire, which would see the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza and the release of all living hostages, were supposed to have begun more than two weeks ago. Even as Netanyahu says that the talks will now begin, it is unclear how committed the prime minister is to seeing them succeed. His finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has promised to withdraw from the government coalition if Israel does not return to war in Gaza when the current ceasefire expires on March 1.
The reshuffle in Israel’s negotiating approach comes as Hamas said that it would release the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest Israelis held by the group, Kfir and Ariel Bibas. The militant group is expected to release six living hostages on Saturday, and a further four bodies next week – all in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Removing Barnea sidelines Israel’s security establishment, with whom Netanyahu has frequently clashed.
Ronen Bar, the head of the Israel Security Agency (also known as the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency), will not be part of the new negotiating team, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Netanyahu’s allies have called on the prime minister to fire Bar, after it was reported last weekend that the Shin Bet is investigating members of prime minister’s office for inappropriately lobbying on behalf of Qatari state interests – something his office has denied.
A second Israeli source told CNN the government wants to push Hamas “for more hostages now and extending phase one,” saying “at the moment the goal is to get as many live hostages,” given the emaciated state of three hostages released earlier this month.
On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said that phase two could be delayed if they believe there is “a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement.” He also said that if Israel believes that “negotiations are not leading anywhere,” the military would resume the war in Gaza.
Hamas negotiators in Cairo have appeared to accelerate delivery of their side of the 42-day phase one agreement, laying out a timeline for the return of the last remaining 14 hostages of the 33 agreed to be released in phase one – all to be completed by next week.
It was a shift by the terror group, which only last week threatened to derail talks completely, saying they would no longer hand over hostages and alleging Israel had failed to meet terms of the agreement, including by allowing prefabricated housing and heavy machinery to enter Gaza.
Netanyahu’s office on Tuesday said that it had “approved bringing only a small amount of caravans and heavy equipment into Gaza,” saying that it would “not in any way change the feasibility of implementing the Trump plan for voluntary immigration and creating another Gaza – to which Prime Minister Netanyahu is fully committed.”
US President Donald Trump has proposed that the United States “own” Gaza, and that 2.1 million Palestinians living there move to “beautiful sites” in Middle Eastern countries. The proposal has been welcomed by Netanyahu, but derided by Palestinian and Arab leaders alike, who characterize it as ethnic cleansing.
It is unclear what changed Hamas’s calculus to recommit to the hostages’ release in the coming days. US President Donald Trump had threatened that “all hell is going to break out” for Hamas unless they release all hostages by this past Saturday – a deadline that came and went without incident.
Trump’s envoy Witkoff outlined the challenges facing Netanyahu. “It just is a little bit more intricate and complicated in terms of how we bring the two sides together on this, because phase two contemplates an end of the war, but it also contemplates Hamas not being involved in the government and being gone from Gaza. So we’ve got to we’ve got to square those two things,” he told Fox News on Sunday.","['Mick Krever', 'Eugenia Yosef', 'Nic Robertson']",en

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will, for the time being, remain at the outposts in Lebanon “so we can continue to defend our residents and to make sure there’s no immediate threat,” Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an IDF spokesperson, said on Monday. Israel’s military identified the handful of strategic locations in southern Lebanon overlooking northern Israeli communities.
The Israeli military is believed to have withdrawn from Lebanese population centers in recent days. The Lebanese military announced new deployments Tuesday morning to various towns in southern Lebanon.
Lebanon will consider any remaining Israeli presence on its territory as an “occupation,” the Lebanese Presidency said in a statement Tuesday, adding that it reserves the right “to employ all means” to ensure Israel’s withdrawal.
But signaling that Hezbollah is unlikely to launch an immediate fight against Israel’s remaining troops, the group’s Al Manar TV declared on Tuesday that southern Lebanon had “returned because of the blood of the martyrs.”
Israel and Hezbollah ended a year-long war in November, in a ceasefire brokered in part by the United States. A deadline for Israel to withdraw, originally set for January, was extended to February 18 at Israel’s request.
Around 60,000 Israelis were forced from their homes in the north of the country after Hezbollah attacked Israel in solidarity with Hamas, in October 2023. Few of them have returned to border towns that have been devastated by rocket fire. A year-long, low-level conflict culminated last fall with an Israeli invasion and bombing campaign that saw more than a million Lebanese civilians displaced from their homes.
“The most basic violation is the presence of Hezbollah activists south of the Litani River,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Tuesday. “Unfortunately, it continued to be the reality. Once Lebanon fully implements its side of the deal, there will be no need to hold these points.”
Israel has declined to say whether Lebanon’s government had agreed to the extension, saying only that the Israeli government had spoken with the ceasefire’s mediators, led by the US.
Publicly, Lebanese leaders had been scathing. Nabih Berri, the speaker of Lebanon’s parliament, said in a Thursday statement that the US had informed him of Israel’s plan, which he rejected on Lebanon’s behalf.
“I refused to talk about any deadline to extend the withdrawal period,” he said, according to Lebanon’s official news agency NNA. “And it is the responsibility of the Americans to impose the withdrawal.” He added that if Israel remains in those locations, it “means that the Israelis will practice freedom of movement and aggression in Lebanon, and this is unacceptable.”
Israel has accused the Lebanese government of failing to uphold its side of the ceasefire agreement, by failing to adequately deploy south of the Litani River – an area from which both Israel and Hezbollah are supposed to withdraw.
The IDF has, on occasion, continued to bomb Hezbollah targets during the ceasefire, accusing the Iran-backed militant group of using military sites in violation of the November agreement. It has also continued, on a near-daily basis, to destroy buildings in southern Lebanon in an effort, the military says, to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure. The efforts have left many of southern Lebanon’s towns in ruins.
The US military, which along with the United Nations and France runs a body to administer the ceasefire and discuss disputes, has been vague – stopping short of confirming that Israel would uphold its withdrawal commitment. In a statement on Friday, Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers said that the Lebanese Armed Forces “will control all population centers in the Southern Litani Area before next Tuesday.”
Jeffers has in recent weeks praised the Lebanese military, saying that their “checkpoints and patrols operate effectively,” and that it was providing for stability and security.
An official from the US military’s Central Command declined to comment and referred CNN to the State Department.
Naim Qassem, who assumed the post of Hezbollah secretary-general after Israel assassinated his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, in a massive bomb attack last September, said that there were “no excuses” for Israel’s failure to withdraw.
“This is the agreement,” he said in an address on Sunday. “The Lebanese state must take a firm stance and say no – because if Israel remains in any occupied area after that date, it will be in violation of the agreement.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Thursday that his country put together a proposal for United Nations peacekeepers to replace Israeli forces at key points in Lebanon, Reuters reported. This was meant to ensure that Israeli troops leave Lebanon by the February 18 deadline.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/middleeast/israel-hostage-remains-intl-latam/index.html,Israel prepares to receive the remains of several hostages,2025-02-17 19:31:45,"Israel is preparing to receive the remains of an unknown number of hostages from Gaza on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
The identities of the hostages have not been released.
This marks the first handover of deceased hostages since the ceasefire deal with Hamas went into effect in January. The Israeli military had previously retrieved the bodies of multiple hostages in Gaza.
In the latest round, three Israeli hostages were released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday. Hamas had initially said it would postpone the releases and accused Israel of violating its commitments to the ceasefire agreement. Amid the dispute, US President Donald Trump urged Israel to cancel its deal with Hamas and “let all hell break out.”
Hamas later said it would go ahead with the releases following talks with Egypt and Qatar who had been mediating ceasefire talks and said they would work to “remove obstacles and fill gaps.”
Hamas has now released a total of 19 Israeli hostages out of a total of 33 that are due to be released in staggered intervals as part of a first phase of the ceasefire agreement. The Israeli government says eight out of the 33 are dead.
According to the terms of the initial ceasefire and hostage release agreement, the next exchange is scheduled for February 22, when three hostages are set to be released.
The Israeli government also faces intensifying pressure from the public to secure the release of the remaining hostages. Large crowds of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on Monday to mark 500 days since the October 7 attack and call for the release of all hostages.
However, negotiations on the second phase of the agreement, which were due to start two weeks ago, and on extending the ceasefire which expires on March 1, are in doubt.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would hold a political-security cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the second phase of the deal. The meeting came as an Israeli delegation headed to Cairo for talks, but only to discuss the first phase of the agreement. Netanyahu’s office said the delegation would “receive instructions for the continuation of negotiations on Phase B matters” after the political-security cabinet meeting wraps on Monday. No news of the outcomes of that meeting have yet to be published.
Netanyahu, reacting to speculation about the future plan for Gaza, on Monday reiterated his position that “on the day after the war in Gaza, there will be no Hamas and no Palestinian Authority,” adding that he was “committed to President (Donald) Trump’s plan to create a different Gaza.”
The warning comes as Arab countries scramble to prepare a postwar proposal for Gaza as an alternative to Trump’s plan to “take over” the enclave, depopulate it and turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” The United Arab Emirates has said that it is willing to consider a role in postwar Gaza at the invitation of a reformed Palestinian Authority.
Trump’s remarks and plans for Gaza have sparked widespread international opposition but been welcomed by some ministers in Israel. On Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz “decided that a Directorate for the Voluntary Departure of Gaza Residents will be established in the Defense Ministry,” according to a statement from his ministry.
“The plan includes extensive assistance that will allow any Gaza resident who wishes to voluntarily emigrate to a third country to receive an envelope that includes, among other things, special departure arrangements by sea, air, and land,” the statement added.","['Lauren Izso', 'Irene Nasser']",en

“Whoever comes to fill Israel’s place (in Gaza) will be treated like Israel,” Osama Hamdan, a Hamas spokesperson and political bureau member, said on Saturday during a panel discussion at the Al Jazeera Forum in the Qatari capital Doha.
“Whoever wants to work as an agent for Israel will bear the consequences of being Israel’s agent,” he told the forum.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reacting to speculation about the plan for Gaza, on Monday reiterated his position that “on the day after the war in Gaza, there will be no Hamas and no Palestinian Authority,” adding that he was “committed to President (Donald) Trump’s plan to create a different Gaza.”
The warning comes as Arab countries scramble to prepare a postwar proposal for Gaza as an alternative to US President Trump’s plan to “take over” the strip, depopulate it and turn it into a Middle Eastern “riviera.” The United Arab Emirates has said that it is willing to consider a role in postwar Gaza at the invitation of a reformed Palestinian Authority.
Hamdan also said the idea of Hamas disarming is not up for discussion. The group “was not erased” by the war, he said, adding that it will regroup and continue “and I am telling you, we have an opportunity to expand.”
While many Hamas fighters have been killed by Israel in Gaza, a peer-reviewed study by researchers from a leading health research university found that 59% of the enclave’s population who died due to violence between October 7, 2023 and June 30, 2024 were women, children, and the elderly.
Hamdan’s statement appeared to contradict a claim by another Hamas spokesperson, Hazem Qassem, that the group is not “clinging to power” and does not have to be part of arrangements “in the next phase.”
“Hamas has shown a lot of flexibility on this matter. And we say clearly that it is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political or administrative arrangements in the next phase, particularly with regards to the Gaza Strip if that is in the interest of our Palestinian people,” Qassem told Al Arabiya news channel on Sunday. “Hamas is not clinging to power” and it prioritizes relief and reconstruction for Gazans, he added.
‘Resumption of total war’
Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who used to speak to Hamas through backchannels, described Hamdan’s defiant statement as “a significant development” that has worrying implications.
“It’s official – Hamas wants war and pre-emptively rebukes Egypt and Arab proposals for Gaza,” Baskin said on X.
“This is very bad and it’s the fault of Netanyahu and the Americans mainly for not working in creating an alternative legitimate Palestinian government for Gaza in a post Hamas scenario,” Baskin said on X, adding that Hamdan’s speech “tells you everything you need to know about the terror group and why the resumption of total war in Gaza is merely a matter of time.”
Muhammad Shehada, a visiting fellow with European Council on Foreign Relations’ Middle East and North Africa Programme, said Hamas sees any discussion about dissolving the group as “a red line,” given that it is keen not to allow demilitarization to become a pre-requisite to a peace process.
For Hamas, maintaining an armed presence in Gaza is meant “to act as a deterrent to Israel staying in Gaza permanently or doing what it does in the West Bank,” Shehada said. “It is not a position toward war.”
Israel occupies the West Bank but allows the Palestinian Authority nominal self-rule as part of a peace process in the 1990s that saw Palestinian factions end armed conflict with Israel with the promise of a future Palestinian state that remains unfulfilled. Netanyahu now rejects prospects of Palestinian independence.
In April, Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, told CNN the group’s military wing would give up armed resistance against Israel and integrate into a national army if an independent Palestinian state was established.
Hamdan added that the region should retain the ability to “to slap Israel whenever it wants… as we proved on October 7,” when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel in 2023, killing 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages.
The Hamas official’s comments come as Egyptian state-linked media reported that Cairo is working on a post-war Gaza framework that potentially excludes Hamas. Al Qahera News reported Saturday that Egypt is exerting intense efforts to form a temporary committee that oversees the rebuilding of Gaza. Citing an Egyptian source, the news outlet said that Hamas has confirmed it will not take part in Gaza’s governance after the war.
Egypt is a key mediator in the ceasefire talks, along with Qatar and the United States. Cairo helped mediate the current truce, which saw a halt to Israeli bombing and the release of hostages kidnapped by Hamas. It also saw the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israel.",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

Netanyahu was speaking alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is visiting Israel in his first official trip to the region since assuming the role.
“Over the last 16 months, Israel has dealt a mighty blow to Iran’s terror axis. Under the strong leadership of President Trump… I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job,” Netanyahu said.
Rubio said that there “could never be a nuclear Iran.”
“It’s important to constantly point that whether we talk about Hamas or we talk about Hezbollah, we talk about violence in the West Bank, or we talk about destabilization in Syria, or we talk about any of these issues the militias in Iraq, they all have behind them one common theme – Iran,” Rubio added.
“That must be addressed,” he added.
US intelligence agencies recently warned both the Biden and Trump administrations that Israel will likely attempt to strike facilities key to Iran’s nuclear program this year, according to sources familiar with the assessments.
Israel’s willingness to use military force runs counter to President Donald Trump’s current desire for a peace deal with Tehran, and the recent US intelligence cautions that major strikes on Iranian nuclear sites could increase the risk of a wider war breaking out in the Middle East.
Overall, Israel is also still pursuing the broader goal of causing regime change in Iran, one of the recent US intelligence reports says.
The Israeli leader said he has a common strategy with Trump on Gaza and its future, vowing to open the “gates of hell” if all hostages are not released.
Trump this month proposed the US “take over” Gaza and displace Palestinians out of the devastated strip permanently, triggering a storm of protest.
“It may have shocked and surprised many,” Rubio said in reference to the plan, “but what cannot continue is the same cycle where we repeat over and over again and wind up in the exact same place.”
Netanyahu said on Sunday he knew about the plan before the US president announced it.
“This didn’t come as a surprise, we knew about it and discussed it beforehand,” the Israeli prime minister said.
Speaking to leaders of American Jewish organizations, Netanyahu said the plan was “the only viable plan to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for Israel, and for the region.”
Heavy bombs shipment
Rubio’s trip coincided with the US sending a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel. The munitions were sent after Trump’s administration last month lifted a hold on the deliveries, Israel’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday.
Israel’s defense minister Israel Katz said the shipment of MK-84 munitions “represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States,” in a statement from his ministry. Katz thanked Trump and the US administration for their “unwavering support.”
The new administration’s release of the heavy bomb shipments rolled back one of the few Biden-era policies meant to exert leverage on Israel during its war in Gaza. Former President Joe Biden had restricted the delivery of the 2,000-pound bombs out of concern they could be used indiscriminately by Israel’s military in densely populated areas of Gaza.
Despite causing tensions between Biden and Netanyahu, the move did not portend any major changes in the war. Nor did it significantly improve Biden’s standing among critics of the war, who argued for significantly tighter restrictions on American arms sales to Israel.
The head of Gaza’s Government Media Office Salama Maroof criticized the US decision to send the heavy bombs. “Instead of sending food, medicine, water, or shelter and building materials to the victims in the Gaza Strip, even with a humanitarian motive, the United States of America, the first democracy in the world and a pioneer of human rights, as it describes itself, supports the criminal occupation army with 1,800 heavy MK bombs,” Maroof said.
Rubio landed in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, where he was greeted by Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on the first leg of his trip to the region. He met with Netanyahu at his office in Jerusalem Sunday morning.
It comes a day after three Israeli hostages were released by Hamas and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released by Israel as part of a US-mediated ceasefire agreement, although the fragile nature of the truce was underlined again Sunday when Hamas said an Israeli strike killed three police officers in Gaza, in what it called a “serious violation.”
Monday also marked 500 days in captivity for those hostages seized on October 7. Family members and supporters held a small protest outside the US embassy’s branch office in Tel Aviv on Monday morning calling Trump to keep pushing for the return of all hostages.
And amid uncertainty about the future of the deal, Netanyahu’s office said he would discuss its second phase with his political-security cabinet on Monday. Talks on phase two were due to start two weeks ago. Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation will go to Cairo Monday for discussions on phase one of the deal.
After a phone call with Netanyahu and top officials from Egypt and Qatar – the other mediating countries – US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday that he was confident phase two of the deal would take place.","['Irene Nasser', 'Jennifer Hansler', 'Mostafa Salem']",en

In a statement, HRF called for an arrest warrant for Sa’ar for “war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during Israel’s ongoing military assault on Gaza since October 7, 2023.”
The complaint comes ahead of the foreign minister’s expected trip to Brussels next week.
CNN has reached out to Sa’ar’s office for comment on the complaint. His spokesperson told CNN that Sa’ar will “carry out his planned visit to Brussels as scheduled.”
While neither Israel nor the United States is party to the ICC, Belgium is.
“As Belgium is a signatory to the Rome Statute, it has a legal obligation to cooperate with the ICC and take action against individuals accused of serious international crimes,” HRF said. “The Hind Rajab Foundation calls on Belgian authorities to ensure that Sa’ar does not evade justice while on European soil.”
“Allowing a suspected war criminal to visit Brussels unchallenged would be a betrayal of international legal commitments and the fundamental principles of justice,” the group added.
The HRF is a pro-Palestinian NGO that says it is dedicated “to breaking the cycle of Israeli impunity and honoring the memory of Hind Rajab and all those who have perished in the Gaza genocide.”
Rajab was a 5-year-old girl who was killed by Israeli tank fire while in her family’s car in Gaza.
The group said Sa’ar played a “central role” in making and implementing policies that have led to “mass displacement, collective punishment, and systematic attacks on Palestinian civilians.”
“His public statements and policy endorsements indicate direct and indirect participation in these crimes, as well as incitement to violence and obstruction of international justice mechanisms,” the group said.
HRF said Sa’ar publicly advocated for “reducing Gaza’s territory” and endorsed Israel’s “total blockade on Gaza, which has restricted food, water, and medical supplies.” HRF’s complaint also pointed toward “co-perpetration” with the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant, alongside former defense minister Yoav Gallant, in November last year.
The group has previously brought a lawsuit against a former Israeli soldier who was on vacation in Brazil, alleging he was responsible for war crimes while serving in Gaza. A Brazilian judge ordered police to investigate the soldier based on HRF’s complaint but he left the country.
That lawsuit was one of a series by the group, which has tracked the activities of hundreds of Israeli soldiers serving in Gaza.
The Israeli foreign ministry has since cautioned Israelis about social media posts related to their military service, saying “anti-Israeli elements may exploit these posts to initiate baseless legal proceedings against them.”","['Dana Karni', 'Hira Humayun']",en

The hostages - American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, Russian-Israeli Alexandre Troufanov and Argentinian-Israeli Iair Horn - were released in Khan Younis, southern Gaza in the sixth such exchange under the truce. They were seen exiting vehicles surrounded by militants, who ushered the hostages on stage, where the captives addressed the crowd.
The men appeared to be in better health than the three hostages released the previous week, whose condition drew condemnation from Israeli officials.
The three were given what appeared to be bags carrying memorabilia. Horn was seen carrying what appeared to be small hourglasses and Troufanov appeared to face some difficulty climbing down the stairs.
Following his return Dekel-Chen was seen walking through Sheba Medical Center in Israel with his wife Avital on Saturday to meet his sisters, Ofir and Dotan, in footage released by the Israeli government.
“There’s no place like home,” Dekel-Chen can be heard telling medical staff.
A crowd of armed militants gathered in Gaza ahead of the hostage release, which took place close to the house of slain former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, killed by Israel in October. Images showed masked fighters carrying weapons and gathering around a stage with flags and images depicting Sinwar and other militant leaders.
“No migration except to Jerusalem,” read a banner festooning the stage, in an apparent rebuke to US President Donald Trump and his plans for a mass displacement of Palestinians from the enclave.
Soon after, a spokesperson for the Israeli Prison Service said 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released on Saturday, the largest number yet under the truce.
The Palestinian Prisoners Society said that 333 Palestinians arrested in Gaza after the October 7 attack had arrived in the enclave Saturday.
Buses carrying the detainees entered Gaza from Kerem Shalom into Rafah, and headed to a hospital in Khan Younis where large crowds were waiting. Elsewhere, 36 Palestinians were released to the occupied West Bank, including 24 who were later exiled to Egypt.
Some of the released Palestinian prisoners and detainees were ordered to wear clothes provided by the Israeli Prison Service with the quote “We will not forget, and we will not forgive” inscribed next to a Star of David. The move infuriated Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who called it a “flagrant violation of all international and humanitarian laws.”
The released detainees later burned the uniforms, according to videos.
Interviews of released detainees filmed by CNN in Gaza were interrupted by tears and hugs from their family members.
Speaking in Gaza, Mohammad Saleh Al-Herbawi, a 42-year-old, told CNN he was arrested in late November at a civil administration checkpoint, and like other recently released Palestinians made allegations of abuse.
He said his time in Israeli prison had been “the worst three months” of his life. “Full of humiliation, beating, torture, and abuse,” he said. “They would tell us that dogs and animals are better than us, that we are lower than animals.”
The Israel Prison Service said it was not aware of the allegations and that “all basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards” in response to an inquiry by CNN.
Truce appears back on course
Earlier this week, Hamas said it was postponing Saturday’s releases after accusing Israel of violating its commitments to the ceasefire agreement. Amid the dispute, Trump urged Israel to cancel its deal with Hamas and “let all hell break out.”
Hamas later said it would go ahead with the releases following talks with mediators Egypt and Qatar, who they said would work to “remove obstacles and fill gaps.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office thanked Trump for his “clear and unequivocal” statement following the hostages’ release Saturday, saying it helped push Hamas to back down.
In a statement following the latest releases, Hamas said that the only way those still held captive would be freed was “through negotiations and by adhering to the requirements of the ceasefire agreement.”
All three men released on Saturday from Gaza were kidnapped from the kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 attack, and had been held captive for almost 500 days.
Troufanov was 27 years old when he was kidnapped by Palestinian Al-Quds Brigades, a militant group allied with Islamic Jihad, along with his grandmother, Irena Tati, his mother Lena Troufanov and girlfriend Sapir Cohen, who were all released in a previous deal. His father Vitaly was killed during the attack.
Dekel-Chen was 35 years old when he was kidnapped by Hamas while trying to defend the kibbutz from attackers. His wife Avital was pregnant with their third child during the attack, and gave birth to Dekel-Chen’s daughter while he was in captivity. She turned one in December.
Dekel-Chen’s family said that he will meet his daughter for the first time on Saturday.
Former US President Joe Biden expressed his relief Saturday that Dekel-Chen had been released, saying his “thoughts and prayers are with the remaining hostages and their families who have all been through hell. We hope all will be reunited in the weeks ahead.”
Horn, now 46, was also captured by Hamas with his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity.
The Gazan militants have now released a total of 19 Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, of a total of 33 promised at staggered intervals during this stage. Eight of those 33 are dead, according to the Israeli government.
Despite Saturday’s releases, uncertainty looms over the future of the wider agreement. Negotiations on extending the ceasefire – which expires on March 1 – are in doubt.
As well as taking hostages, Palestinian militants killed more than 1,200 people during the October 7 attack. Israeli bombardment of Gaza since has killed more than 48,000 people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, reduced much of the enclave to rubble, and led to a humanitarian catastrophe for surviving residents.
The war has spilled over into the wider region, putting Israel in conflict with key Hamas backer Iran, as well as Tehran proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.

Israel said Friday that Palestinian militants will release American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, Russian-Israeli Alexandre Troufanov and Argentinian-Israeli Iair Horn.
A release of 369 Palestinian prisoners by Israel is expected to follow, Hamas’ Prisoner Media Office said.
Troufanov was kidnapped at the age of 27 from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, 2023 along with his grandmother, Irena Tati, his mother Lena Troufanov and girlfriend Sapir Cohen, who were all released in a previous deal. His father Vitaly was killed during the attack.
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which kidnapped him, has released several videos of him in captivity.
Dekel-Chen was 35 years old when he was kidnapped while trying to defend Nir Oz from Hamas attackers. His wife Avital was pregnant with their third child during the attack. His daughter was born while he was in captivity and turned one in December.
Horn, now 46, was also captured from Nir Oz with his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity.
The announcement comes after a dispute this week between Hamas and Israel over the Gaza ceasefire. Hamas said it wouldn’t release Israeli hostages Saturday as planned due to alleged Israeli violations. The differences appeared to have been resolved on Thursday when Hamas said it would release the hostages as planned.
The spat was compounded by US President Donald Trump’s suggestion to dismiss the multi-staged approach of the ceasefire deal altogether and give Hamas an ultimatum to release all the hostages at once.
While Netanyahu welcomed Trump’s demand, he didn’t explicitly agree to it. Instead he issued an ambiguous statement, saying Hamas must “return our hostages by Saturday noon” – without giving a figure – or the military “will return to intense fighting until Hamas is completely defeated.”
David Mencer, spokesman at the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said Thursday that while the return of all hostages is a key war objective, Israel would end the ceasefire in Gaza if three live hostages were not released on Saturday by noon local time.
‘Unimaginable conditions’
In a video message to US President Donald Trump on Friday, former Israeli-American hostage Keith Siegel asked the American leader to help bring back remaining captives.
“I was held for 484 days in unimaginable conditions, and every single day felt like it could be my last. President Trump, you are the reason I am home alive. Please bring them home,” Siegel, who was released from Hamas captivity two weeks ago, said.
Former hostage Or Levy, who was released last Saturday, visited Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square on Friday and said that while he has been freed, “I still have many brothers and sisters in the hell of Gaza, and their time is running out.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which coordinates the exchanges, said on Friday that it remains “very concerned about the conditions of the hostages.”
“The latest release operations reinforce the urgent need for ICRC access to those held hostage,” it said on X, adding that “we have consistently reiterated that release and transfer operations should be carried out in a dignified and safe manner.”
Israel has protested against the way Hamas choreographed previous releases, often parading hostages on stage in front of large audiences and having them surrounded by armed militants in a show of force.
The three male Israeli hostages freed in the fifth round of exchanges appeared gaunt and frail, their condition condemned as “shocking” by Israel.
Palestinian prisoners released by Israel have also reported mistreatment during their detention and release.
One former prisoner, Rula Hassanein, told CNN she and other prisoners were forced to watch a 90-second Israeli propaganda video on a large screen for hours ahead of their release. The Israel Prison Service (IPS) at the time said it wasn’t aware of the allegations.
So far, 16 out of 33 Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals scheduled for release in the current phase of the agreement have been freed by Palestinian militants, and 656 Palestinian prisoners from a list of nearly 2,000 have been released by Israel.",['Abbas Al Lawati'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/politics/us-intelligence-israel-strike-iran-nuclear/index.html,US intelligence agencies believe Israel is likely to strike Iranian nuclear facilities this year,2025-02-13 21:54:58,"US intelligence agencies recently warned both the Biden and Trump administrations that Israel will likely attempt to strike facilities key to Iran’s nuclear program this year, according to sources familiar with the assessments.
Israel’s willingness to use military force runs counter to President Donald Trump’s current desire for a peace deal with Tehran, and the recent US intelligence cautions that major strikes on Iranian nuclear sites could increase the risk of a wider war breaking out in the Middle East.
Overall, Israel is also still pursuing the broader goal of causing regime change in Iran, one of the recent US intelligence reports says.
The action Israel is considering taking would go further than its targeted strikes on military targets in Iran last year in retaliation for the ballistic missile attacks Tehran launched on Israel which it said were in response to the Israeli killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut.
Taken together, the US intelligence assessments reflect the competing interests confronting the Trump administration as it navigates tensions in the Middle East surrounding Israel.
Trump has stated he wants to strike a nuclear deal with Tehran, a goal that would put off – for now at least – Israeli military action.
The president said last week that he prefers a “verified nuclear peace agreement” over joint military action with Israel that would “blow Iran into smithereens.”
“I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it,” Trump said in an interview with the New York Post.
Iranian officials said earlier this month they have not had contact with the Trump administration about talks.
CNN has reached out the Israeli embassy in Washington for comment.
A White House official declined to comment, citing “intelligence matters.”
The US intelligence assessments were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Israel would need American help
At least one US intelligence report produced by the Pentagon in recent weeks suggests Israel’s intent is to destroy both Iran’s nuclear facilities as well as its ballistic missile capability, and that Israel’s ultimate goal remains taking down the Iranian regime, two sources familiar with the intelligence said.
Complicating Israel’s military planning is the simple fact that they don’t have the capacity to destroy Iran’s nuclear program without American assistance, including mid-air refueling and the bombs required to penetrate the facilities deep underground, a need that is also reflected in the recent US intelligence report, according to the sources.
“If you want to do a real, a total attack where you take out everything, only the United States can do it,” said a former senior Biden administration official who said that Israel is “constantly” considering their options for striking Iran.
But the US intelligence assessment highlights the fact that Trump’s calculus on Iran is likely to face pressures from multiple directions, including Israel’s desire for additional military action against Iran. During his first term, Trump both shuttered the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Tehran and ordered a US-led strike on Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020, two actions that suggest Trump’s current stated desire of diplomacy with Iran may not ultimately last.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was the first world leader Trump invited to the White House in his second term and the two are staunch political allies. With the Israeli prime minister sitting next to him, Trump suggested permanently removing the Palestinians from Gaza so it could be rebuilt, a proposal that broke sharply with traditional US policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but was cheered by Netanyahu, who said that Trump had a “revolutionary and creative vision” that was “much better for the state of Israel.”
It remains to be seen how Netanyahu will leverage his relationship with the president on the issue of Iran.
Israel argued it should take advantage of Tehran’s weakened state
In the weeks leading up to the 2024 US presidential election, Israeli officials raised the idea of additional strikes with Biden administration officials on at least a handful of occasions, making the argument they should take advantage of Iran’s weakened state and go further, targeting its nuclear program, a former senior Biden official told CNN.
Israel’s October 25, 2024, bombings of Iran’s missile production facilities and air defenses – combined with an economy weakened by sanctions and Israel’s decimation of Iran’s regional proxies – has left Tehran in its weakest position militarily in decades.
Israel notably did not target any Iranian nuclear facilities in October. Biden had warned Israel against it and said publicly he wanted Israel to strike back at Iran “proportionally” following the Iranian bombing of Israel on October 1, 2024, which included some 200 ballistic missiles but did limited damage.
Israel did want to go further. US intelligence last fall assessed that Israel was considering unilateral attacks on nuclear sites with the hope that public pressure in the United States would convince the Biden administration to join them, a person familiar with the intelligence told CNN.
The Biden administration was open to the idea, and, to some degree, explored whether the success of Israel’s October strikes against non-nuclear targets in Iran had opened up new opportunities, the former senior official said.
But those discussions between Israeli and Biden officials stopped after Trump’s November election win, as a decision was made that preemptive military strikes would not take place during the transition period, the former official added.
At that time, US and Israeli officials agreed that any move by Iran to jump start its nuclear weapons program would still prompt a military response, and they saw no evidence of a shift in Iran’s posture before Trump was sworn into office, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
Israel also knew that it would be contending with a new administration likely to want to strike a deal and had already turned its focus toward engaging with Trump’s transition team.
But Trump’s desire for a deal does not appear to have tempered Israel’s desire for taking additional military action against Iran to capitalize on the destruction inflicted during its most recent round of strikes at the end of October.
The more recent US intelligence assessment suggests Israel has not determined if it would attempt to carry out strikes using military aircraft or long-range missiles, but either option would seek to capitalize on Iran’s degraded air defense capabilities, two sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN.
But it also described how such strikes would only minimally set the Iranian nuclear program back and wouldn’t be a cure-all to ending it, according to one of those sources.
Trump recently tapped his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to oversee diplomatic engagement with Iran. Witkoff is widely viewed as a “deal maker,” in contrast to the Iran hawks Trump surrounded himself with during his first term. Even before taking office, Witkoff had worked with his Biden administration counterpart on sealing a ceasefire in Gaza, which he continues to manage negotiations on.
Trump also recently distanced himself from former officials who had pushed a more aggressive stance towards Iran, like Brian Hook, whose departure has been viewed as another sign the President is interested in taking a more diplomatic approach.
At the same time, Trump’s decision to strip former officials of their security details, despite them still facing threats from Iran for their role in killing Soleimani, is viewed by some officials as a result of his shifting posture.
But Trump has yet to reveal precisely what US relations with Tehran will look like after tensions rose to unprecedented levels with Israel in the fallout of the Israel-Hamas war.","['Zachary Cohen', 'Jeremy Herb', 'Alex Marquardt']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/middleeast/israel-hostages-mothers/index.html,Moms of freed young Israeli hostages detail what their daughters endured as Hamas captives,2025-02-13 17:40:47,"Daniella Gilboa has wasted no time in putting the joy back into her life after being released from 15 months in captivity in Gaza. She got engaged to her longtime boyfriend and sang at a party when she and other freed hostages left the hospital.
“Daniella is happy to be free, she’s happy to do things that she likes without anyone telling her … not to do it,” her mother Orly told CNN. “She understands that we just live once, and she wants to do everything. She’s just a young girl.”
But Orly knows that what she is seeing in these first days after Daniella’s release is just the surface. “There are a lot of things under and I’m sure that we can see them when the days go by.”
It’s the same for Naama Levy and Liri Albag, released alongside Daniella on January 25, their mothers said. They appear physically healthy, and they are home. But they were imprisoned in Gaza for 477 days and free less than three weeks, so much of their recovery is yet to come.
“She’s back in her room,” Ayelet Levy Shachar said of her daughter and her girly pink bedroom complete with soft toys. “Although she does prefer to sleep with her mom at night.”
Naama, Liri and Daniella were all in their teens on October 7, 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed their outpost at Kibbutz Nahal Oz near the border with Gaza.
They were performing their mandatory military service as unarmed “spotters,” tasked with looking at activity inside Gaza and reporting back to commanders at another base.
Fifteen of their fellow spotters were killed in the surprise militant attack on communities and a music festival that left 1,200 Israelis dead and 250 kidnapped in the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The Israeli war on Hamas that followed has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, injured twice as many and leveled much of Gaza.
Daniella, Liri and Naama were captured with four more young women: Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Ori Megidish and Noa Marciano. Ori was rescued weeks after the attack, while Noa was killed in Gaza. Karina was also released on January 25, while Agam was freed five days later.
Video taken by Hamas on October 7 and later released by the women’s families showed the female soldiers being lined up against a wall by men with rifles. Their hands were bound behind them, and they were ordered to sit, many still in their pajamas, their faces and bodies spattered with blood.
On the day of the attack, with no word from Naama, Ayelet had first thought maybe her daughter was just unable to reach her in the chaos. But then she saw a video of Naama being dragged by her hair, her pants covered in blood, and being shoved into a vehicle.
It became one of the most viral and searing videos of the Hamas attack, one which Ayelet told CNN she could not watch in its entirety. But like so many other family members of the stolen Israelis, she did interviews and wrote op-eds to keep attention on her child and raise pressure for a solution.
And unknown to her, her daughter saw it too.
“She saw the video, she knew about it, and she did see myself and her father in different interviews,” Ayelet said. “She heard sometimes on the radio her brother speaking, her grandfather speaking. It wasn’t an everyday thing, but sometimes she was exposed to the media, and it did give her a lot of strength and support and helped her throughout those days.
“She waited to catch a glimpse of one of us. She told me even that she was following with the color of my hair during this time,” Ayelet added with a laugh.
Naama was wounded by shrapnel that day. Some she was later able to pick out of her skin; the rest remains in her body, Ayelet said.
Naama and Liri had only arrived at the outpost a couple of days before the attack, but Daniella had already been there nine months, her mom said.
Orly knows Daniella was hit in the leg that day, but much else is still unknown.
“October 7 is the most hard thing for her to speak about, and I don’t ask her about it,” Orly said. “She didn’t tell me yet about what happened that day. I just know that she lost a lot of her good friends … The loss of them is very hard for her, even more than the period of time of the captivity … I assume that in a few days or a few months, she’ll decide to talk about it, and she will tell me about it herself. I don’t want to make any pain for her.”
The mothers have learned a little about the conditions their girls, all now 20 years old, were kept in.
Shira Albag said Liri was held with Agam Berger, and sometimes Naama.
“Liri most of the time was in apartments with civilians,” she said. “It was difficult because they needed to do some things for the people of the house — to clean the house and to cook for them and to sit with the children and try to teach them English or play with them.”
Despite the physical closeness, there was little human kindness. “They didn’t treat them nice,” she said of the captors.
Amit Soussana, a woman freed in November 2023, has credited Liri for saving her life. She said the militants were convinced she was in the Israeli military and tied her up and beat her as they demanded a confession. At one point, other hostages were brought in to pressure her. Instead, Liri spoke to the guard and persuaded the captors that Amit was not a soldier.
“It seems like Liri, but I heard this story from Amit. Liri didn’t tell us yet the story,” Shira said. “I know it was very difficult for her. She saved Amit’s life. But when Liri will be ready, she will tell the story herself.”
Liri, Daniella and Naama were, along with Karina Ariev, the second group of hostages to be released under the first phase of the ceasefire deal. In a highly choreographed handover, they were paraded on a stage, dressed in olive-green military style outfits, and given certificates about their release and “gift bags” including souvenir keychains.
Their release was in marked contrast to the chaotic first handover of the 2025 truce and they seemed healthier than the three pale, emaciated men freed on Saturday.
Daniella watched that last release with her mother and talked about the condition of one of the men — her cousin Eli Sharabi.
“Daniella told me, ‘Mama, just know that if we were released two months ago, I looked like Eli’ because she also lost a lot of weight there,” Orly said. A change happened two or three months ago when Daniella and Karina were separated from other captives. And instead of four of them having to share one plate of food, then it was just two.
“It’s important to understand that we see Daniella, how she looks like right now, it doesn’t mean anything about what happened there and how she felt there.”
Hamas and its allies still hold a total of 73 people — some believed to be dead — taken from Israel during the October 7 attacks. Three additional hostages, held captive since 2014, are also still in Gaza.
Ayelet took time to thank US President Donald Trump for getting the ceasefire deal done and allowing the release of hostages. The terms of the deal map closely to an agreement then-President Joe Biden unveiled last May but could not complete.
Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister until November, told Israel’s Channel 12 News earlier this month that Hamas had agreed to that deal in July, but Israel did not go along with it.
“Unfortunately, there are fewer hostages still alive now, more time has passed, and we are paying a heavier price,” he said.
Ayelet echoed that sentiment. “They could have been home sooner. They should have been home sooner,” she said.
The drive and passion shown by the families and much of Israel over nearly 500 days to get the hostages freed is ramping up to a new urgency as the truce — and hope for more releases — hangs by a thread.
“We need to see them all home now,” Ayelet said.","['Bianna Golodryga', 'Sarah Boxer', 'Rachel Clarke']",en

https://www.cnn.com/world/2024-deadliest-year-journalists-israel-cpj-intl/index.html,"2024 was the deadliest year for journalists. Most were killed by Israel, report says",2025-02-13 16:19:27,"Last year was the deadliest for journalists in more than three decades, with the majority killed in the Middle East, according to a report released Wednesday by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
At least 124 journalists and media workers were killed in 2024, the most recorded since the CPJ began collecting data three decades ago.
Nearly 70% of those deaths were at the hands of the Israeli military in Gaza and Lebanon, the report said, with 82 Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces denied targeting media workers, saying it “takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists.”
“Remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks,” it said in a lengthy statement to CNN, defending its operations in Gaza and Lebanon.
Last year’s death toll exceeded the previous record in 2007, when 113 journalists were killed, almost half of them amid the US-led war in Iraq.
“The war in Gaza is unprecedented in its impact on journalists and demonstrates a major deterioration in global norms on protecting journalists in conflict zones, but it is far from the only place journalists are in danger,” the committee’s CEO Jodie Ginsberg said in a statement.
It accused Israel of being “slow and not transparent” in its inquiries into soldiers’ killings of journalists, of shifting blame to the victims and ignoring its duty to hold its military to account.
After Gaza and Lebanon, the report identified Sudan and Pakistan as the deadliest places for journalists, with six media workers killed in each last year. Mexico, Syria, Myanmar, Iraq and Haiti also had multiple killings of journalists in 2024.
“The number of conflicts globally – whether political, criminal, or military in nature – has doubled in the past five years, and this is reflected in the high number of deaths of journalists in nations such as Sudan, Pakistan, and Myanmar,” the CPJ said, citing data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) monitoring initiative.
Targeted killings on the rise
The CPJ report said at least 24 journalists worldwide had been killed deliberately because of their work over the past year, describing this as “an alarming rise in the number of targeted killings.”
Among them was Ismail Al-Ghoul, a 27-year-old Palestinian journalist, who was killed alongside his cameraman, Rami Al-Rifi, in an Israeli airstrike on Al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza last July, sparking condemnation from advocacy groups.
The IDF said in its statement to CNN that Al-Ghoul was a member of Hamas’ military wing and had “participated” in the October 7 attack on Israel, reiterating claims it had made at the time of the attack.
In the immediate aftermath of Al-Ghoul’s killing, his employer, Al Jazeera, denied what it called “baseless allegations made by the Israeli occupation forces in an attempt to justify its deliberate killing of our colleague, journalist Ismail Al-Ghoul, and his companion, cameraman Rami Al-Rifi.”
The IDF has rarely provided specific answers about the circumstances that led to the killing of journalists. Instead, the Israeli military has issued vague statements that reiterate their forces do not intentionally target journalists or that the matter is under investigation.
Trapped in the strip alongside their fellow Gaza residents, Palestinian reporters have been the eyes and ears of those suffering under the shadow of war. And with foreign media largely unable to enter, it is their photos, footage and reporting, often gathered at great personal risk, that have shown the world what is happening.
The committee said 10 journalists were deliberately killed by Israel in Gaza and Lebanon. The 14 other journalists whose deaths it determined were deliberate were from Haiti, Mexico, Pakistan, Myanmar, Mozambique, India, Iraq, and Sudan.
Failures to protect press
The report highlighted the ongoing failures to protect journalists and media workers, especially freelancers, in countries with consistently high rates of killings.
It cited the killing of a veteran journalist, Alejandro Martínez Noguez, who was shot last August in Mexico while under police protection as an example of the “persistent flaws” in the country’s mechanisms meant to protect journalists.
“The death tolls in Mexico, Pakistan, India, and Iraq reinforced the extreme dangers journalists face in these nations, which have experienced repeated killings over multiple decades despite numerous efforts in some of these countries, including at the national level, to address this,” the report said.
Freelancers, it said, were killed at an “unprecedented rate” last year. A total of 43 were killed, more than a third of all media worker deaths, the majority of which were Palestinians in Gaza.
“The typical freelancer frequently works alone, without staffers’ access to protective equipment, security guards, insurance for medical treatment, or benefits that would help surviving family members,” the report said.
It called on governments, international institutions and media organizations to ensure accountability for threats and attacks against journalists and to provide media workers with the necessary support to do their work.",['Lucas Lilieholm'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/middleeast/hamas-hostage-release-israel-gaza-intl/index.html,"Hamas says it will release hostages as planned, potentially resolving ceasefire spat with Israel",2025-02-13 10:41:57,"The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears to be back on track after Hamas said it will release Israeli hostages this weekend as initially planned.
Israel and Hamas had been locked in a dispute over the Gaza ceasefire, with the spat threatening to derail an agreement that brought an end to over a year of fighting and with the next steps still to be resolved.
Israeli officials declined to immediately confirm that Israel will abide by the terms of the ceasefire if Hamas releases three hostages as planned, but they are optimistic that a deal will be reached to avert the collapse of the ceasefire agreement.
“Seems it will be resolved,” one Israeli official said, adding there is no appetite in Israeli government leadership to abandon the ceasefire agreement at this time.
The militant group had postponed the release of more hostages this weekend, accusing Israel of violating the truce. In response, Israel warned it would return to fighting.
After talks with key mediators Egypt and Qatar, Hamas said that the releases – which will see Palestinian prisoners exchanged in return – will go ahead.
“Hamas confirms its continued position to implement the deal according to what was signed, which includes exchanging prisoners according to the specified timetable,” a statement by the militant group said.
“The talks were characterized by a positive spirit,” the statement said, adding that Egypt and Qatar affirmed they would work to “remove obstacles and fill gaps.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not responded to Hamas’ statement, which also comes amid continued fallout over US President Donald Trump’s suggestion to relocate Gaza’s residents and redevelop the territory.
Trump has suggested dismissing the multi-staged approach of the ceasefire deal altogether and giving Hamas an ultimatum to release all the hostages at once.
While Netanyahu welcomed Trump’s demand, he hasn’t explicitly agreed to it – instead issuing an ambiguous statement, saying Hamas must “return our hostages by Saturday noon” – without giving a figure – or the military “will return to intense fighting until Hamas is completely defeated.”
Prime Minister’s Office Spokesman David Mencer said Thursday that while the return of all hostages is a key war objective, Israel will end the ceasefire in Gaza if three live hostages are not released on Saturday by noon local time.
“There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages. There are important markers, there are important steps on this framework. That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday,” Mencer told reporters.
So far, 16 out of 33 Israeli hostages scheduled for release in the current phase of the agreement have been freed by Hamas, and 656 Palestinian prisoners from a list of nearly 2,000 have been released by Israel.
In its statement on Thursday, Hamas said mediators pledged to follow up on its demands for Israel to allow the entry of housing supplies, medical equipment, fuel, and relief aid. The group also said mediators confirmed they would “remove obstacles” to resuming the ceasefire agreement.
Alleged Israeli violations
Meanwhile, an Egyptian source with knowledge of the matter has alleged Israel has committed numerous violations to the ceasefire.
The source shared with CNN a detailed list of 19 alleged violations by Israel. These include restrictions on the delivery of aid and reconstruction material and equipment, firing at and killing civilians, and 105 incidents of surveillance aircraft spotted during the agreed no-fly periods.
Twenty-two people were killed and 59 others injured by Israeli fire outside the buffer zone separating Gaza and Israel, and Israeli military vehicles ventured into the area adjacent to the Philadelphi corridor, which separates Egypt and Gaza, on a daily basis, according to the list shared by the Egyptian source.
COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages policy for the Palestinian territories, told CNN that Israel is committed to fulfilling its obligation to allow 600 aid trucks into Gaza daily.
“As part of this, since the beginning of the agreement, more than 15,000 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza. The trucks contain food, water, fuel and gas, medicine and medical equipment, and of course tents and shelter equipment,” it said. “According to our data, since the agreement took effect, hundreds of thousands of tents have entered the Strip. Additionally, tractors have been brought into the Strip in accordance with the agreement.”
Egypt is a key mediator in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations, along with Qatar and the United States.
The source cast doubt on Israel’s commitment to the truce, noting the delay in negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire and the “prohibitive and unacceptable conditions” set by the negotiating parties.
Statements by Israeli politicians “calling for the displacement of the Gaza population give the impression that Israel doesn’t want to continue the implementation of the agreement and works to implement President Trump’s displacement plan,” the source told CNN.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Sarah Sirgany', 'Nadeen Ebrahim']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/middleeast/analysis-trump-gaza-jordan-king-intl-latam/index.html,Analysis: Trump’s Gaza ‘Riviera’ vision needed an Arab reality check. King Abdullah’s visit only encouraged it,2025-02-13 00:53:07,"It was supposed to be the moment US President Donald Trump’s vision of bringing peace to the Middle East by redeveloping the war-torn Gaza strip into “Riviera” style premium housing and permanently relocating its more than 2 million residents finally got a reality check.
Instead, it was the moment the true scale of the challenge facing America’s Arab allies became clear.
When King Abdullah II of Jordan met Trump at the Oval Office on Tuesday, there were widespread expectations that his visit – as the first Arab leader to meet the US president since his reelection – might help to rein in some of the more far-fetched elements of Trump’s vision. (To recap, Trump apparently envisions the US taking control of the territory, rehoming millions of Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Egypt, replacing the rubble of Gaza with glass towers with Mediterranean views and inviting “the world’s people” to move in.)
But it became clear almost as soon as Trump began talking at their joint press conference that he had no intention whatsoever of softening his proposal.
“I believe we will have a parcel of land in Jordan, a parcel of land in Egypt, we may have some place else but I think when we finish our talks we’ll have a place where they’ll live very happily,” Trump said, before brushing aside questions about what authority the US might wield to take control of the Palestinian enclave.
The embarrassment to King Abdullah, whose eyes twitched extensively as he listened quietly beside the US president, was clear.
After all, this was a man who was expected to – diplomatically – state in clear terms the Arab world’s almost universal opposition to the plan.
Instead, and despite his clear discomfort, he appeared to nod and praised Trump as a man of peace who could take the Middle East “across the finish line.”
Asked whether he agrees with Trump’s proposal to rehome the Palestinians, the king deflected, instead revealing that “Egypt and the Arab countries” had an alternative plan that would be revealed in due course and advising, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”
“You could see the discomfort on the king’s body language and his face … they were completely talking past each other,” said Khaled Elgindy, visiting scholar at the Georgetown University Center for Contemporary Arab Studies.
A ‘bad bet’
Until that point, Egypt had said nothing publicly about having a counter-plan. Afterwards it issued its own vague statement, in which it referred to an “intention to present a comprehensive vision for the reconstruction of Gaza.”
Meanwhile, Arab social media erupted in criticism of the king, who was widely criticized for appearing to capitulate to Trump.
In what looked like an attempt at damage limitation, the king posted on X that he had “reiterated Jordan’s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.”
“This is the unified Arab position. Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,” he wrote.
But by then, in many Arab eyes, the damage had already been done.
While Abdullah may have impressed Trump with his offer to take 2,000 of Gaza’s sick children, it’s clear his visit did little to persuade the president away from his desire to take Gaza. If anything, the limpness of the opposition may only have encouraged Trump.
“We’re going to have it (Gaza), we’re going to keep it, and we’re going to make sure that there’s going to be peace and there’s not going to be any problem, and nobody’s going to question it, and we’re going to run it very properly,” Trump said.
Randa Slim, a fellow at the foreign policy institute at Johns Hopkins University, said the king had made a “bad bet” in traveling to Washington.
“If the visit was aimed at helping sway Trump to abandon his plan, King Abdullah was unsuccessful because Trump doubled down. And it did not put the Jordanian king in the best light with his own population, he did not come across in the public presser as strongly pushing back against a plan which the majority of his population opposes,” she said.
“I don’t think it was a success on a regional and domestic level,” Slim added.
A precarious position
The exchange between Trump and the king reveals the precarious position that America’s Arab allies could find themselves in over the next four years, especially those, like Jordan, who have relatively little in terms of natural resources to offer the self-styled master of the deal.
As Arab countries scramble to make a counteroffer to Trump’s Gaza plan, they are also rushing to salvage the ceasefire agreement, which is currently under threat of collapse after Hamas said it would postpone Saturday’s scheduled hostage release in response to alleged Israeli violations of the deal in recent weeks.
If there is a silver lining to the “madness coming out of Trump’s mouth,” said Elgindy, it’s that it spurred Arab states to think about what their own, more credible alternative would be – even if that action is long overdue.
“It took disastrous statements by Trump and the possible collapse of the ceasefire for them to finally spur into action … that should have happened months ago,” he said.
The plan alluded to by King Abdullah, to be presented by Egypt after being discussed with one of Trump’s closest Arab allies, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, could present a vision where Arab countries help clear the rubble and rebuild Gaza over several years, without Palestinians leaving and in line with the two-state solution.
But the finer details of the Arab plan are yet to be revealed and the danger is that any delay will only serve to encourage Trump further. Egypt has said there will be an Arab emergency summit at the end of the month.
For some Arab leaders, the hope is that Trump will at some point come to his own conclusion that his plan is “not practical” and “unimplementable,” Slim said, and that there will be so many obstacles in implementing it that he will abandon it.
Even then, the onus would be on America’s Arab allies to come up with a solution to a decades-old problem, and the king’s visit to DC has hardly inspired confidence.
“They are caught between a rock and a hard place … they will have to come up with an alternative plan that has to involve dollars for Trump to buy into it, and one that he can spin as a win,” Slim added.
“Come on,” said Elgindy. “Nobody has a plan?”",['Mostafa Salem'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-intl/index.html,How the fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal could unravel,2025-02-11 16:36:06,"It’s only three weeks into a fragile ceasefire, and Israel and Hamas are each ratcheting up allegations that the other party has violated the deal.
So far, 16 out of 33 hostages scheduled for release in the current phase of the agreement have been freed by Hamas, and 656 Palestinian prisoners from a list of nearly 2,000 have been released by Israel. But the weekly exchanges may now be disrupted after Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement and said it would postpone Saturday’s hostage release “until further notice.”
Israel has hit back, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying late Tuesday that the Gaza ceasefire will end if Hamas does not release hostages as planned on Saturday.
“If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon - the ceasefire will end, and the IDF will return to intense fighting until Hamas is completely defeated,” he said in a video statement.
US President Donald Trump, whose envoy helped mediate the agreement along with officials from Egypt and Qatar, has suggested dismissing the multi-staged approach of the deal altogether and giving Hamas an ultimatum to release all the hostages at once.
While some Israeli politicians have endorsed Trump’s ultimatum, Netanyahu has not explicitly agreed to it – instead issuing an ambiguous statement.
In his statement on Tuesday, he “welcomed President Trump’s demand,” but didn’t specify how many hostages should be released.
“If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end, and the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) will return to intense fighting until Hamas is completely defeated,” Netanyahu said in a video statement.
Here’s what each side is saying, and where the deal could go from here:
Hamas says Israel violated the deal
On Monday, Hamas threatened to postpone the next hostage release, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire deal by targeting Palestinians with gunfire in various parts of Gaza, delaying the return of displaced people to the heavily bombarded north, and not allowing the agreed humanitarian aid to enter the enclave.
The militant group also accused Israel of delaying the entry of essential medicines and hospital supplies, as well as not allowing tents, prefabricated houses, fuel, or rubble-removing machines into Gaza.
On Tuesday, the Gaza health ministry said that 92 people in the enclave had been killed in Israeli military operations since the ceasefire came into effect.
CNN has asked Israeli authorities for comment on the allegations regarding casualties.
A diplomat with knowledge of the ceasefire talks told CNN that the United Nations, Qatar and other countries had requested to deliver temporary shelters to Gaza but Israel turned them down.
Aid agencies say that delivery of aid needs to be accelerated. Doctors Without Borders said Wednesday that “humanitarian needs remain huge. We’re still not seeing the scale up of aid needed.”
The World Food Programme says it hopes to double the amount of bread being provided in northern Gaza within the next few days. However, it said that there is still not enough food inside Gaza to meet the immense needs, and a massive influx of humanitarian and commercial food products is needed.
Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas’ armed wing, said in a social media post on Monday: “We affirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement as long as the occupation commits to them.”
In a later statement, Hamas added that there was still an opportunity for the release to go forward as planned, saying that Israel has sufficient time “to fulfill its obligations.”
Israel says delay is ‘complete violation’ of deal
Hamas’ postponement is a “complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and the deal to release the hostages,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Monday.
The Israeli agency responsible for enabling aid to enter Gaza, COGAT, told CNN Tuesday that Hamas’ claims about ceasefire violations were completely false, adding that hundreds of thousands of tents have entered Gaza since the beginning of the agreement, as well as fuel, and generators.
Katz said he instructed the military to “prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza.” The Israeli military also said it was raising the level of readiness in southern Israel and that it would reinforce the area to enhance its “readiness for various scenarios.”
And Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Tuesday his country is “prepared for the fact that Hamas may try to attack Israel.”
Those announcements also come after Israeli forces opened fire on Sunday in the eastern areas of Gaza City, close to the Gaza border, killing three Palestinians, Palestinian authorities said. The incident happened close to the border fence near Nahal Oz, an Israeli kibbutz, or agricultural commune. Following that incident, Katz said: “Anyone who enters the buffer zone, their blood is on their own head – zero tolerance for anyone who threatens IDF (Israel Defense Forces) forces or the fence area and communities.”
Doubts about the future of the deal also follow Israel’s condemnation of the gaunt, frail appearance of the hostages released last week as “shocking.” Many of the remaining Israeli hostages are believed to be in even worse condition, Israeli government officials told CNN on Tuesday.
What did Trump say?
President Trump has urged Israel to “let all hell break out” and cancel the ceasefire and hostages deal if Hamas does not return those still being held in Gaza by Saturday.
“As far as I’m concerned, if all of the hostages aren’t returned by Saturday at 12 o’clock – I think it’s an appropriate time – I would say, cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.
Trump added that all hostages ought to be returned, not two or three “in drips and drabs,” which is the phased manner of releases outlined in the deal.
Pressed on what “all hell” might entail in Gaza, Trump said, “You’ll find out, and they’ll find out – Hamas will find out what I mean.”
Trump and his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are part of the team that helped broker the ceasefire, which was finalized with cooperation between the Biden and Trump camps just before the new administration took office.
The US president went on to say that Palestinians would not have a right to return to Gaza under his plan to take US ownership of the enclave and rebuild it.
Trump also told reporters on Monday: “I think a lot of the hostages are dead.” More than 30 of the hostages are dead, according to Israel.
On Tuesday, during a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah, Trrump expressed doubt as to whether Hamas would meet the Saturday deadline.
How likely is the ceasefire to hold?
In short, no one knows.
It took about a year of negotiations to reach the current deal. The first ceasefire, in November 2023, lasted about a week.
Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Tuesday said there will be a “complete occupation of the Gaza Strip,” if Hamas fails to release hostages as planned. He called on Netanyahu to cease essential services to Gaza including electricity, water, fuel and aid, unless Hamas releases hostages on Saturday.
The families of hostages held in Gaza have, however, urged the prime minister to stick to the ceasefire agreement.
“Prime minister, you made the decision to bring all our hostages home through an agreement. We must not go backwards,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Tuesday.
The current agreement is set up to progress in three distinct phases, the first of which is already halfway through.
As well as the release of 16 hostages so far, phase one has seen the entry of more humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Gaza. The Israeli military has retained its presence along Gaza’s borders with Egypt and Israel.
Israel has to date released around a third of the nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners agreed for the exchange, some of them held without charge, and others facing life sentences.
Following Israel’s withdrawal from a key militarized zone dividing Gaza, Palestinians began returning to what’s left of their homes in the heavily bombarded north. The “overwhelming destruction of homes and communities in the north” has left people without viable shelter, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has said “the need for food, water, tents and shelter materials in that area remains critical.”
Meanwhile, negotiations for the second and third phases have barely started.
An Israeli delegation was sent to Doha, Qatar, on Sunday, but an Israeli official told CNN that the team would not be discussing the second phase of the deal, adding that Netanyahu was planning separately to hold “a security-political cabinet meeting” this week regarding the second phase.
Netanyahu waited until last weekend – one week after a deadline for further ceasefire talks – to send his delegation to Qatar. Israeli media has speculated that he is simply running out the clock until phase one of the deal expires on March 1.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a key member of Netanyahu’s coalition, has threatened to quit the government if Israel doesn’t return to war after the first phase of the truce.
Qatari and Egyptian mediators are engaging with Israel and Hamas to solve “current issues” and ensure adherence to the agreement, a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told CNN.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/macron-trump-gaza-real-estate-intl/index.html,French President Macron calls for respect for Palestinians in Gaza,2025-02-11 21:16:47,"Amid the maelstrom of indignation around Donald Trump’s proposal to “take over” Gaza, French President Emmanuel Macron has called for “respect” for Palestinians and their Arab neighbors, batting away the US president’s idea of a mass displacement of Gazans from their homeland.
“You cannot say to 2 million people, ‘okay, now guess what? You will move,’” Macron told CNN in an exclusive interview recorded on Thursday at the Elysee Palace ahead of this week’s AI summit.
“The right answer is not a real estate operation, this is a political operation,” he said.
While France has been forthright in its support for Israel’s right to defend itself after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, massacre, Macron has not shied from publicly decrying Israel’s policies and conduct in its military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.
France suspended arms exports to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2024, calling on other nations to follow suit.
“I always reiterated my disagreement with (Israeli) Prime Minister Netanyahu,” Macron said. “I don’t believe, once again, that such a massive operation targeting sometimes civilian people is the right answer.”
Macron said any “efficient” response to rebuilding Gaza “doesn’t mean automatically that you should lack respect to people or countries,” highlighting the wishes of Palestinians to remain on their homelands and the unwillingness of both Jordan and Egypt to accept large numbers of Gazan refugees.
The provocative proposal lofted by Trump outlined a plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, with the US taking “long-term ownership” of the enclave.
Trump stirred up storms of criticism for bigging up Gaza’s real estate potential, suggesting he could redevelop it into a “Middle Eastern Riviera.”
It’s not the first time those in Trump’s orbit floated that idea. Last year, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who served as a senior adviser to Trump in his first term, suggested “cleaning up” Gaza by booting out civilians to unlock the “very valuable” waterfront potential of the territory.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed Trump’s “remarkable idea” during a visit to the US last week. In recent months Israel has seen a wave of far-right settler groups planning and advocating for the redevelopment of Gaza, calling for Arab people to leave and to re-establish Jewish settlements.
Any such land grab from the Palestinians would be illegal under international law, and likely to spark further global condemnation.
Already, like France, the international community has come out vocally against Trump’s plans.
The United Nations was robust, its secretary-general warning Trump against “ethnic cleansing.” Spain’s foreign minister told radio station RNE that “Gazans’ land is Gaza.” In Western Europe, only Dutch far-right figurehead Geert Wilders broke ranks to endorse the plan. “Let Palestinians move to Jordan. Gaza-problem solved!” he wrote on X.
German President Walter Steinmeier said the suggestion was “unacceptable,” and the country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said it would “lead to new suffering and new hatred.”
But some allies have tried to play both sides, keeping Trump happy while trying to uphold longheld norms over Palestinian rights. “On the issue of Gaza, Donald Trump is right,” UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy told reporters in Ukraine this week. “Looking at those scenes, Palestinians who have been horrendously displaced over so many months of war, it is clear that Gaza is lying in rubble.”
Lammy went on to add: “We have always been clear in our view that we must see two states and we must see Palestinians able to live and prosper in their homelands in Gaza.” His boss, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, also stressed that Palestinians must be allowed back to their homes in Gaza.
France has been full-throated in shooting down plans to displace Palestinians, with the government’s spokesperson describing such a move as a “destabilizing question in the Middle East.”

Trump repeated his view that Palestinians should be moved out of the devastated strip to “parcels” in third countries, including Jordan, despite the objections of those countries’ leaders.
And the president brushed aside questions about what authority the US might wield to take control of the Palestinian enclave.
“It’s not a complex thing to do. And with the United States being in control of that piece of land, a fairly large piece of land, you’re going to have stability in the Middle East for the first time,” Trump said in the Oval Office.
Abdullah, seated next to Trump, did not outright reject the president’s idea. But his discomfort with the plan was obvious as he indicated alternate proposals for Gaza would be forthcoming.
“I think we have to keep in mind, there is a plan from Egypt and the Arab countries,” Abdullah said. “I think the point is, how do we make this work in a way that is good for everybody?” He later advised, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”
In a statement after their meeting, Abdullah was more direct. “I reiterated Jordan’s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position. Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,” he wrote on X.
But Trump’s comments made obvious he’s serious about moving forward with the plan he revealed one week ago.
“We’re going to have it, we’re going to keep it, and we’re going to make sure that there’s going to be peace and there’s not going to be any problem, and nobody’s going to question it, and we’re going to run it very properly,” Trump said.
“We’re going to take it. We’re going to hold it. We’re going to cherish it,” Trump said of Gaza.
His plans to “own” the Strip have injected yet more uncertainty into the shaky ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.
Sitting next to Abdullah, the president held to his comments, made the day before in the Oval Office, that “all hell is going to break out” if Hamas does not release all hostages from Gaza by noon on Saturday.
“And you know, I have a Saturday deadline, and I don’t think they’re going to make the deadline personally,” Trump said.
He added that “all bets are off” in regard to the ceasefire deal if Hamas does not release the hostages by then.
Looking for a deal
A week after proposing his brazen new plan to redevelop Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” Trump appears intent on negotiating his far-fetched plan into reality.
In this case, the deal he’s envisioning would apparently involve Jordan and Egypt accepting millions of new Palestinian refugees — over their consistent objections — so Trump can clear the rubble from the demolished Gaza Strip, construct new glass towers with Mediterranean views and invite “the world’s people” to move in.
“We’re going to be able to work something, and I know we’ll be able to work something also with, I believe, not, not 100%, but 99% we’re going to work out something with Egypt,” Trump said on Tuesday.
As leverage, Trump is wielding the billions of dollars in American assistance provided to Jordan and Egypt every year, without which those countries could face dire financial problems.
“Yeah, maybe, sure why not?” Trump responded in the Oval Office on Monday evening when asked if he would hold back American aid to Jordan and Egypt. “If they don’t, I would conceivably withhold aid, yes.”
A day later, he seemed less sure that cutting aid was the best path.
“No, I think we’ll do something. I don’t have to threaten with money,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Tuesday. “I think we’re above that.”
Cairo and Amman are not without leverage of their own: Both closely align their security policies with Washington, and both have played a role in protecting Israel in the past — including last year, when Jordan helped shoot down a barrage of Iranian missiles fired toward Israel. Even some US officials worry forcing Egypt and Jordan to accept new Palestinian refugees, if that’s even possible, could seriously destabilize two reliable security partners.
“I do think he’ll take, and I think other countries will take also,” Trump said a day ahead of his meeting with Abdullah. “They have good hearts.”
The question for Abdullah, along with Egyptian officials visiting Washington this week, is whether Trump’s maximalist proposal for the troubled enclave is serious, or whether it is merely a starting point for some alternative plan to bring peace and stability to the area.
Some Trump officials have suggested the latter, even if they are careful to insist the president isn’t bluffing when discussing his audacious idea.
“Come to the table with your plan if you don’t like his plan,” Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, suggesting the White House has received “all kinds of outreach” since Trump’s comments.
At its root, US officials said, Trump’s suggestion was intended in part to spur action on an issue he has viewed as moribund, with no other nations offering reasonable solutions for how to rebuild an area that has been obliterated by Israeli bombardment following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.
Still, it is debatable whether, in Trump’s mind, there exists a distinction between serious proposal and negotiating tactic. Nothing he has said about the Gaza plan in the week since he first uttered it aloud, at a news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggests it is anything but an earnest strategy, even if statements by some of his top officials suggested otherwise.
In fact, in the days before Abdullah’s arrival, Trump did nothing to soften what has for many in the region been the most troubling aspect of his proposal: that Palestinians who leave Gaza under his plan would not be permitted to return.
“No, they wouldn’t,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News when asked whether the Palestinians would have a right to return to Gaza. “Because they will have much better housing. Much better – in other words, I’m talking about building a permanent place for them.”
Trump leaning on Jordan and Egypt
So far, Trump seems set on finding that “permanent place” in Jordan and Egypt, even though leaders in both those countries swiftly rejected the plan last week.
Egypt, which is concerned about an influx of Palestinians destabilizing its Sinai region, said on Sunday that it will convene an “emergency” Arab League summit on February 28 in Cairo to discuss “new and dangerous developments” in the Palestinian issue.
In Jordan, where a large proportion of the population is of Palestinian descent, the issue holds particular resonance. The country absorbed successive waves of Palestinian refugees, starting in 1948 during the war that led to Israel’s creation.
In 1970, armed Palestinian factions tried to seize control of the country from King Abdullah’s father Hussein, a brief but violent conflict known as “Black September.” Memories of the incident haven’t faded more than 50 years later, not least from the country’s current king, as the country grapples with a delicate demographic balance between its Palestinian and native Jordanian populations.
At a moment when popular dissatisfaction with the king is growing, the question of how to proceed could become an existential one, both for Abdullah and for his US-focused geopolitics.
A destabilized Jordan would prove deeply problematic both for the United States and Israel. Already, some opposition figures in Jordan have called for the kingdom to turn its attention away from the US and toward China, Russia or wealthy Arab states.
All that complicates Trump’s plan to move more than a million Palestinian refugees there. Yet so far, he hasn’t acknowledged those difficulties, confident instead that he will be able to negotiate some workable solution.
“I have a feeling that despite them saying no, I have a feeling that the king in Jordan and that the general — president — but that the general in Egypt will open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done,” Trump said last week, referring in the latter instance to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former military officer.
Tuesday’s meeting was not the first conversation between Trump and Abdullah about accepting more Palestinian refugees.
“I said to him, ‘I’d love for you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess,’” Trump told reporters after he spoke by phone to the Jordanian leader late last month.
At the time, Trump had not revealed publicly his new plan to take “long-term ownership” of the strip. Trump officials did not circulate his plan with Jordanian or Egyptian officials before the president announced it from the East Room.
And while Trump had been discussing his idea with aides for several days, it was not written down before it appeared in his prepared remarks alongside Netanyahu last Tuesday.
An Arab government official who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter told CNN that it’s still unclear if the US has fully worked through the details of Trump’s plan. The official said that Arab officials will discuss the matter with the Trump administration and propose ideas for Gaza’s future that would not involve expelling its Palestinian residents.
How that can be reconciled with Trump’s own idea isn’t clear.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages-health-intelligence-intl/index.html,"Israel fears for condition of remaining hostages, as intel suggests male captives treated worse than women",2025-02-11 14:32:28,"When three Israeli hostages emerged at the weekend, emaciated and gaunt after 16 months in Hamas captivity, Israelis were shocked by the images.
But inside the Israeli government, top officials were not surprised.
The Israeli government has had intelligence for months indicating that many of the remaining living hostages are in poor health, two Israeli officials tell CNN. “It wasn’t a surprise for us,” one Israeli official said.
And many of the remaining Israeli hostages are also believed to be in even worse condition, the officials said. “From this moment onward, we expect worse scenes,” a second Israeli official said.
Eli Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami were paraded by Hamas militants during a handover ceremony on Saturday, the three latest Israeli hostages to be freed by the militant group since the implementation of the ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas.
The three men appeared drastically thinner than before their release, and their relatives subsequently raised concerns about their physical and mental treatment during their captivity.
Hamas has since postponed the next hostage release scheduled to take place in Gaza on Saturday “until further notice,” accusing Israel of breaking the ceasefire deal. This has heightened fears surrounding the status and wellbeing of the dozens of Israelis still being held in the enclave.
Israel’s intelligence indicates that Hamas has been treating male hostages worse than female captives, the second official said, and there is especially heightened concern for the condition of the male soldiers held captive by Hamas.
Many male hostages have been fed less and kept in far worse conditions, the officials added, citing Israeli assessments.
Evidence supporting that intelligence has only grown in recent days, as the freed hostages and their families described elements of their captivity.
Or Levy’s brother Michael said when he saw his brother on Saturday for the first time in 16 months, he wasn’t the same person who left home on October 7, 2023.
“He came back in poor physical condition. Anyone who saw the pictures and videos couldn’t ignore it. For 16 months, he was hungry, barefoot and in constant fear that every day can be his last,” Michael said, according to the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters.
Returning hostages said that several male hostages were being held in chains and are severely malnourished.
In a heart-wrenching interview on Israel’s Channel 12, the mother of 24-year-old hostage Alon Ohel shared what she had learned about her son.
“He has shrapnel in his eye, he has shrapnel in his shoulder, he has shrapnel in his arm. Alon was bound in chains, this entire time, and he had almost no food — at most one pita a day, over a very, very, very long time, more than a year,” Idit Ohel said.
Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Ella Ben Ami said her father, Ohad, “went through hell” in Gaza and noted that the remaining Israeli hostages are suffering the same conditions her father did.
“I had many pictures in my mind of my dad, but nothing prepared me for those pictures of him on that stage in Gaza. I was sure that I would be strong, but I fell on the floor and screamed, ‘I’m sorry,’” she said.
The Israeli military meanwhile said on Tuesday that Shlomo Mantzur, who at 85 was the oldest hostage taken on October 7, was killed during the Hamas-led attack and his body has since been held in Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday they notified his family after confirmation of his death “based on intelligence gathered in recent months” and following approval by a committee of the Ministry of Health, in cooperation with the Ministry of Religious Services and the Israeli Police.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Rob Picheta']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/10/middleeast/educational-bookshop-raid-east-jerusalem-intl/index.html,East Jerusalem: Israeli police raid renowned Palestinian bookstores in occupied area,2025-02-10 10:11:29,"Israeli police raided two Palestinian bookstores in occupied east Jerusalem on Sunday, confiscating books and arresting one of the owners and his nephew, according to their family members.
CCTV footage shared by the owners, four brothers from the Muna family, shows police officers putting books in trash bags at one of the branches of the Educational Bookshop, a decades-old respected institution with Arabic- and English-language branches.
“They did throw some books on the ground but the Arabic (language) store is where the material damage was,” store owner Iyad Muna told CNN.
Photos shared by Muna of the Arabic-language store show books, notebooks and writing materials scattered on the ground.
Israeli police said in a statement Monday that two people were arrested on suspicion of “selling books containing incitement and support for terrorism.”
“The suspects who allegedly sold the books were taken into custody by police detectives,” the police spokesperson’s unit said.
An Israeli court on Monday extended the detention of the two men – Mahmoud and Ahmed Muna – by 24 hours, to be followed by five days of house arrest. Their family said Tuesday that the pair had indeed been released to house arrest.
Police had originally asked for their detention to be extended for eight days while the investigation continued.
The pair’s lawyer, Nasser Odeh, told CNN on Monday that he was “surprised” by the Israeli police’s request for an extension of the men’s detention. “During the proceedings, we legally argued that this search order was not based on solid grounds,” he said.
“We also argued that the books in question discuss Palestinian history, human rights and the suffering experienced by the Palestinian people and various communities. Moreover, we asserted that these books do not pose any threat or danger and do not support the allegations made against them,” Odeh continued.
Representatives of diplomatic missions from the European Union, several EU member states, the United Kingdom and Brazil were present in court ahead of the hearing, according to a CNN journalist present.
Israeli police said that “detectives encountered numerous books containing inciteful material with nationalist Palestinian themes” in the stores.
Among them was a children’s coloring book titled “From the River to the Sea.” The expression is politically controversial in Israel. Some Palestinians use the phrase in support of a homeland between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, but many Jews regard it as a call for Israel’s destruction.
Established in 1984 on the central Salah el Dein street, the Educational Bookshop has since expanded and has become one of the most well-known cultural institutions in East Jerusalem.
The original branch sells Arabic books, while the English-language store opened years later is frequented by Palestinians, Israelis and foreigners alike. A third shop, located inside the American Colony Hotel, is popular with diplomats, reporters and foreign dignitaries staying at the historic hotel.
The bookshop was founded by Ahmad Muna, a Jerusalemite who worked as a teacher in the Shu’fat refugee camp on the outskirts of the city. According to his son Mahmoud, who now runs the bookshop and was arrested on Sunday, Ahmad would usually spend the morning teaching and then open the shop in the afternoons and evenings.
The shop sells books about Palestinian history, the Arab-Israeli conflict and Jerusalem, as well as contemporary Palestinian fiction, art books, Palestinian cookbooks, reprints of historical maps and art prints.
The group “The Time Has Come,” which lobbies for peace between Jews and Palestinians, said the bookstore and its people “are an important part of the shared future we envision for Jerusalem. The arrest and confiscation not only harm the right to free expression and the freedom of information but also place the city’s future on the brink.”
Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur for Palestinian Territories, said she was “shocked by the raid” on the bookstores, which she called “an intellectual lighthouse and family-run gem resisting Palestinian erasure under apartheid.”
Albanese also urged the international community in Jerusalem to “show up, stand with the Muna family, and protect this vital hub.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/10/middleeast/analysis-israel-holocaust-gaza-hostages-netanyahu-intl-latam/index.html,Holocaust becomes political bludgeon as Netanyahu returns to a country at crossroads,2025-02-10 05:01:47,"As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returns from a week-long trip to Washington, toting a fantastical and radical Gaza plan from the American president, he finds a country at a crossroads.
Will Israel return to war in Gaza? Or will the ceasefire hold, and more Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners see freedom?
US President Donald Trump wants America to control Gaza and for the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there to leave. The gaunt appearance of three Israelis released from Hamas captivity has traumatized the nation. A month-old ceasefire expires in just over two weeks and talks to extend it have barely begun, if at all.
Memories and images of the Holocaust have always loomed over the Israeli psyche. But now, at a critical time in the 16-month-long Gaza war, a battle to define the lessons of that slaughter is being played out across Israeli society.
‘Holocaust survivors’
On Saturday, Israelis gathered around their televisions as they have every weekend for a month, to see their compatriots released from more than a year of captivity in Gaza.
Hamas’ highly staged handover ceremonies are fraught. Just a week ago, many Israelis got flashbacks to the scenes of October 7, 2023, as militants pushed Arbel Yehoud through a jostling crowd.
But the nation was not prepared for the image of three skeletal figures – Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy – as Hamas militants led them from a van in Deir al-Balah this weekend. Emaciated, with sunken faces, the three appeared barely able to walk on their own.
To many, the image drew immediate parallels to the survivors of Nazi death camps. “The three who returned today are Holocaust survivors,” Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is still held in Gaza, said later that day.
When the prime minister expressed outrage at their appearance, the opposition leader Yair Lapid hit back: “Netanyahu, did you just now discover that the condition of the hostages is dire?”
Hamas and its allies continue to hold 73 hostages taken on October 7, of whom at least 34 are believed to be dead by the Israeli government.
Netanyahu has long been accused, with some evidence, of deliberately blocking previous ceasefire deals. In a tell-all interview with Israel’s Channel 12 on Thursday, the former defense minister Yoav Gallant – fired by Netanyahu last year after months of tension – agreed.
“This offer from early July that Hamas agreed to is identical to the offer now, only less good in some respects,” he said of the ceasefire agreement adopted in January. “There are fewer live hostages, unfortunately. More time has passed. And we are paying a heavier price here, because there are at least 110 more murderers who will be released in this process.”
Previous hostages have been freed in relative health – albeit, doctors say, malnourished and traumatized. With the release of the three gaunt men this weekend, Hamas appeared to be sending a message at a critical moment.
“Seeing the three hostages this morning as if they had been liberated from World War II concentration camps should compel us all to accelerate the release of all hostages,” the veteran Israeli negotiator-turned-peace activist Gershon Baskin said on Saturday.
Even the US president weighed in. “They look like they’ve aged 25 years,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. “They literally look like the old pictures of Holocaust survivors. The same thing.”
It should be noted, of course, that many Palestinian prisoners who have been released from Israeli jails say that they were deliberately starved. Mohammad El-Halabi, an aid worker who was charged in 2016 with funneling money to Hamas in a case disputed by international human rights groups, was among those released earlier this month.
“The food was not even sufficient for a small child,” he told CNN. The Israel Prison Service says that “all prisoners are detained according to the law,” and that people can file complaints if they feel they have been mistreated.
‘Total victory’
Just as some see in the Holocaust an argument to accelerate a deal for more hostages, others draw on a deep strain in Israeli culture – that, no matter what, Jews will never again be victims.
“We became a nation of victims – we were the perfect victim,” Netanyahu told Fox News this weekend. “I don’t seek wars – I seek to end wars. But if a war is foisted on me, like these monsters foisted on us, we will defeat them. And we will achieve total victory over them. No question about that.”
Speaking on Holocaust Remembrance Day last year, he said that “a straight line, as sinister as can be, connects the murderers of old to the murderers of today.”
Though his foreign minister, Gideon Saar, also drew the comparison between the Holocaust and the gaunt Israeli hostages released this weekend, Netanyahu has so far avoided their comparison.
His extremist finance minister is similarly skeptical. “The suffering of our hostages in Hamas’ brutal captivity is heartbreaking,” Bezalel Smotrich said this weekend. “But comparisons to the Holocaust are a grave mistake and are based on the contempt for the Holocaust.”
His opinions carry weight. Smotrich is at the height of his powers. After Itamar Ben Gvir quit his post as national security minister over the Gaza ceasefire, Smotrich’s right-wing Religious Zionism party became the keystone to Netanyahu’s ability to govern.
He has also threatened to quit, if Israel doesn’t return to war in Gaza. It is little surprise that Netanyahu waited until this weekend – a week after a deadline for further ceasefire talks – to send a delegation to Qatar. Israeli media is rife with speculation that he is simply running out the clock until phase one of the deal expires on March 1.
“We’re going to get 75% of the living hostages out,” he told Fox News, before hastening to add: “Which – and I intend to get all of them out.”
If Netanyahu does return Israel to war in Gaza, Trump’s desire for Palestinians to leave will become unavoidable.
Trump’s plan is radical. If Palestinians were forced to leave – or encouraged, by prolonging dire humanitarian conditions – it would almost certainly constitute ethnic cleansing under international law. But Trump has recognized, in the simplistic way of a populist, that paying lip service to the two-state solution has only entrenched the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“We’re going to finish Hamas off,” Netanyahu said in that interview. “And what happens then? Do we leave the people there with all that devastation? Do you say, ‘Well, they have to stay in, confined?’ Because nobody lets them leave. Everybody describes Gaza as the biggest open-air prison in the world. You know why? Because they’re not allowed to leave.”
Never one to waste an opportunity, Ben Gvir – a far-right politician who carries a conviction of incitement to racism and supporting a terror organization – also seized on the hostages’ appearance. “This is a holocaust,” he said. “Encourage voluntary immigration now.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/09/politics/trump-gaza-real-estate/index.html,Trump describes Gaza as a ‘big real estate site’ as he doubles down on plans to redevelop the enclave,2025-02-04 00:00:00,"President Donald Trump on Sunday doubled down on his plans for the US to redevelop Gaza, saying that he viewed the war-torn enclave as a “big real estate site.”
“I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people — the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza — to go back yet another time, and we don’t want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it and we’ll slowly — very slowly, we’re in no rush — develop it. We’re going to bring stability to the Middle East soon,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled to the Super Bowl in New Orleans.
According to the United Nations, Israel’s war on Hamas has displaced 90% of Gaza residents, many of whom have been forced to move repeatedly.
Trump, a former real estate magnate, described Gaza as a “demolition site” that would be “leveled out” and “fixed up.”
He again suggested that other Middle Eastern countries would house displaced Palestinians in “beautiful sites.”
Trump first raised the proposal Tuesday during a joint press conference alongside his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu. “The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,” Trump said, later describing his vision for the area as a new “Riviera.”
Netanyahu has since described Trump’s plan as a “revolutionary, creative vision.”
Addressing a cabinet meeting on Sunday after his return from the United States, Netanyahu said the visit and discussions he had with the US president “carry with them additional tremendous achievements that can ensure Israel’s security for generations.”
Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday that Trump presented a “different vision for the ‘day after’” the conflict in Gaza.
“For a whole year, we’ve been told that in the ‘day after,’ we need the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority,” the Israeli leader said.
“President Trump came with a completely different vision, much better for the state of Israel. A revolutionary, creative vision – and we are discussing it. He is very determined to implement it. This also opens up many possibilities for us.”
But a Hamas official called Trump’s latest remarks “absurd.”
“Gaza is not a property that can be bought and sold, and it is an integral part of our occupied Palestinian land,” said Izzat Al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’ political bureau. “Dealing with the Palestinian issue with the mentality of a real estate dealer is a recipe for failure.”
Regional leaders have also rejected Trump’s plans, which break with decades of US foreign policy. His proposals are expected to be a key topic of discussion when the president hosts the king of Jordan at the White House this week.
But Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, suggested earlier Sunday that Trump was offering an initial salvo to bring other players in the region to the table to find a solution.
“Come to the table with your plan if you don’t like his plan,” Waltz said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” adding that the White House has received “all kinds of outreach” since Trump’s comments earlier this week.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/09/middleeast/netzarim-israel-gaza-ceasefire-withdrawal-intl/index.html,Israel completes withdrawal from key road dividing Gaza as part of ceasefire deal,2025-02-09 13:45:04,"Israel completed its withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor on Sunday, a militarized zone that splits Gaza in half, as part of its commitments under a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have filed through the area, many of them returning decimated homes in the north, by foot, car and in some cases, by donkeys. People traveling through the corridor must still navigate a checkpoint and the destruction wrought by 15 months of Israeli bombardment.
“I was displaced a long time ago. I have seen people arriving on this road, sometimes even sleeping on it while waiting for the Israeli army to withdraw,” said Osama Saleem, who was waiting for his vehicle to be inspected.
“I hope the Israeli army withdraws from all of Gaza and that life returns to normal,” he added.
Hamas said in a statement that Israeli forces had fully withdrawn from the corridor, a six-kilometer strip of land that separates the north of the territory from the south and stretches from the Israel-Gaza border to the Mediterranean Sea.
Named after the former Israeli settlement of Netzarim in Gaza, the corridor was constructed and occupied by the Israeli military to create a strategic, central road intersecting the enclave.
“The withdrawal of the Zionist occupation army from the Netzarim axis is a victory for the will of our people,” a Hamas statement issued Sunday said.
There has been no confirmation from Israel, but reporters working for CNN on the ground said there were no Israeli forces present at the crossing on Sunday.
Israel had used the corridor as a zone of occupation during its 15-month assault on Gaza. Its troops began withdrawing from Netzarim Corridor two weeks ago as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement.
In the first 72 hours after Israeli forces opened the corridor, around 500,000 displaced Palestinians — almost a quarter of Gaza’s population — had made the journey to the decimated north, according to the Gaza Government Media Office.
Israel retains its presence along Gaza’s borders with Egypt and Israel.
A checkpoint run by Egyptian and Qatari officials — countries that play a mediator role between the warring sides — remains at Netzarim.
Israel’s complete withdrawal from Netzarim is part of its commitment to the ceasefire and hostage agreement, which on Saturday saw the release of three Israeli hostages and 183 Palestinian prisoners.
So far, 16 out of a total of 33 hostages expected to be released in the first — and current — phase of the deal have been freed.
Separately, hours after Israel troops withdrew from the corridor, Israel forces opened fire near Nahal Oz, an Israeli kibbutz that lies close to the Gaza border - and was attacked during the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023 - killing three Palestinians, Palestinian authorities said. Others were wounded in the incident, Gaza’s Civil Defense said, without specifying how many people had been injured.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it fired warning shots towards “suspects” who had approached the border fence in northern Gaza, and that “several hits were identified,” without acknowledging whether any civilians were killed or if any actually entered the buffer zone area. Following the incident, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said: “Anyone who enters the buffer zone, their blood is on their own head — zero tolerance for anyone who threatens IDF forces or the fence area and communities.”
It comes as negotiations on the second and third phases of the ceasefire and hostages agreement are mired in uncertainty.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been deeply wary of phase two of the deal, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages there. His finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has pledged to quit the government if the ceasefire continues.
A “mid-level” Israeli delegation arrived in Doha on Sunday to discuss “technical details” of the deal but will not discuss the second phase of the agreement, an Israeli official told CNN. The delegation to Doha includes the Coordinator for Hostages and Missing Persons Brigadier General (Res.) Gal Hirsch and representatives from the Mossad intelligence agency, Shin Bet security agency, and the Israeli military. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – who returned to Israel Sunday from his trip to the United States – is expected to hold a security-political cabinet meeting about the second phase of the deal on Tuesday, the source told CNN.
Upon his return, Netanyahu convened a cabinet meeting where he spoke about his visit.
“I just returned from a historic visit to Washington with President (Donald) Trump and his senior administration officials, along with Senate and Congressional leaders. This visit and the discussions we had with the US president carry with them tremendous additional achievements that can ensure Israel’s security for generations,” Netanyahu said.
The prime minister also seemingly addressed the incident that happened across the border from Nahal Oz.
“We are enforcing the ceasefire agreements. This requires us to act with force to enforce them. We are doing this both in the south and in the north,” Netanyahu said. “My instruction this evening is – no one is to approach the perimeter, and no one is to infiltrate the perimeter.”
Netanyahu also called US President Donald Trump’s plan to take Gaza under American control a “revolutionary, creative vision.” At a joint press conference speaking alongside Netanyahu at the White House last week, Trump said the United States would take ownership of Gaza and redevelop it into a “Riviera of the Middle East.”
“For a whole year, we’ve been told that in the ‘day after,’ we need the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority,” the Israeli leader said. “President Trump came with a completely different vision, much better for the state of Israel. A revolutionary, creative vision – and we are discussing it. He is very determined to implement it. This also opens up many possibilities for us.”
Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian health authorities said Israeli forces shot and killed a woman who was eight months pregnant. Sundus Jamal Muhammad Shalabi, 23, was killed in the Nur Shams refugee camp, according to the Palestinian health ministry, who said that her husband was also shot and critically injured. CNN has approached the Israeli military for comment.
Israeli military incursions in the northern West Bank targeting the cities of Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas have severely restricted Palestinians’ access to essential services and caused widespread destruction, the United Nations said on Thursday.
The operation, which started shortly after the ceasefire in Gaza began — now includes the Nur Shams refugee camp, according to the Israeli military. In a Telegram post Sunday, the IDF said that they “began operating overnight to thwart terrorism in Nur al-Shams,” and had “targeted several terrorists and arrested additional wanted individuals in the area.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/middleeast/hostages-release-fifth-round-israel-hamas-ceasefire-intl-hnk/index.html,"Pale, gaunt Israeli hostages freed from Gaza captivity as scores of Palestinian prisoners released under ceasefire deal",2025-02-08 09:15:04,"Three male Israeli hostages and 183 Palestinian prisoners were freed in the fifth round of exchanges between Israel and Hamas Saturday, but the gaunt, frail appearance of the released hostages was condemned as “shocking” by Israel.
A group representing the families of hostages held in Gaza said it was “horrified by the visible physical and mental condition” of Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who were paraded on a makeshift stage before the handover.
The three men – all taken hostage during the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel – were handed to the Red Cross in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah on day 491 of their captivity. While the transfer was orderly – in contrast to chaotic scenes surrounding the release of Israeli and Thai hostages in Gaza last week – the three appeared thin and pale.
On stage and surrounded by Hamas militants, Ben Ami and Sharabi, who were dressed in brown, and Levy, who was dressed in green, delivered speeches in Hebrew. They were then led to three Red Cross vehicles waiting to take them back to Israel.
The Red Cross then passed the hostages to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, who transferred them back to Israel, where they underwent an initial medical assessment before being reunited with their families.
Following their transfer, Hamas also released a highly produced propaganda video showing the three men together inside a tunnel, in a departure from previous hostage releases.
Israel later released all 183 Palestinian prisoners due to be freed on Saturday, 18 of whom were serving life sentences. Many of them appeared emaciated and in poor health.
The scenes during Saturday’s hostage handover have drawn condemnation from Israel. Levy – who was released as he was considered a humanitarian case – appeared particularly frail.
The Israeli government described the scenes as “shocking” and said they “would not go unaddressed,” while Israel’s Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the freed hostages’ appearances were “disturbing.”
The Nir Oz kibbutz in southern Israel, among the hardest hit in the October 7 attacks, said it was “happy and excited” for the hostages’ return Saturday, adding: “These images and the conditions in which they returned will be etched in the memory of the world and will be eternal testimony to the failure, to all who chose to oppose the deal, to all who continue to explain why we should wait, postpone or hesitate.”
Ben Ami, 56, and Sharabi, 52, were both taken from their homes in Kibbutz Be’eri, about four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Gaza border.
Ben Ami’s wife, Raz Ben Ami, also taken captive that day, was freed during a short-lived truce in November 2023.
Sharabi’s wife and daughters were killed in the October 7 attack, according to the kibbutz. It is unclear if he knew they were killed. His brother Yossi Sharabi, who was taken captive, died in Gaza, where his body remains, according to the Israeli military.
Levy, 34, was attending the Nova music festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped. His wife, Eynav, was killed in the attack.
Conditions of hostages sparks concerns
Following his release, Levy’s mother Geula told Israel’s Channel 12 that she was sad to see the hostages “thin and pale,” but added that “slowly, slowly everything will work out.”
She added that Levy and his 3-year-old son, Almog, had reunited. “(They) met as if nothing had happened as far as Almog was concerned, as if nothing had happened. Now they are playing,” Geula Levy said.
In another interview with Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11 News, she said that Levy did not know that his wife had died. “He did not know. He assumed, and asked, and we told him,” his mother said.
Ruby and Hagit Chen, the parents of Itay Chen, a US hostage in Gaza, said “the pictures of Or, Ohad and Eli simultaneously widen and stab our hearts.”
They urged US President Donald Trump to push to include six US citizens still held by Hamas in the next phase of the hostage release deal.
The Hope (Tikva) Forum, which represents the families of some of the hostages, said Saturday it was “horrified by the visible physical and mental condition of Eli, Or, and Ohad. These images are haunting us and will not let us rest.”
“We will continue to fight and struggle until the last hostage is brought home,” the group added.
Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General António Guterres demanding that he “publicly condemn” Hamas “following the dire physical condition of the three Israeli hostages.”
Netanyahu said in a video message from Washington, DC, following the release of three Israeli hostages, that his country “will do everything to bring all our hostages back.”
The news came as Netanyahu approved sending a delegation to Doha to discuss the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. An Israeli official described the delegation to CNN on Saturday as “mid-level” and said it would “discuss technical details of the agreement.” The official said the team would not be discussing the second phase of the deal.
Hamas has now released a total of 16 Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, of a total of 33 promised at staggered intervals during this stage. Eight of those 33 are dead, according to the Israeli government.
Following the release of the three hostages on Saturday, Hamas and its allies still hold a total of 73 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023, of 251 initially taken. Three additional hostages, held captive since 2014, are still in Gaza.
Freed Palestinian prisoners united with families
Meanwhile, Israel freed 183 Palestinians Saturday. Some of the released prisoners were taken from Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank to Ramallah, where video of their release showed some detainees weak and thin, with one man appearing so frail that he needed to be carried. Recently released Palestinian prisoners have returned from Israeli detention with signs of physical abuse and starvation, and have alleged abuse and torture.
The Israeli prison system has come under fire for intentionally reducing food servings to Palestinian prisoners in what’s been described as the minimum required for survival, on the orders of then National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir last year.
In comments made in April 2024, Ben Gvir said that Palestinian prisoners “should be killed with a shot to the head,” and called for a bill to allow for executions to be passed in the Israeli Knesset. “Until then, we will give them minimal food to survive. I do not care about this,” he said. In October, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that conditions in the notorious Sde Teiman detention center must comply with Israeli law. A spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service told CNN Saturday that the IPS “operates according to the provisions of the law” and that “all basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards.”
Eighteen of the Palestinian prisoners released Saturday were serving life sentences, while 54 had lesser sentences and 111 were detained in Gaza after October 7, Hamas said in a statement. The charges against the 111 were not clear.
Palestinian militants killed more than 1,200 people during the October 7, 2023, attack. Israeli bombardment of Gaza since has killed more than 48,000 people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, reduced much of the enclave to rubble, and led to a humanitarian catastrophe for surviving residents. The war has spilled over into the wider region, putting Israel in conflict with key Hamas backer Iran, as well as Tehran proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.
Uncertainty looms over the future of the ceasefire and hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas. Negotiations on extending the Gaza ceasefire – which expires on March 1 – are in doubt.
Netanyahu has been deeply wary of phase two of that deal, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages there. His finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has pledged to quit the government if the ceasefire continues.

Speaking to reporters at the presidential palace, new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said the 24-member cabinet would prioritize financial reforms, reconstruction and the implementation of a United Nations resolution seen as a cornerstone to stability on the Lebanese border with Israel.
The announcement came after more than three weeks of talks with rival political parties in Lebanon - where government posts are parceled out according to sect - and days of deadlock over the Shi’ite Muslim ministers, usually named by Iran-backed Hezbollah and its Shi’ite ally Amal.
But Washington has pushed back against Hezbollah’s sway in any new government.
U.S. deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus said on Friday that the U.S. considered Hezbollah’s involvement in the new cabinet a “red line” and thanked Israel for dealing devastating blows to the group, in a controversial statement that sparked protests in Lebanon.
But ultimately, Hezbollah’s ally Amal - which is headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri - was allowed to choose four of the new cabinet’s members, including the finance minister Yassin Jaber, and give its nod of approval to a fifth.
The cabinet is now charged with drafting a policy statement - a broad outline of the upcoming government’s approach and priorities - and will then need a vote of confidence from Lebanon’s parliament to be fully empowered.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/middleeast/hamas-hostage-release-israel-intl/index.html,Hamas to release three Israeli men Saturday in latest round of exchanges under ceasefire deal,2025-02-07 00:00:00,"Hamas is set to release three Israeli from Gaza on Saturday, in what will be the fifth round of exchanges under the ongoing ceasefire.
Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi, and Or Levy are expected to be released on the 491st day of their captivity, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office confirmed. Scores of Palestinian prisoners are due to be released in return.
Hamas fighters have been gathering in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, for the transfer while crowds are also thronging Hostage Square in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv awaiting the release.
Ben Ami, 56, was kidnapped on October 7, 2023, from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri. His wife Raz Ben Ami was also taken captive and was freed during a ceasefire in November 2023.
Sharabi, age 52, was also taken from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri. His wife and daughters were murdered on October 7, according to the kibbutz. His brother Yossi Sharabi, who was taken captive, died in Gaza, where his body remains, according to the Israeli military.
Or Levy, age 34, was attending the Nova music festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped. His wife Eynav was murdered in the attack.
In a statement from spokesperson Michal Peikin, Kibbutz Be’eri celebrated the scheduled release of two of their residents.
“With the return of Eli and Ohad, we can breathe a sigh of relief, but it will not return to normal until all the hostages return safely to their families, and until all the murdered return for burial,” Peikin said.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum also welcomed the news about the hostages.
“We have both a sacred duty and moral right to bring all our brothers and sisters home,” the forum said.
Under the ceasefire deal agreed in Qatar last month, Hamas was to prioritize releasing women, children, the elderly, and those who are sick.
Since the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, Hamas and its allies have released 18 hostages held in Gaza – including five Thai citizens released outside the parameters of the agreement. In exchange, the Israeli government has released 583 Palestinians held in detention – some serving life sentences for serious offenses – but also a significant number of children held without public charge or trial.
Friday’s announcement came nearly three hours after it was expected, after Hamas on Friday accused the Israeli government of “continued procrastination and hesitation in implementing the humanitarian protocol of the agreement.”
In a statement, group said that “the pledges stipulated in the agreement have not been implemented in the specified manner, which exacerbates the suffering” of Palestinians in Gaza.
The United Nations says that “challenges continue in bringing into Gaza some critical humanitarian supplies,” though noted that prices have declined and the distribution of humanitarian supplies within Gaza has become easier, following the withdrawal of the Israeli military from urban areas.
Hamas said Friday that it expects Israel on Saturday to release 183 Palestinians held in prison in exchange for the three Israelis.
Eighteen of the prisoners are serving life sentences, 54 have lesser sentences, and 111 were detained in the Gaza Strip after October 7, 2023, the group said in a statement. The charges against the 111 were not clear.
Israel is yet to confirm the numbers and names of Palestinian prisoners who are expected to be released on Saturday.","['Lauren Izso', 'Kareem Khadder', 'Ivana Kottasová', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq']",en

Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
The announcement, which includes thousands of Hellfire missiles and bombs, comes days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met President Donald Trump and other top administration officials in Washington, DC. Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump at the White House in his second term.
During the standard congressional review process, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are notified of the arms sale and given time to raise concerns and ask questions. But even with questions outstanding from Meeks, the administration pushed forward with the sale.
“This move is yet another repudiation by Donald Trump of Congress’ rightful and legitimate oversight prerogative,” Meeks said in a statement Friday. “Furthermore, (Secretary of State Marco) Rubio has failed to provide adequate justification or documentation for bypassing the Congressional Committee review process.”
A congressional aide said the move from the Trump administration left them “shocked, but not surprised” that the White House fails to respect the role of Congress. The aide pointed to Trump’s rapid dismantling of USAID as another indication of the White House’s disregard for congressional oversight and authority.
The multibillion-dollar foreign military sale is the first arms sale to Israel under the Trump administration, but Israel received billions in weapons sales from the US under the previous White House.
Last summer, the Biden administration approved a massive $20 billion arms sale to Israel, which included more than 50 F-15 fighter jets.
On Tuesday, Trump falsely claimed that he ended a “de facto arms embargo” on Israel from the Biden administration. In reality, former President Joe Biden had a hold last year on one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs over concerns that their potential use by the Israeli military in Gaza endangered Palestinian civilians.
Even after the Biden administration had paused the shipment of 2,000-pound bombs, the White House was working on another $1 billion sale to Israel.
Josh Paul, who resigned from the State Department in 2023 over Biden’s Gaza policy, said circumventing the congressional review process “has essentially given the middle finger to those members and to Congressional oversight.”
“In light of President Trump’s comment just this week, in which he talked about Gaza being a hell and a demolition site, these are the weapons that made it a hell and a demolition site,” said Paul, who founded A New Policy, which advocates for changing US policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.","['Oren Liebermann', 'Natasha Bertrand']",en

Trump’s Gaza plan is ‘not serious. But that doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous,’ says former Israeli negotiator",['Adam Pourahmadi'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/06/middleeast/netanyahu-endorses-trump-gaza-plan-intl-hnk/index.html,Israel backs Trump plan and orders military to prepare for Palestinians to leave Gaza,2025-02-04 00:00:00,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has backed US President Donald Trump’s proposal to “take over” Gaza, as Israel’s army was ordered to prepare plans for large numbers of Palestinians to leave the territory.
Trump’s plan triggered an enormous backlash, with leaders from the Middle East and beyond rejecting it as unworkable and illegal.
But Netanyahu insisted the plan - which Trump said would involve sending Gaza’s residents to neighboring countries and taking “long-term ownership” of the enclave - was a “remarkable idea.”
“The actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave to leave, I mean, what is wrong with that?” he told Fox News Wednesday, adding that those who leave the strip “can come back.”
“This is the first good idea that I’ve heard. It’s a remarkable idea and I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued, and done because I think it will create a different future for everyone,” added Netanyahu.
Trump announced his proposal in a joint news conference at the White House with Netanyahu on Tuesday, setting off a maelstrom of criticism from rights groups who say the plan’s implementation would break international law – and would amount to ethnic cleansing in Gaza.
Western allies of Washington rejected the idea of displacing people from Gaza, while leaders in the Middle East, including Gazan officials, reaffirmed their position advocating for Palestinian statehood.
Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said Wednesday that Arab nations were planning to reconstruct Gaza while Palestinians remain in the enclave. Meanwhile, Jordan’s King Abdullah left for a visit to the United Kingdom and the US, with his country having announced it firmly opposes the plan.
Much of Gaza has been obliterated by 15 months of Israeli bombardment following Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attacks.
The proposal raises the question of whether Palestinians could forcefully be removed from their home, and breaks with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
White House officials have also attempted to walk back many of the details, after critics pointed out that Trump’s plan could set US troops once again into the heart of a war in the Middle East.
Some Republican lawmakers attempted to make sense of the comments in a closed-door meeting with Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Wednesday. One lawmaker in the room told CNN there was “a lot of consternation.”
At one point, Senator Roger Wicker asked if the plan had been in the works for awhile. Witkoff, the sources said, suggested it had. Although as CNN has reported, others in the administration were not aware of the plan before it was announced.
On Thursday, Trump returned to the idea, writing on his Truth Social network that Gaza “would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting” in the territory and that no US soldiers would be needed. He gave no further details on how the plan would work.
‘Voluntary departure’
On Thursday, Defense Minister Israel Katz directed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to prepare a plan “to enable the voluntary departure of Gaza residents,” according to a Defense Ministry statement.
“I welcome the bold initiative of US President Trump, which could allow a large portion of Gaza’s population to relocate to various destinations worldwide,” a statement read.
Katz said Trump’s plan “will take many years,” during which Palestinians would be integrated “into host countries while facilitating long-term reconstruction efforts in a demilitarized and threat-free Gaza in a post-Hamas era.”
The Israeli minister said countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway – who have all accused Israel of breaking international law during its military campaign in Gaza – are “legally obligated to accept any Gazan resident who wishes to enter their territory.”
Trump’s plan flies in the face of the aspirations of Palestinians, who have long advocated for statehood and roundly dismissed Trump’s relocation proposal when he first floated it two weeks ago.
Most of the two million people living in Gaza won’t want to leave, analysts have said, raising the question of whether they could be forcefully removed – which is prohibited under international law.
“This is our land, and we are the honest and true owners,” Amir Karaja, a resident of northern Gaza told CNN on Wednesday. “I won’t be displaced. Not (Trump) nor anyone else can uproot us from Gaza.”
There are about 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of people who fled with the creation of Israel in 1948. Approximately 90% of Gaza residents were displaced in the latest war, and many have been forced to move repeatedly, some more than 10 times, according to the UN.
It’s also not clear how exactly Trump’s proposed land grab would work, and analysts have cast doubt on the feasibility of his plan.
In his interview with Fox, Netanyahu said his government remained committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capabilities in Gaza.
“We have decimated most of Hamas’ military power, not all,” he said, adding “we’ll make sure it is not there when this war ends.”
Despite Israel’s 15-month war against Hamas which has eliminated many of the group’s senior leaders, flattened Gaza and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, the militant group has remained resilient.
Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said recently that each time Israel has completed military operations in Gaza and pulled back, Hamas militants regroup and re-emerge.
“We assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost. That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war,” he said.
Negotiations on extending the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal – which expires on March 1 – are in doubt with considerable uncertainty about what the next stage of the fragile truce will look like.
Netanyahu said his government remained committed to releasing all remaining hostages in Gaza.
But the Israeli prime minister has been deeply wary of phase two of that deal, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages there. His finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has pledged to quit the government if the ceasefire continues.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/05/middleeast/analysis-trump-gaza-arab-allies-intl-latam/index.html,Why Trump’s Gaza plan spells trouble for his Arab allies,2025-02-05 18:56:43,"“Mad” is how one Middle East source reacted to US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “takeover” of Gaza. So why would someone well versed in Trumpian tactics and the nuance of Middle East diplomacy give such an undiplomatic assessment?
Simply put, the US president’s apparent policy flip on Gaza – in the views of most Middle East leaders – is in no one’s best interests. Not theirs, not the Palestinians’ – not even Trump’s.
On the worst interpretation, Trump’s radical departure from decades of US foreign policy of supporting the potential establishment of a Palestinian state, that includes Gaza, signals what so many in the Middle East feared, that Israel’s war on Hamas since the group’s October 7, 2023, attack was a front to force Gaza’s 2.1 million Palestinians from their homes permanently.
Saudi Arabia, which as the region’s dominant diplomatic center, as well as spiritual home to the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims – many of whom are enraged by Israel’s actions – has perhaps the most skin in the game. And it was first to respond, within hours.
“The foreign ministry affirms that Saudi Arabia’s position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering,” the ministry said in a statement. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) “clearly and unequivocally reaffirmed this stance,” it added.
To understand all this, try to think like MBS. He is the ultimate power in his land and brooks no political dissent. Yet, Hamas, which doesn’t exist in Saudi Arabia, is an existential threat to him. It represents political Islam, an anathema for every Muslim autocrat which, given the chance would topple MBS and his fellow Gulf royals in a heartbeat. So he has a vested interest in Hamas’ obliteration.
On the flip side, Israel’s bone-smashing, concrete-crushing war in Gaza has re-awoken Saudi citizens’ dormant pro-Palestinian sentiment. A mindful MBS knows there’d be popular anger if Gazans were expelled.
Does MBS cherish peace in the Middle East, including normalization with Israel? Yes. It’s good for business, fattens his outsized bank balance, and the trickledown keeps his citizens happy.
But what’s also good for his bank balance, beyond oil priced above $80 a barrel, is US investment.
This helps to explain why MBS has not openly and directly criticized Trump’s new Gaza thinking, aside from restating the need for a Palestinian state because he doesn’t want to sour their great relationship.
He’s Trump’s go-to guy in the Gulf. He wants deals with Trump on security and weapons. Trump wants MBS’s investments in the US and for him to normalize relations with Israel.
And that circles back to another of MBS’s headaches, as custodian of Islam’s two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, he’s on the hook to be seen to be doing the right thing by the Palestinians.
Jordan and Egypt’s dilemma
By comparison the two countries named by Trump to receive Gazans, Jordan and Egypt, are really between a rock and hard place.
They depend on US money to exist.
Both had a massive influx of Gazans during Israel’s 1948 and 1967 wars, absorbing millions of frustrated Palestinians. Both now say a massive influx of Gazans would further destabilize them.
The regional view until now has been to push back hard on the looming Trumpian pressure. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi says a displacement of Gazans “can never be tolerated or allowed because of its impact on Egyptian national security.”
Jordan’s King Abdullah meanwhile insists we “need to ensure Palestinians remain on their land,” with regional diplomats pointing to the joy of Gazans going home to piles of rubble. That’s because it’s their home, they say.
The Jordanian king, who comes from a durable dynasty devoted to staying on the right side of America, is due in Washington D.C. later this month, and Egypt’s President Sisi, who Trump once described as his “favorite dictator” is expected to visit soon too.
To fully understand what’s at stake, remember that Egypt’s Sisi locked up Hamas’ progenitor, the Muslim Brotherhood, a decade ago – soon after it won elections.
Egypt is a regional lynchpin containing a potential powder keg of radical sentiment that if detonated would ricochet around the region, puncturing European and US interests. This is why Sisi is still in power and why the West turned a blind eye to his brutal post-Arab Spring power grab. The West, and particularly the United States, need Sisi as they do King Abdullah.
A failed Jordan would leave a major power vacuum, effectively opening the door to Iran’s regional proxies, putting them right at Israel’s border.
When he was speaking to the US Congress last summer, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his fight against Hamas had to be successful, otherwise “the ability of all democracies to fight terrorism will be imperiled.”
That is perhaps, even by Netanyahu’s standards, a little hyperbolic, with Trump’s pronouncement seeming to fly in the face of that logic: Hamas if expelled would still be in striking distance of Israel.
Trump also seems to have challenged another of Netanyahu’s commitments. In July the Israeli prime minister said: “My vision for that day is of a demilitarized and deradicalized Gaza. Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza.” That’s not what Trump is saying now.
And only a few months earlier Netanyahu had lauded another vision for Gaza, to turn it into a massive free-trade zone with a rail link to Saudi Arabia’s futuristic dream city, Neom.
Here is an idea that neatly dovetails with MBS’s hopes for peace in the Middle East, but one that is equally impossible without normalization – and an independent Palestinian state.
It’s unclear if the US president has trumped Netanyahu’s vision or is playing some part in forcing it through. Whatever Trump’s tough-talking intent is, by undercurrent or opportunism, he has made the previously unthinkable part of the mainstream conversation. A forced expulsion on a scale not witnessed in decades. And one that would be a war crime.",['Nic Robertson'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/05/middleeast/palestinians-refuse-trump-suggestion-gaza-intl/index.html,Palestinians refuse to relive 1948 as Trump suggests leaving Gaza,2025-02-05 15:37:15,"Life in northern Gaza is desperate – there is no water, no electricity and so much rubble that there’s barely enough space to put up tents.
Yet more than half a million Palestinians have returned to the area over the past week, according to the government there. Most are determined to stay and rebuild – even if US President Donald Trump wants them out of the enclave so he can create a Middle Eastern “riviera.”
“I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza,” Trump said during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. “Why would they want to return? The place has been hell,” he added. It was the second time in just over a week that Trump said Palestinians should leave Gaza.
His suggestion has sparked criticism across the world – and was met with disbelief and outrage among Gazans.
Amir Karaja told CNN he would “rather eat the rubble” than be forced to leave his homeland.
“We are steadfast here,” Karaja told CNN on Wednesday, as he was working on what remained of his home in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. The building resembles a doll house after the entire front wall collapsed and exposed the insides of the damaged interior.
“This is our land, and we are the honest and true owners of the land. I won’t be displaced. Not (Trump) nor anyone else can uproot us from Gaza,” Karaja said.
Standing in the middle of her heavily damaged home nearby, Iyam Jahjouh told CNN she also won’t consider moving.
“We will not leave our land or homes, despite the great destruction and everything that happened in Gaza, we are here and will remain here,” she said.
The roof and several walls of her modest home have been demolished, leaving Jahjouh with just one room covered with a makeshift roof. Yet in this neighborhood, this house is among the least destroyed.
“Why should I leave my country? You want to send me to Egypt or Jordan? No, we won’t accept it, we will put up a tent and whatever you do, we will not leave our country. We don’t give a damn about Trump’s threats or Netanyahu’s threats,” she said.
Some 70% of Gaza’s 2.1 million residents are already registered by the United Nations as refugees, many of whom are descendants of Palestinians who were displaced in 1948, when some 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or forced to flee their homes during Israel’s creation. They have been barred from returning to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Arabs refer to the event as the “Nakba” (catastrophe).
The determination to not have that dispossession repeated, no matter the current hardships, was common among the dozens of people CNN spoke to across Gaza on Wednesday and over the past week.
Selling vegetables at a market in Khan Younis, a city that has been heavily damaged by Israeli bombardment, Ahmad Safi said it was “impossible” to transfer people out of Gaza.
“We lived under bombardment for a year and a half. After all this suffering, starvation, bombardment and death, we won’t easily leave Gaza,” he said. “We prefer Gaza’s hell than the paradise of any other country… if we are given all the money of the world we won’t leave this land.”
Awatef Abu Sitta expressed similar sentiments to CNN: “All of our children’s homes have been demolished and our house is half destroyed. Rain comes into the house, cold is coming in, and we will stay whatever happens, even if we stay in the tent, even if they give us castles and villas, we are not leaving our lands.”
Many people across Gaza have been returning to whatever remains of their homes after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel came into effect last month.
The Gaza Government Media Office said that some 500,000 displaced Palestinians — almost a quarter of the enclave’s population — had made a journey back to the decimated north in the first 72 hours after Israeli forces began allowing their return last Monday.
Refusing a repeat of the Nakba
Many have celebrated their return home with joy, despite the widespread destruction.
Saleh Al-Sawalha, from Jabalya in northern Gaza, told CNN Palestinians are people who refuse to give up.
“I’ve been displaced 12 times,” he told CNN last week while waiting to make the journey up north. “We’d go to one place, they (Israelis) would tell us it’s going to get shelled. We’d go to another; they say it’s going to get shelled. We were moving from one place to another. We are so, so exhausted. There is nothing like being back in your home. That’s all we want.”
“I will not leave,” he said, in response to the US president’s comments. “Please send this message to Trump: that is the last thought that would cross our mind.”
During the Nakba, many Palestinians were led to believe that their displacement was temporary and that they would be allowed to return home once the war was over. But that never happened.
Speaking last month, Trump suggested that both Jordan and Egypt should house Palestinians from Gaza, saying potential housing “could be temporary” or “could be long term.”
On Tuesday, he said that some Palestinians could return to Gaza in the future. He envisioned “the world’s people living” in what he said would be “an international, unbelievable place.” Asked if Palestinians would be living in Gaza, he said: “Palestinians also. Palestinians will live there. Many people will live there.”
Awni Al Wadia, who was forced to flee his home in northern Gaza last year, said that the collective memory of the events of 1948 is one reason why he won’t leave the enclave.
“These comments have been made in the past. In 1967 (the Arab-Israeli war), when they displaced Palestinians, they said it was temporary, only until the situation calms down. And until now, they haven’t returned. They remained displaced,” he told CNN.
Like tens of thousands of others, Al Wadia rushed to return to northern Gaza as soon as it became possible.","['Tareq Al Hilou', 'Mohammad Al-Sawalhi', 'Kareem Khaddar', 'Abeer Salman', 'Ivana Kottasová']",en

Trump’s shocking comments break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, as well as the president’s past wariness over US intervention in the Middle East.
Here is what we know about Trump’s vision for Gaza – which is home to some two million Palestinians – including just how feasible such a proposal even is.
Trump said the US will ‘take over’ and ‘own’ Gaza long-term
“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,” Trump said, unveiling what he called his “long-term ownership” and redevelopment plan for the enclave, much of which has been reduced to rubble after 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.
Israeli airstrikes have damaged or destroyed around 60% of buildings, including schools and hospitals, and around 92% of homes, according to the United Nations.
“We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings,” Trump said Tuesday.
Trump did not rule out sending in US troops, saying “as far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary.”
It’s not clear how exactly Trump’s proposed land grab would work, and analysts have cast doubt on the feasibility of his plan.
“There is no mechanism for this. There is no precedent for this,” former deputy national intelligence director Beth Sanner, who served under both Trump and Biden administrations, told CNN’s John Berman on Tuesday.
Most of the two million people living in Gaza won’t want to leave, Sanner said, raising the question of whether they could be forcefully removed – which is prohibited under international law.
“That means that somebody, maybe the United States,” would have to step in – because “no Arab army is going to be carting people against their will out of their homeland,” Sanner said.
Trump’s vision for Gaza has no buy in from Palestinians
Trump’s plan flies in the face of the aspirations of Palestinians, who have long advocated for statehood and roundly dismissed Trump’s relocation proposal when he first floated it two weeks ago.
There are already about 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of people who fled with the creation of Israel in 1948. Half of Gaza’s population were already refugees from outside the coastal strip. Approximately 90% of Gaza residents were displaced in the latest war, and many have been forced to move repeatedly, some more than 10 times, according to the UN.
Trump rejected the idea that displaced Palestinians would want to return to Gaza, describing it as a “symbol of death and destruction.”
“Why would they want to return? The place has been hell,” Trump said, ignoring a reporter who cried out: “Because it’s their home.”
Instead of Gaza, Trump suggested the Palestinians be provided a “good, fresh, beautiful piece of land” to live.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians walked for hours to return to their bombed-out homes in Gaza after a ceasefire came into force in late January.
“We have been waiting for this day for so long,” Nadia Qassem, from Al-Shati Refugee Camp, told CNN at the time. “We want to return home… Even though my house is destroyed. I miss my land and my place.”
A Hamas official called Trump’s plan a “recipe for creating chaos.”
“Our people in the Gaza Strip will not allow these plans to pass, and what is required is to end the occupation and aggression against our people, not expel them from their land,” spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri said late Tuesday local time.
When asked whether he supports Israel’s claim to the occupied West Bank, which is home to more than three million Palestinians and coveted by far-right hardliners in Israel, Trump said “we haven’t taken a position on it yet” but said an announcement would be coming soon.
A shift would not be unprecedented. During his first term, Trump broke with decades of US foreign policy by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights. He also recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moving the US Embassy there.
Trump views Gaza as a real estate opportunity
The Israeli Palestinian conflict has been one of the Middle East’s most intractable problems. But Trump has portrayed it as a business opportunity.
The “potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable” and that it could become the “Riviera of the Middle East,” the real-estate investor turned president said.
“We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. And I don’t want to be cute, I don’t want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something that could be so — this could be so magnificent,” Trump told reporters.
Asked who he envisions living in Gaza, Trump said, “I envision the world people living there. The world’s people. I think you’ll make that into an international, unbelievable place,” positing that some Palestinians might live there one day.
The president also said he plans to visit Gaza soon.
Last month, Trump praised Gaza as having a “phenomenal location, on the sea” and “the best weather,” echoing remarks made in 2024 by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who called the waterfront property in Gaza “very valuable.”
Trump’s Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is also a real estate developer. Witkoff traveled to Gaza last week, becoming the first high-ranking US official known to visit the strip in years.
Trump’s proposal is welcome news for Israel’s far right
Israel’s far-right has long endorsed the idea of expelling Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank, and lawmakers welcomed Trump’s comments about taking over the strip.
Jewish Power party leader Itamar Ben Gvir, who resigned as national security minister last month in protest over the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, urged Netanyahu to adopt Trump’s plan in a statement to X Wednesday.
“Now it is clear: this is the only solution to the Gaza problem — this is the strategy for the ‘day after,’” he said.
While Israel’s government has previously rejected claims that it plans to force Palestinians out of Gaza, Netanyahu expressed support for Trump’s vision.
Pointing to Israel’s war objective of making sure Gaza does not pose a threat to it, Netanyahu said, “President Trump is taking it to a much higher level. He sees a different future for that piece of land that has been the focus of so much terrorism.”
The Israeli leader said Trump’s idea could “change history” and that it is “worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.”
Trump claimed his plan has broad support – but Arab nations say it’s a non-starter
Trump told reporters that “everybody (he’s) spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land” and that he hoped Jordan and Egypt would take in forced out Palestinians.
But Arab nations have long rejected any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, which critics have argued would amount to ethnic cleansing.
In a statement Wednesday following Trump and Netanyahu’s news conference, Saudi Arabia affirmed its “unwavering” support for a Palestinian state and demanded an end to Israeli occupation.
“Achieving lasting and just peace is impossible without the Palestinian people obtaining their legitimate rights in accordance with international resolutions, as has been previously clarified to both the former and current US administrations,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement to social media.
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab allies issued a statement last week reaffirming their long-held desire for a two-state solution and pledging their “continued full support for the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on their land.”
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle aren’t thrilled with the idea – at least for now
Trump’s remarks drew criticism and skepticism from lawmakers, including some Republicans.
South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called it an “interesting proposal” but also “problematic.”
“We’ll see what our Arab friends say about that. I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza. I think that might be problematic. But I’ll keep an open mind,” he said.
North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said that “there are probably a couple of kinks in that Slinky, but I’ll have to take a look at the statement.”
New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democratic on the Foreign Relations Committee, said the idea “fails to recognize the need to have a Palestinian state, and the fact that until we address the concerns of the Palestinians, there will continue to be conflict in the region.”
Sen. Chris Coons, another key Democratic member of the committee, said Trump’s plan is “between offensive and insane and dangerous and foolish.”",['Lex Harvey'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/05/politics/trump-gaza-takeover-analysis/index.html,Trump’s Gaza ‘Riviera’ plan is the most outlandish idea in the history of US Middle East peacemaking,2025-02-05 05:00:46,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu couldn’t keep the smirk off his face.
And no wonder.
Netanyahu looked on in the White House on Tuesday as President Donald Trump delivered the most stunning US intervention in the long history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The president repeatedly doubled down on his suggestion that nearly 2 million Palestinians should be relocated from battle-leveled Gaza to new homes elsewhere so that the US could send troops to the Strip, take ownership and build the “Riviera of the Middle East.”
“You build really good quality housing, like a beautiful town, like some place where they can live and not die, because Gaza is a guarantee that they’re going to end up dying,” Trump told reporters.
In a few words, Trump conjured up a mind-boggling geopolitical transformation of the Middle East and a political lifeline for Netanyahu – showing why the prime minister, despite their past tensions, was rooting for his host’s return to power in the 2024 election.
Netanyahu can now bill himself to right-wing factions in his coalition, which incessantly threaten his grip on power, as the unique and vital conduit to Trump. The American president’s views now parallel Israeli hardliners’ desire to see Palestinians ousted from part of what they view as the sacred land of Israel.
Israel’s far-right former national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s war cabinet earlier this year to protest the Gaza ceasefire deal, confirmed the synergy between Trump’s thinking and extreme conservatives in Israel.
“Donald, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship,” he wrote in a post on X.
A stunning moment
Trump’s comments – delivered throughout the day, first at an executive action signing ceremony, and later alongside Netanyahu in the Oval Office and at a joint news conference – were a landmark moment in the history of US peacemaking in the Middle East.
To see an American president endorse what would be the forcible expulsion of Palestinians from their home, in an exodus that would subvert decades of US policy, international law and basic humanity, was breathtaking.
Trump followed up with the most imperialist reflex yet of a second term in which he’s already threatened to annex the Panama Canal, Greenland and Canada. He envisaged a real estate deal whereby he’d assume responsibility for Gaza and mastermind a job-creating urban regeneration project. He called it an American “ownership position.” A better phrase would be colonialism for the 21st century.
“The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,” Trump said. “We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site. Level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area, do a real job, do something different.”
The idea resembles a scheme proposed by Trump’s investor son-in-law Jared Kushner last year to move the Palestinians out of Gaza and to “clean it up” to develop the territory’s “very valuable” Mediterranean waterfront.
But it appears absurd for multiple reasons.
If the leader of the world’s most powerful democracy led such a forced relocation, he’d mirror crimes of past tyrants and create an excuse for every autocrat to launch mass ethnic cleansing programs against vulnerable minorities.
His brainwave, however, is on brand for a second Trump term that has seen the president utterly unconstrained by the law, the Constitution or anyone around him stopping him from doing exactly as he wants.
And in all of Trump’s recent public pronouncements on Gaza, there’s an important missing element — any sense that the Palestinian people would have a choice in their own destiny. Their connection with the desecrated enclave was recently underscored by the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to Northern Gaza. Many made makeshift shelters in the ruins of their homes destroyed in Israeli’s onslaught against Hamas after the October 7, 2023, terror attacks in Israel.
The president’s obliviousness to the aspirations of Palestinians and his assumption that they’d prefer a modern housing development elsewhere showed a stunning naivety about the causes of the conflict. But it was reflected in an interaction in the Oval Office when he asked, “Why would they want to return? The place has been hell.” A reporter replied: “But it’s their home, sir. Why would they leave?”
An Arab official told CNN’s Alex Marquardt that Trump’s remarks could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. “It is essential to recognize the profound implications such proposals have on the lives and dignity of the Palestinian people, as well as the broader Middle East,” the diplomat said.
A regional no-go
There are also practical reasons why this idea is a fantasy. It is vehemently opposed by the Arab states whose money and land would be needed to make it work. Jordan, which is already home to large numbers of Palestinian refugees, fears the Hashemite Kingdom would be fatally destabilized by a new influx. Egypt’s military fears a massive influx of Palestinians that could include Hamas sympathizers of the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.
Speaking of the two Israeli neighbors, Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, said on CNN: “It’s not a real estate deal for them, it’s not even a humanitarian issue for them. It’s an existential issue.”
The idea of forcibly relocating the Palestinians would also be politically impossible for Saudi Arabia, the key piece in Trump’s plan to create an anti-Iran crescent capped by a diplomatic normalization with Israel. The kingdom has made an independent Palestinian state a condition of such a deal.
The total evacuation of Gaza would deal a serious blow to statehood dreams and create a precedent that could also raise doubt about the Palestinian presence in the West Bank – which is considered by the United Nations, like Gaza, as Israeli-occupied territory.
The idea of large numbers of Palestinians agreeing to quit Gaza for a suburban idyll elsewhere also relies on a superficial understanding of a conflict that left them dispossessed. Ever since the founding of Israel in 1948, the hopes of a return for thousands of Palestinians living in poverty in refugee camps, in places like Beirut and Jordan, have proven futile. Thus, Gazans would never leave based on promises that one day they might get back.
The idea that Trump would even broach such a scheme is an indication of how the post-October 7 era has shaken up the strategic picture in the Middle East. But it also displays remarkable hubris since recent attempts by the United States to reshape the geopolitics of the Middle East — from Iraq to Libya — ended disastrously. And across a wider historic span, efforts by European colonial powers like Britain and France to draw borders and impose grand schemes on the Middle East bequeathed generations of bitter conflicts that still rage.
Is Trump for real?
Trump’s comments will unleash yet another round of speculation about whether he’s serious about an outlandish plan, or whether he’s using it to distract from some other even more nefarious scheme — perhaps the broadening effort by his friend Elon Musk to destroy the US government from inside.
But it’s also characteristic of an outsider president who lives to shake things up and who is beloved by his voters for rejecting the orthodoxy of elites and the conventional approaches that have failed.
Establishment and media critics often bristle at his out-of-the-box ideas because they don’t fit their frame of reference. And if only Gaza could somehow be lifted clear of the generations of bloody history, symbolism, loss and wars that have raged over the enclave.
That, of course, is impossible.
So is Trump for real — or is this just another pipe dream of a president who often seems divorced from reality?
Trump’s plan was greeted with huge skepticism by Republican senators. And Democratic Sen. Chris Coons put his face in his hand and rubbed his temples. “I’m speechless. That’s insane,” the man from Delaware said.
In his own way, Trump does seem sincere about improving the lives of Gazans, even if his preferred remedy insults their identity. He said: “The people that have been absolutely destroyed that live there now can live in peace, in a much better situation, because they’re living in hell, and those people will now be able to live in peace. We’ll make sure that it’s done world class.”
He told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins at the news conference that Palestinians had tried to live in Gaza “for decades and decades and decades. It’s not going to work. It didn’t work. It will never work. And you have to learn from history.” (Most of those decades were spent either under Israeli occupation or blockade, most recently with Gaza run by Hamas, a terror group that disputes Israel’s right to exist).
Trump’s words often need several pinches of salt.
Like a former New York real estate shark, he adopts an outlandish initial position to put interlocutors off balance or as an opening bid that raises the value of a compromise position. He’s always in search of a deal — and sees conflicts like the ones in the Middle East and Ukraine through a developer’s lens.
Beth Sanner, a former senior intelligence official who conducted Trump’s daily intelligence briefing during his first term, said Tuesday’s staggering developments were a reminder that Trump “doesn’t think like a typical foreign policy establishment person.”
That may not be all bad, given the questionable outcomes of US foreign policy in recent times. But Trump is also courting risk. His comments on Tuesday will cause shockwaves throughout the Middle East and make it much harder for Arab governments to work with him to expand the Abraham Accords of his first term.
“It runs counter to the Muslim Street in the region,” Sanner said. “That’s sometimes different to what leaders think. But the leaders in the region are afraid of the Muslim Street.”
The possibility that Trump would send troops to the region also conflicts with the political DNA of a president who partly owes his rise to a political base wearied by sending its sons and daughters to war in the post-9/11 era.
But while his proposal, which would perhaps be the world’s largest ever real estate development deal, is unlikely to ever happen, it’s quintessential Trump.
“You say things others refuse to say,” Netanyahu said. “And after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, ‘You know, he’s right.’”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/middleeast/israel-gaza-habiba-medical-evacuation-jordan-intl/index.html,Toddler who has just days to live evacuated from Gaza for urgent medical care,2025-02-03 00:00:00,"A Palestinian toddler forced to wait weeks for permission to leave Gaza for life saving medical treatment has finally arrived in Jordan. The girl is now in hospital receiving critical medical treatment.
Two-year-old Habiba al-Askari left the besieged Palestinian enclave after a mammoth effort at the “highest level” in Amman, a Jordanian official familiar with the negotiations told CNN. Jordan decided to evacuate her following a CNN report on her story.
Israel initially approved Habiba’s treatment abroad last month, before it denied authorization for medical evacuations for more than two weeks, according to international aid groups.
Doctors believe Habiba has protein C deficiency – a rare but highly treatable genetic condition, which causes excessive blood clotting – and warned that the child will likely lose her right leg and possibly arms.
But thousands of children like Habiba cannot access life-saving care in Gaza, where more than 15 months of Israel’s siege and bombardment has paralyzed the medical system.
Following a CNN report on Habiba last month, Jordan decided to evacuate her to Amman for urgent medical treatment. Israel then delayed the mission, Jordanian officials told CNN last week. Israeli authorities did not respond to CNN’s repeated requests for comment at the time.
On Thursday, Habiba was admitted into intensive care in Gaza’s Nasser Hospital with a lung infection. Her heart stopped twice, according to her mother and health workers who resuscitated her. On Sunday, Israel further delayed clearing the evacuation – postponing the urgent mission and refusing to allow her mother Rana to accompany her daughter.
In CNN video from the hospital over the weekend, Rana, 37, sobbed and embraced her daughter at her bedside. In one scene, Habiba, who is too young to understand her mother’s pain, leaned over and kissed her mother on the cheeks.
“Oh Lord I pray to you for a miracle, but if this is your will, I will accept it,” Rana cried before collapsing to the floor. Habiba, sitting up in her bed, stared quietly at the nurses who rushed to pick up her mother.
Jordanian officials worked behind the scenes to obtain Israeli approval for Rana to escort Habiba and the girl’s brother Soheib.
To spare Habiba a long and perilous journey, Jordan had requested an airlift by its military from the Israel-Gaza border, but Israel denied that request, according to a senior Jordanian official, who told CNN Israeli authorities would only approve a land movement.
On Sunday, Israel then authorized Soheib’s journey – before revoking its permission at the last minute, according to Jordanian officials. The official told CNN that they finally obtained approval for the whole family to leave Gaza early Monday.
The senior official described the mission to evacuate Habiba as unnecessarily difficult. “We worked relentlessly, daily, to get Habiba out. It was followed at the highest levels in Jordan,” the official said.
COGAT, the Israeli aid agency, told CNN on Monday: “Israel has approved Habiba Mahmoud Abd al-Nasser Askari’s departure to Jordan for medical treatment, accompanied by her mother and her 10-year-old brother.”
Approvals for the departure of children and their family members for medical treatment were “subject to a security review by relevant authorities before their entry into Israel’s sovereign territory,” COGAT said on January 14.
Israel’s military campaign since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks has erased entire families, spawned starvation and disease, and decimated medical infrastructure in Gaza. After a fragile ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas materialized on January 19, Palestinians say they are struggling to reconcile the psychological trauma and physical destruction wrought by more than a year of war.
‘The stakes are a child’s life’
On Monday, the toddler and her family were first transferred in an ambulance by Gaza’s health ministry to the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel and handed over to a Jordanian medical team.
Habiba was then taken through Israel and into Jordan via the King Hussein Bridge, also known as the Allenby Bridge crossing, where a medical team dispatched at the order of King Abdullah II was waiting in a helicopter to take her to a hospital in Amman.
A CNN team on the ground at the Jordanian side of the border heard sirens and saw blue and red ambulance lights illuminating a path leading to the helicopter. Three military medics met Rana and her two children inside the emergency vehicle Monday evening before the family were transferred into the chopper. The toddler lay swaddled in a blanket with a red fluffy toy as Rana gazed out the window, her eyes weary with exhaustion after her first time leaving Gaza.
Military medics monitored Habiba’s oxygen levels throughout the ten-minute flight to Amman before they arrived at the Queen Rania Al Abdullah Hospital for Children. Habiba was then seen to by medical workers at the facility. Habiba lay in bed and beamed up at her older brother.
COGAT previously told CNN that it has enabled 24 medical evacuations from Gaza through Israel to other countries “in recent months,” for 1,075 Gaza residents seeking medical care. Between 12,000 to 14,000 people still require medical evacuation from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization.
At least 37 patients and 39 companions left Gaza from Rafah, WHO said on Saturday, after the crossing re-opened.
Like Habiba, 2,500 other children in Gaza require urgent medical evacuation, according to the UN. But for those waiting for a lifeline, there is no such promise, according to a humanitarian worker in the region.
Arwa Damon, the founder of the relief organization INARA, told CNN that Israel’s process for facilitating children’s medical evacuations from Gaza is “never clear.” INARA was not involved in Habiba’s evacuation mission.
“It’s like trying to navigate a twisted reality TV show… where the rules for survival are… constantly shifting and the stakes are a child’s life,” Damon said Monday. “What we have faced trying to get Habiba out is not unique to her, it’s the status quo.”","['Abeer Salman', 'Jomana Karadsheh', 'Tareq Al Hilou']",en

“What has been happening in Jenin city and the refugee camp over the past two weeks is similar to that of Gaza but on a smaller scale,” Mohammad Jarrar said Monday.
Hundreds of residential units make up the 120 destroyed buildings, he said, noting that the destruction had impacted thousands of families.
Jarrar described scenes of devastation amid a shortage of food, water and medication as services have been disrupted because of the operation. He added that displacement is expected to only further increase.
Israel launched its operation two days after the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire began, dubbing it “Operation Iron Wall.”
The Israeli military said the operation was aimed at eliminating “terrorists and terror infrastructure” and “ensuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over – the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza.”
More than 40 Palestinians have been killed across the West Bank by the Israeli military since the operation was launched, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which said that 25 of those people were from Jenin. Dozens more have been injured, the ministry said.
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right nationalist who opposes the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, said in a January statement that security in the West Bank had been added to the country’s “war goals.”
Smotrich publicly toyed with quitting the Israeli government when the Gaza ceasefire was announced, but decided to stay in the cabinet after saying he had received assurances from Netanyahu on his commitment to continue Israel’s military operations in the West Bank and Gaza.
Jarrar told CNN that the military operation on Jenin was “political,” noting the desire of some in Israeli government to annex the West Bank and encourage Palestinians to emigrate from the territory.
The mayor said that schools might be opened to take in displaced people, as was seen in Gaza over the 15-month-long war.
“Today the (Jenin) camp is uninhabitable and would require major reconstruction efforts for it to stand on its feet,” he said, adding that the “crisis is huge,” and that alternative housing for the displaced might be needed for around six months.
Last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israeli troops would remain in the Jenin camp once their current operation is complete – a significant change in Israeli policy.
Jenin’s mayor told CNN that the minister’s statement is “worrying” and raises “many questions about the future of the West Bank, not just Jenin and its camp.”
Meanwhile, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), said in a statement Monday that “Jenin camp has been rendered a ghost town.”
“Operations conducted both by Israeli and Palestinian security forces have led to the forced displacement of thousands of camp residents, many of whom will now have nowhere to return to. The basics of life are gone,” it said.
“Today’s shocking scenes in the West Bank undermine the fragile ceasefire reached in Gaza, and risk a new escalation,” the UNRWA statement added.","['Mostafa Salem', 'Zeena Saifi']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-talks-gaza-ceasefire-intl/index.html,Netanyahu blows past ceasefire talks deadline to confer with Trump,2025-02-02 00:00:00,"A deadline to begin talks on extending Gaza’s ceasefire arrived Monday with the Israeli prime minister in Washington, silence from his office about when a negotiating team might engage with Hamas, and considerable uncertainty about what the next stage of the fragile truce will look like.
The ceasefire, in place for just over two weeks, is set to expire on March 1. Under the terms of the deal, talks on the next phase are supposed to begin no later than Monday.
But the Israeli government has yet to publicly unveil a negotiating team for the talks, let alone send them to Qatar or Egypt, where Hamas is sending a delegation this week. Hamas has not publicly commented on Monday’s deadline.
Qatar’s prime minister, who has acted as an intermediary in the talks, said Sunday that there were “no clear details” on when or how the talks would start. “We hope to see some movement in the coming days,” Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said during a press conference in Doha.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that he sees the path forward not in Doha or Cairo, but in Washington, where he will this week become the first foreign leader to hold a formal meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Netanyahu’s office said on the eve of his departure that he had agreed with Trump’s Middle East envoy that “negotiations on the second phase of the hostage deal will begin with their meeting in Washington,” during which “they will discuss Israel’s positions.”
Since the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, Hamas and its allies have released 18 hostages held in Gaza. In exchange, the Israeli government has released 583 Palestinians held in detention – some serving life sentences for serious offenses – but also a significant number of children held without public charge or trial.
The ceasefire has seen the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gazan population centers, a surge of aid entering the enclave and, for the first time since May last year, the opening of the vital Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt for the evacuation of injured and sick Palestinians.
It has also largely held apart from a few violations – only the second respite in 15 months of war, after a brief truce in November 2023.
But the first phase of the truce was only ever meant to last 42 days. Talks for the second phase must begin Monday, the 16th day of the truce, meaning that Netanyahu is breaching the terms of the deal by talking to Trump first. Over that second period, CNN understands that the Israeli military would fully withdraw from Gaza and all living hostages, soldier and civilian, would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.
Chief among Netanyahu’s concerns this week will be what Trump wants. The American president was not yet in office during the first round of ceasefire talks, though his team played a large role in pushing Israel toward a deal.
“Our decisions and the courage of our soldiers have redrawn the map,” Netanyahu said on the tarmac of Ben Gurion Airport Sunday. “But I believe that, working closely with President Trump, we can redraw it even further and for the better.”
But Gershon Baskin, a veteran Israeli negotiator and peace activist, said in a statement that Netanyahu’s “refusal to begin negotiations on the day stipulated in the agreement is a clear violation of the agreement.”
“Israel demands that Hamas adhere to all the terms of the agreement, while simultaneously violating it in a significant way. Once again, Netanyahu is abandoning the hostages and endangering them.”
Trump claimed credit for the current ceasefire and pledged upon taking office to end foreign wars. But he has also now repeated his desire for the 2 million people of Gaza to leave so that “we just clean out that whole thing.” The forced displacement of civilians can constitute “a war crime and/or crime against humanity,” according to the United Nations.
Trump’s proposal was music to the ears of the most extreme minister in Netanyahu’s governing coalition. Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who vehemently opposed the withdrawal of Israeli forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005, wants Jews to resettle in the enclave.
“Encouraging migration (of Palestinians out of Gaza) is the only solution that will bring peace and security to the residents of Israel and alleviate the suffering of Gaza’s Arab residents,” he said after Trump expressed his desire for Palestinians to leave.
Already one minister – the far-right Itamar Ben-Gvir – has withdrawn his party from the Israeli government over the ceasefire, calling it a capitulation. Smotrich has pledged he will do the same if Israel does not renew the war in Gaza when the current, first phase of the ceasefire expires.

Stepping off a military helicopter just outside Tel Aviv, Kalderon, 54 - who also holds French citizenship - stopped to wave to friends who had gathered outside Shiba Hospital, smiling and yelling, “I love you!” In a tearful embrace in a hospital room, his four children wept as they pulled him in and stroked his hair.
“It’s over, Dad,” his daughter said. “Now you’re with us.”
In exchange, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners, of whom 18 were serving life sentences. The majority had been detained in Gaza since October 7 and had no public charges against them.
And for the first time since it was captured by Israeli forces in May 2024, the crucial Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened to allow a group of Palestinian civilians, mostly children, to be evacuated for medical treatment.
It is the fourth hostage exchange since a ceasefire went into effect on January 19. Under an agreement signed in Qatar last month, negotiations to begin a second phase are supposed to begin on Monday.
There are still 79 people taken on October 7, 2023, left in Gaza. Only 20 of those are scheduled to come out during this phase of the truce, of whom eight are said to be dead.
Siegel, 65, who has long lived in Israel, is the first American released since the ceasefire that began on January 19. Amid the rubble of Gaza City’s port, he appeared frail as militants walked him to a car. He waved briefly from a stage that had been set up. His wife Aviva, watching a feed of him being freed in Gaza, exclaimed, “Here he is, here he is, Keith!” as she embraced their son Shai.
Bibas’s children have become among the most prominent hostages held by Hamas. His son Kfir was just nine months when he was abducted, the youngest hostage taken on October 7, 2023. Kfir, his brother Ariel, and their mother Shiri have not been seen since they were taken captive. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel never confirmed their deaths.
Yarden Bibas’ reunion with his sister Ofri and father Eli was decidedly more somber. Meeting at Re’im Military Base in southern Israel, the three held each other in a deep embrace, and wept.
“There are no words to describe the relief of holding Yarden in our hands, embracing him, and hearing his voice,” the Bibas family said in statement, adding they “continue with hope” for the return of his wife and sons.
The release of the three men Saturday was particularly weighty in Israel because of the disorderly scenes that surrounded the release of two Israeli and five Thai hostages in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, on Thursday. Thousands of Palestinian jostled the two Israelis as they were escorted to Red Cross vehicles.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded assurances from the intermediaries who negotiated the ceasefire that the scenes would not be repeated.
The message seems to have been received. On a bright Saturday morning, masked militants from Hamas’ Qassam Brigades took to stages adorned with anti-Israel banners, honoring their fallen military commander Muhammad Al-Masri, better known as Muhammad Al-Deif, whose assassination by Israel last July was acknowledged by Hamas this week.
Representatives from the International Committee for the Red Cross signed release papers provided by the Hamas militants, and the hostages were briefly paraded on stage and made to wave to the crowd before being whisked away to be transferred to the Israeli military.
The release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel’s Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank also brought jubilation to crowds who gathered for their release in Ramallah. Huge crowds swarmed a Red Cross bus as freed prisoners draped in keffiyehs floated into the arms of supporters.
Among the prisoners released was Mohammad El-Halabi, the director of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a US-based humanitarian organization. El-Halabi was arrested in 2016, and later found guilty of diverting money from humanitarian projects to Hamas’ military wing. World Vision denied the allegations at the time and said the legal process was unfair.
Following his release Saturday, El-Halabi told CNN that he had lost 40 kilograms (88 lb) of weight in detention since October 7.
“The food was not even sufficient for a small child – it was deliberately inadequate. The quality was also terrible… there was a famine inside the prison,” he told CNN, adding that dozens of prisoners fainted every day due to malnutrition.
“Thank God I got out of prison,” he said.
A number of those released were immediately transferred to hospitals in Ramallah due to their health condition, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Media office.
“Hamas got the message from Israel through Qatar to avoid the chaos we witnessed last Thursday,” Gershon Baskin, a veteran Israeli negotiator who is often in touch with Palestinian colleagues, said in a statement. “Hamas may be able to make a strong show of their control, but the people of Gaza have witnessed the destruction all around them and hold Hamas responsible, along with Israel of course.”
“There is no military victory over Hamas, that should be clear to all. The are no winners in this war. We have all lost,” Bashkin added.

The foreign ministers of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt issued a wide-ranging statement Saturday, saying they hoped to work with Trump on a two-state solution in the Middle East.
But they pushed back on Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza. Without specifically referencing the president’s proposal, the ministers reiterated a commitment to rebuilding the enclave while ensuring “the continued presence of Palestinians in their homeland.”
The nations “firmly rejected any actions that threaten these rights, including settlement expansion, forced evictions, home demolitions, land annexation, or the displacement of Palestinians through direct expulsion or coerced migration,” they wrote after a meeting of the foreign ministers in Cairo.
In January, Trump said he had spoken with the king of Jordan about potentially building housing elsewhere in the Middle East and moving more than 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries.
“I said to him that I’d love you to take on more, because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One. “You’re talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.”
“I don’t know, something has to happen, but it’s literally a demolition site right now,” Trump said. “Almost everything’s demolished, and people are dying there, so I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.”
The statement from the Arab foreign ministers touched on a range of topics relating to Gaza’s reconstruction, as the fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel allows the region to assess the impact of a brutal 15-month conflict.
The group hailed “the important role played by the United States in facilitating the deal,” for which both Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have sought credit.
They also “called for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and rejected any attempts to partition the Strip,” and pointed to the “indispensable role” of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees or UNRWA, two days after Israel’s ban on the agency went into effect.",['Rob Picheta'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/31/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages-saturday-intl/index.html,Gaza: American and father of youngest hostages among those due for release Saturday,2025-01-31 00:00:00,"Hamas announced on Friday that among the three Israeli hostages to be released from Gaza on Saturday are an American dual national and the father of the youngest hostages taken from Israel on October 7, 2023.
It named three men – Keith Siegel, Yarden Bibas and Ofer Kalderon as the captives that would be freed in the latest round. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said their families had been informed.
Siegel, an Israeli-American citizen, was taken from his home in kibbutz Kfar Aza. His wife Aviva, who was kidnapped alongside him, was released in November 2023 as part of the short-lived ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.
Bibas was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his wife Shiri and two sons Kfir and Ariel. Kfir was just nine months when he was abducted, the youngest hostage taken on October 7.
Hamas claimed in November 2023 that Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas were killed in an Israeli airstrike, and released a hostage video of Yarden Bibas in which he blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for their deaths. An Israeli military spokesperson at the time called the video “psychological terror,” and Israel never confirmed their deaths, but the military has told relatives that they may not be alive, according to a spokesperson for the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
Kalderon was 52 when he was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz together with his son Erez, who was 11 at the time, and his daughter Sahar, who was 16. Erez and Sahar were also released during the November 2023 ceasefire.
The Hostage and Missing Families Forum confirmed the names, and the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said that the families of the hostages have been informed.
Hamas and allied militant groups have released 10 Israeli and five Thai hostages since a ceasefire went into effect on January 19.
Chaotic scenes surrounding the release of Israeli and Thai hostages in Gaza on Thursday brought condemnation from Israeli leaders and a temporary delay in the release of Palestinian prisoners, who were ultimately released later in the day. Netanyahu described those scenes as “shocking,” and demanded guarantees from those who mediated a ceasefire deal – Qatar, Egypt and the United States – that the incident would not be repeated.
Hamas is expected to release another 23 hostages over the course of the 42-day truce, including the three set for freedom this Saturday. Eight of them are dead, the Israeli government has confirmed.
In exchange, Israel is releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom have been held without charge, and others who have been convicted of the most serious offenses – 30 for every civilian, 50 for every Israeli soldier, and 110 for the nine hostages who are injured or sick and are not soldiers. On Saturday, Israel is expected to release 183 Palestinian prisoners, according to Hamas, 18 of whom are serving life sentences.
As of Friday, Hamas and its allies were still holding 79 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023, and three additional hostages who have been held captive since 2014.
Bibas family in the spotlight
The Bibas family, and Kfir in particular, have become one of the most recognizable victims of the October 7 terror attacks.
Kfir’s picture has been featured on many of the posters calling for the release of the hostages that have been on display across Israel and the world for the past 15 months. In it, the red-haired baby boy is holding a pink elephant toy, looking directly into the camera with a toothless smile.
The two boys and their mother were not released from Gaza during the temporary truce in late November 2023, when many women and children were released.
Shiri Bibas is one of four Israeli women still held in Gaza. The other three — Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, Inbar Hayman, 27, and Ofra Keidar, 70 — are believed to be dead, according to the Israeli military. Kfir and Ariel Bibas are the the last remaining children in captivity.
Both Siegel and Kalderon were kidnapped alongside some of their family members, several of whom have been released in November 2023 as part of the short-lived ceasefire deal. Their testimonies have provided a glimpse into the horrific realities faced by the hostages.
Aviva Siegel said that while they were held captive together, Keith would ask everyone to identify one thing they were thankful for. “Imagine being in the depths of hell and still trying to find one thing each day that you are thankful for,” she said, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
A video of Siegel in captivity was released by Hamas in April last year. Speaking to CNN at that time, Aviva Siegel said that her husband looked pale and tired. “He’s 65 years old. He was taken from his house with Hamas terrorists in his pajamas, and he’s still there, underneath the ground,” she said.
Siegel’s mother, Gladys Ruth Siegel, died in December aged 97, the family said.
Kalderon has been described by his family as a keen cyclist and expert carpenter, and a man who enjoys music and field trips with his children.
Israel warns on border
Israel has warned that if Saturday’s hostage release is as chaotic as Thursday’s then it will not open Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt, which it is supposed to do as part of the ceasefire agreement to allow sick and wounded militants and civilians to leave the enclave.
An Israeli official told CNN Friday that the opening of the Rafah crossing was conditional on there not being a repeat of the scenes in which seven hostages were forced to walk through jeering Palestinian crowds during their release in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.
“Israel sent a message (to the mediators) that if the images of Khan Younis will repeat themselves, the Rafah crossing will not open,” the official said.
If everything goes smoothly during the handover of the three Israeli hostages, the crossing will open, the official said.
Under the ceasefire agreement, up to 50 injured Palestinian militants in need of medical care will be allowed to cross into Egypt through Rafah per day. In addition to that, civilian Palestinian women and children who need medical care will also be allowed to cross to Egypt.
Egyptian state-run media reported on Friday that the country had finished its preparations for opening the border crossing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed the opening of the border.
“This will be the first medical evacuation since the ceasefire began, and the first time through Rafah since its closure in May 2024,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X Friday.
According to Ghebreyesus, between 12,000 and 14,000 people require “urgent specialized medical care outside Gaza.”
The Rafah border crossing was overseen by Hamas between 2007 and 2024, after the group took full control of Gaza after winning elections in 2006. In May, Israeli forces took over the border following their military operations against Hamas in Gaza.
More than 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage when Hamas militants launched an attack into Israel on October 7, 2023, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s subsequent military offensive against Hamas in Gaza has killed at least 47,460 people and injured more than 111,000, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed by several hours the agreed release of 110 Palestinian detainees, including dozens of minors, after live images were broadcast across Israel of a crowd of thousands jostling and cheering as the hostages were handed over to the Red Cross in the central Gazan city of Khan Younis.
He described those scenes as “shocking,” and demanded guarantees from those who mediated a ceasefire deal – Qatar, Egypt and the United States – that the incident would not be repeated.
The release Thursday morning of the captive Israeli soldier Agam Berger in Jabalya, northern Gaza, had gone off without incident – a stage-managed affair in which Hamas militants paraded her in front of cameras and then handed her to representatives from the International Committee for the Red Cross.
But the release in the early afternoon of two Israeli and five Thai civilians produced some of the most stunning images of the nearly two-week-old ceasefire, striking a painful nerve for much of the Israeli public.
Unusually, that handover was a joint affair between Hamas and several allied militant groups. Thousands of Gazans crowded in Khan Younis as Hamas and its allies staged the handover outside the razed house of former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, killed by Israeli forces in October.
Among those released was Arbel Yehoud, a 29-year-old civilian whom militants abducted from her home in the Nir Oz kibbutz on October 7, 2023. She was held captive by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Stepping out from a white van, the Israeli civilian looked gaunt and frightened. As militants walked her through a roaring crowd, she kept her head locked forward as her eyes darted left and right. The crowd jostled her back and forth as she made her way toward a waiting Red Cross vehicle.
Yehoud was returned to Israel without further incident. But for many in Israel, the images sparked fears of a repeat of an infamous, televised incident in October 2000, known colloquially as the Ramallah lynching. Two reservist Israeli soldiers – who had been detained after accidentally driven into Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank – were brutally murdered by a Palestinian mob mourning a child whom Israeli troops had killed the previous day.
Fifteen hostages have been released since a ceasefire went into effect earlier this month. Their freedom has brought some relief to a nation traumatized daily by images of civilians and soldiers held captive since October 7, 2023.
But that solace has accompanied by astounding images of Hamas militants’ elaborate handover ceremonies – clearly designed to show that the group is still standing, despite the Israeli government’s promises of “total victory” over the perpetrators of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a right-wing extremist who has threatened to withdraw from the governing coalition, has cited Hamas’s presence on the streets of Gaza as proof that Israel must return to war, saying that it was proof “of the heavy and terrible price Israel is paying for this bad deal.”
110 Palestinians released
Just as night fell, the Israeli prison authority released 110 Palestinians from Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, including a prominent former militant leader from the embattled city of Jenin.
In the West Bank town of Beitunia, which overlooks Ofer Prison, the Israeli military on Thursday shut down public celebrations by Palestinians over the detainees’ release, as has repeatedly been the case.
Israeli troops fired rubber-coated steel bullets and used tear gas and stun grenades to clear a small crowd. They dropped Arabic-language flyers warning onlookers that “the security forces will not allow demonstrations in support of terrorist organizations.”
At least 61 Palestinians were injured, according to local paramedics. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its members treated patients with injuries from live rounds, rubber bullets and tear gas, as well as those sustained falling over.
The release was met with jubilation in the streets of Ramallah, where hundreds gathered to meet some of the released detainees. Many of those gathered there chanted in support of Hamas’ military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades. A smaller crowd of Fatah supporters has gathered on a nearby hill.
Among those freed were 30 children – some held without charge and none convicted, according to Adalah, a legal aid organization. Also released were 32 prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment and 48 prisoners with “high sentences.” Some of those with serious sentences were due to be released to Egypt, as per the terms of the ceasefire deal agreed to in Doha.
The most prominent to be released on Thursday was Zakaria Zubeidi, former commander of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the military wing of the Fatah party, which governs the West Bank. His mother, brother, and son have all been killed by the Israeli military. Zubeidi rose through the ranks of the militant group during the Second Intifada in the early 2000s.
A former child actor, Zubeidi co-founded The Freedom Theatre in his hometown of the Jenin Refugee Camp following that conflict, to promote cultural education among his compatriots.
He was arrested in 2019 and charged with involvement in shooting attacks against Israelis. He gained near cult status among many Palestinians after he was among a group who tunneled out of Israel’s high security Gilboa prison in 2021, before being re-arrested several days later.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/31/middleeast/toddler-gaza-evac-israel-latam-intl/index.html,"This toddler has only days to live, doctors warn. But Israel has paused her medical evacuation out of Gaza.",2025-01-31 05:02:27,"Doctors say 2-year-old Habiba al-Askari has days to live as gangrene creeps up her arms and legs, and only an urgent medical evacuation out of Gaza may save her life.
She has a rare genetic condition: protein C deficiency, which causes excessive blood clotting and can lead to a slow death. The condition is highly treatable – but not in Gaza, where healthcare institutions and supplies have been decimated by Israel’s yearslong war in the Palestinian enclave.
Earlier this month, international aid groups worked through the complex process of obtaining permission from Israeli authorities to allow Habiba to leave Gaza for treatment.
Habiba did receive formal permission to leave Gaza, according to COGAT, the Israeli agency that coordinates permissions for movement in and out of Gaza. And authorities in nearby Jordan were set to bring her to Amman for treatment, following a CNN report on her case. Earlier this week, a complicated mission was set in motion, with the Jordanian military prepared to evacuate Habiba on Wednesday.
But at the last minute, Israeli authorities delayed the mission, Jordanian authorities tell CNN – a crushing surprise for her family and doctors. For now she remains in Gaza, her condition worsening by the hour.
“Habiba’s life is in danger now,” her distraught mother Rana told CNN on Thursday, in a flood of tears. “I do not understand why they won’t allow her out to get medical treatment. What crime did she commit?”
COGAT did not respond to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the delay.
Habiba is one of at least 2,500 children in Gaza in urgent need of medical evacuation, according to the UN. Under the recently signed ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, which controls Gaza, Israeli authorities are supposed to increase the number of Gaza residents allowed out for treatment.
But no medical evacuations from Gaza have taken place for two weeks. The last evacuation was on January 16, when just 12 patients were evacuated to European countries, according to the World Health Organization. Approximately 12,000 people in Gaza are still awaiting medical evacuation, according to the UN.
COGAT previously told CNN that it has enabled 24 medical evacuations from Gaza through Israel to other countries “in recent months,” for 1,075 Gaza residents seeking medical care.
Doctors warn of amputation
On Thursday morning, Habiba was admitted to an intensive care unit in Gaza with a suspected lung infection. Surrounded by foreign and local doctors scrambling to keep her alive, she lay barely conscious, moaning in pain between each labored breath.
The toddler’s arms and right leg have turned black with gangrene. Doctors told CNN that her right leg will have to be amputated, and it may be too late to save her arms.
Gangrene can lead to sepsis — an infection spreading to the bloodstream — that raises the risk of rapid organ failure and death.
A senior Jordanian official told CNN that Amman is continuing to push the request to evacuate Habiba’s with Israeli authorities, and stands ready to move immediately.
With Gaza’s health system under fire, doctors do not have the diagnostic tools to definitively determine what is happening to her, Dr. Mohamed Kuziez, an American pediatrician from Colorado, who recently left Gaza after volunteering with NGO Rahma Worldwide, told CNN.
Dr. Kuziez first treated Habiba several weeks ago, in Gaza City, and oversaw her care as medics waited for Israeli permission to move her south, a first step in the evacuation process.
But as soon as he landed back in the US, he received news of the dramatic deterioration in her condition. “I’m trying to be there to support the mom, to try and provide whatever medical advice we can provide,” he said, choking back tears.
“But in the back of my mind, I am worried it may have gotten too far. There’s still hope for her, but it’s just decreasing by the minute.”
He’s tormented by the knowledge that Habiba’s condition could have been treated in time, if she had had access to the right facility. When Dr. Kuziez left Gaza, he recalled, “my heart wanted to just take her with me in my arms and run across the border with her.”
Blocking her evacuation will be a death sentence, he warned. “For anybody with medical knowledge, it seems like a deliberate push to essentially kill this child. There’s no other way to describe it. This child needs emergency critical care.”","['Jomana Karadsheh', 'Abeer Salman']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/31/middleeast/northern-gaza-return-destruction-intl/index.html,"‘We came back for nothing:’ Returning home to northern Gaza, Palestinians find death and destruction",2025-01-31 05:01:48,"Khamis and Ahmad Imarah knew they wouldn’t find much more than rubble when returning to their home in northern Gaza. But they had to go. Their father and brother are still buried under the debris, more than a year after their home was struck by Israeli forces.
Standing in the middle of the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood in Gaza City on Tuesday, all Khamis Imarah could see was utter devastation. “When I came back here my heart was ripped apart. The only thing that brought me back was my father and brother,” he told CNN.
“I don’t want anything else. What I am asking for is to find my father and brother and that’s it, that’s all.”
The Gaza Government Office said Wednesday that some 500,000 displaced Palestinians — almost a quarter of the enclave’s population — had made the journey to the decimated north in the first 72 hours after Israeli forces opened the Netzarim corridor, which separates it from the south.
The two Imarah brothers walked 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) to reach Al-Shujaiya, a treacherous journey they made with several small children. They found their home almost completely gone, with just one room still partially standing.
Rummaging through the rubble, Khamis came across his mother’s green knitting bag, with a couple of balls of yarn and two crochet hooks still inside, as if she had only just put it down.
“She used to like to knit, she used to like wool and things like this,” he said, going through the supplies. “Oh God, my mom had so many stories. She is a storyteller, and she likes the old stories. She was an entertainer. God be with you, Mother,” he told CNN.
Khamis and Ahmad’s mother was injured in an Israeli strike and was later evacuated to Egypt, one of the few Palestinians allowed to leave the strip to get medical treatment before Israel closed the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt in May 2024. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that only 436 patients, most of them children, had been allowed to be evacuated since May, out of the estimated 12,000 who urgently need medical evacuation.
Israeli military strikes have turned most of Gaza to rubble. According to the UN, some 69% of all structures in the strip have been destroyed or damaged in the past 15 months, with Gaza City the worst hit.
Returning after more than a year
Israel forced most residents of northern Gaza to leave the area early in the war, issuing evacuation orders and telling people to move south. Once people left, return was impossible, meaning that most of those coming back this week are doing so for the first time in more than a year. And while nine in 10 Gaza residents have been displaced during the war, those forced to flee the north have been homeless for the longest.
The journey back north is long and difficult, Khamis told CNN, with roads destroyed and mud and piles of rubble obstructing the way. Transport is not widely available, so about a third of the people were making their way back on foot, according to OCHA.
“You enter from one neighborhood to another and it’s all mounds of rubble that have not been cleared … and there were martyrs on the way, on the road where, until today, no one has picked them up. There are fresh bodies and bodies that have (decomposed) as well,” Khamis said.
He urged others looking to make the journey back north to reconsider. “Because there is no water, no electricity or even food, no tents, you sleep in the rubble,” he said.
Mohammad Salha, director of Al-Awda Hospital in Tal Al-Zaatar, said there is currently no space in northern Gaza to establish camps for displaced people returning home. The area was densely built-up before the war and the enormous scale of damage means there are now huge mountains of rubble and debris everywhere.
“There are no camps for displaced residents to stay in. Some people are trying to repair their damaged homes, but northern Gaza urgently needs intervention — humanitarian institutions must provide shelter, water and camps,” he told CNN.
The situation in the north is so dire that some of those who have made the journey have had little choice but to turn back and return to the refugee camps down south.
Arwa Al-Masri, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun in the northeastern corner of the strip, said the men from her family went home in the past few days to see what is left of their houses.
“They were shocked to find the amount of destruction and the lifelessness. There is nothing. No water — my brother had to go from Beit Hanoun to Jabalya to get water and then he had to go to Gaza (City) to call us to tell us not to come back yet. Most of the people who went back north have said there is no life and massive destruction only,” she told CNN at a shelter inside a school run by the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) south of the Netzarim corridor.
But while she and her children cannot yet go back to her home in the north — or what remains of it — Al-Masri’s stay at the shelter is also uncertain, because of impending bans on UNRWA operations within Israel and on the prohibition of Israeli authorities from cooperating with UNRWA.
“When UNRWA stops operating, people are not going to find food and many people who are in UNRWA shelter schools will not be able to stay. There will be no tents and shelter available,” she told CNN.
‘No one is left’
Discovering that the place they once called home was almost completely gone was just the latest in a series of heartbreaks Khamis and Ahmad Imarah have suffered over the past 15 months.
The two brothers said that of the 60 members of their extended family, only 11 have survived the war.
“My daughter spent 45 days in the intensive care unit, my younger son is until today traumatized by seeing his mother being killed,” Ahmad told CNN, adding that his daughter’s right arm remains paralyzed after she was struck by shrapnel in her neck and foot.
The family fled Al-Shujaiya after receiving text messages from the Israeli military telling them to leave the area. Khamis said the whole family — his brother and sisters and their in-laws — went to his brother’s house in Al-Mughraqa, just south of the Netzarim corridor.
“It was afternoon prayers time when our house in Al-Mughraqa was hit by a strike. I still don’t know how I got out of the house,” he said.
At one point during the interview, Ahmad’s son Walid came by. Asked by his father where his mom was, the child pointed up to the sky.
“Why did they tell us to go south? Imagine a four-year-old boy telling you here is my mother and here is my aunt, (their bodies) all ripped in pieces in front of him. I covered his face and he was screaming. His aunts, and uncles, his grandfather and an uncle, no one is left,” he said.
Khamis told CNN his wife died in the Israeli strike, just a week after giving birth to a baby girl who was also killed.
“We were very happy. I wish I had a picture of my newborn but I don’t have any. I waited a long time to have my daughter and then her and her mom vanished together,” he said, adding that their graves were destroyed by the Israeli military just days after the family buried them.
“You take them and bury them in the cemetery and then when you go a few days later to see the cemetery, you don’t find them because they have been erased by the bulldozers. The (Israeli forces) didn’t leave anything. Even the martyrs and the bodies they have dug up. They didn’t leave a thing,” he said, looking around the destroyed neighborhood.
“We came back to the north for nothing,” he said. But he quickly added that he was determined to stay and rebuild. “I am from Gaza and I won’t leave. Even if it was harder and more difficult than this, I want to live in Gaza and I won’t leave it. I will only leave Gaza to go to Heaven,” he said.
US President Donald Trump last week suggested Gaza should be “cleaned out” by removing Palestinians living there to Jordan and Egypt — either on a temporary or permanent basis.
The comment sparked outrage and rebuke across the Middle East, with both Egypt and Jordan rejecting the idea.
Khamis told CNN the importance of staying goes well beyond his own personal desires.
“This is ingrained in our minds, we will stay. We will not leave this place, because this land is not ours but our grandparents’ and our ancestors’ before us. How am I supposed to leave it? To leave the house of my father, and grandfather and brothers?” he said.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/middleeast/israel-unrwa-ban-comes-into-effect-gaza-west-bank-intl/index.html,"‘We rely on God, then on UNRWA’: Palestinians fear drastic effects as Israeli ban on UN agency comes into force",2025-01-30 13:20:33,"Iman Helles, a displaced mother sheltering in a facility run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, fears that she will now be “thrown out to the streets” with her three children.
Israel’s ban on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) came into effect on Thursday, and Helles relies almost fully on the organization to support her family in the devastated enclave.
After their home in Gaza City’s eastern Shejaiya district was destroyed during the war, they were forced to move into a former girls’ elementary school that now serves as a shelter run by UNWRA in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. “We live in an agency school. If the agency is banned… we won’t eat or drink,” Helles told CNN. “If they force us out, where will I go with my small children?”
Helles is among millions of Palestinians relying on the UN agency for sustenance, education and livelihoods, not only in Gaza but also across the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem.
In October, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, passed two bills – one barring UNRWA from activity within Israel, and another banning Israeli authorities from any contact with UNRWA. The second bill revokes a 1967 treaty that allows the agency to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control.
The legislation came into effect Thursday, and it is expected to severely restrict UNRWA’s activities, with a potentially devastating human impact.
Israel has been trying to shut down the agency for years, but it escalated measures against it after Hamas-led militants attacked the country on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. Israel accused some UNRWA employees of participating in that attack.
A UN investigation found that nine employees from UNWRA’s 13,000 staff in Gaza “may have” been involved in the attack and no longer work at the agency. But UNRWA has long maintained that Israel hasn’t provided it with evidence against its former employees. The agency says it had regularly provided Israel with a full list of its staff members and has accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, coercing them into making false confessions about ties to Hamas.
How Israel intends to proceed with the ban remains unclear, but some of its effects are already underway. On Sunday, Israel ordered UNRWA to “vacate all premises in occupied East Jerusalem and cease its operations in them by 30 January 2025,” the UN agency said.
Israel also shortened the validity of all visas for UNRWA’s international staff to Wednesday, the UN said. This “is tantamount to being evicted,” UNRWA spokesperson Jonathan Fowler said.
“UNRWA’s international staff at the East Jerusalem office had to evacuate and relocate to Amman, Jordan earlier in the day,” the UN said Wednesday. “Office equipment and vehicles have been moved out, and efforts are continuing to digitize its archives.”
‘Disastrous’ effect
Days before the ban, the UN warned against its detrimental effects, while Israel insisted the agency is replaceable, and that it is committed to the flow of aid into Gaza.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on Tuesday that its implementation will be “disastrous.”
“The government of Israel claims that UNRWA’s services can be transferred to other entities,” Lazzarini said, adding that his agency is unique in its mandate “to provide public-like services,” which “can only be transferred to a functioning state.”
In a Tuesday speech at the UN, Israel’s representative, Danny Danon, said that “this legislation is about what is happening in Israel; it’s not about what’s happening in Gaza, in Jordan, in Lebanon. But we will not allow UNRWA to work from Israel.”
Danon added that UNRWA’s role in Gaza is expected to be phased out and replaced by other UN agencies. “I think it’s going to be a gradual process until other agencies will step in and will take their positions,” Danon told reporters.
Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said on Wednesday that some of these agencies will include the World Food Programme (WFP), UN children’s agency (UNICEF) and UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), which already operate in Gaza. All three agencies have worked closely with UNRWA, with WFP and UNICEF condemning the ban on their partner UN agency.
More than 912,000 Palestinian refugees are also registered with UNRWA in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, around a quarter of whom live in 19 refugee camps. In the West Bank, UNRWA caters to more than 45,000 students, and runs some 96 schools, 43 healthcare facilities and 19 women’s centers. It has also provided loans amounting to $225.3 million.
Israel insists Palestinians will not experience an aid vacuum, saying that UNRWA’s aid contribution is minimal – a claim refuted by both UNRWA and other UN agencies.
Other agencies “will have no choice but to continue and to increase their efforts,” Danon said.
UNRWA workers’ safety
The ban also raises questions about the safety of thousands of UNRWA workers in Gaza, of whom more than 270 have already been killed since the war began, according to the agency. The conflict has also killed more than 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the health ministry there.
Asked if UNRWA staff are safe, Danon said: “It’s not (up to) us to take care of their safety.”
Mencer described UNRWA on Wednesday as “a failed institution” that is “permeated with terrorism.” He then accused the agency of perpetuating the conflict, saying it “glorifies Jew-killing, glorifies jihad.”
Hoda Hussein, who was displaced with her family from north of Khan Younis, described the UNRWA ban as “a second starvation and a new war on the Gaza Strip.”
“We rely on God, then on them (UNRWA),” she said, adding that for 15 months they had nowhere else to go.
“We rely on it fully, for everything.”","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Kareem Khadder', 'Abeer Salman', 'Mohammad Al Sawalihi']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/middleeast/israel-hostages-released-gaza-thursday-intl/index.html,Israel says three Israeli and five Thai hostages to be released in Gaza Thursday,2025-01-29 16:10:46,"The three Israeli hostages due to be released in Gaza on Thursday have been named by the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), which also confirmed that five Thai nationals will be freed.
“The list of names received from Hamas today by the mediators Qatar and Egypt includes: Arbel Yehoud (29 years old), Agam Berger (19) and Gadi Moses (80),” the PMO said.
The names of the five Thai citizens to be freed have not been made public.
Israeli authorities are also expected to release 110 Palestinian prisoners on Thursday. Of those, 32 were sentenced to life imprisonment, and another 30 are children, according to Hamas.
A total of 33 Israeli hostages taken captive by Hamas and other armed groups in the October 7 attacks were set to be freed in phase one of the ceasefire and hostages release deal between Israel and Hamas. Two rounds of releases have already taken place. Meanwhile, Israel will release a total of almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in the first phase.
Eight of the remaining Israeli hostages set to be released are dead, Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said on Monday.
All three Israeli hostages named for release on Thursday are believed to be alive, according to the Hostage and Missing Families Forum.
Yehoud was kidnapped from her home in the Nir Oz kibbutz, along with her partner Ariel Cunio, the forum said on Wednesday.
Moses, a grandfather and keen agronomist, also was taken from Nir Oz.
The kibbutz was among the hardest-hit of the communities targeted by Hamas in the attacks of October 7, 2023, with more than a quarter of its population of 400 being either killed or kidnapped.
Osnat Peri, the chairwoman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, described the news of the releases as “an exciting moment for us, and another step on the long road to bringing all our loved ones home.”
However, she also noted that of the 76 people kidnapped from the community, 29 remained in Gaza, and said that the “struggle will continue” until all were returned.
“Many others were murdered, homes were burned, and the entire community was uprooted,” she said, adding, “The road to recovery and the return of everyone home is still long, but we are not giving up.”
Moses’ family said Wednesday they had “received with great excitement the wonderful news of our beloved Gadi’s return to us tomorrow,” thanking “the people of Israel for their embrace and support.”
The third Israeli hostage to be returned Thursday, Berger, was a soldier abducted from a military base besid e the Nahal Oz kibbutz.
The hostages forum said it too would “not give up or stop at any stage until all hostages return home – down to the very last one – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial.”
Hostage thanks Israeli soldier for ‘saving her life’
The news of Thursday’s releases comes as a former hostage thanked a female soldier freed last week for saving her life.
Amit Soussana, who was released during an earlier, short-lived ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in November 2023, spoke in an emotional interview with Israeli TV about her experiences in captivity – and the bravery of her fellow captive Liri Albag, who was freed on Saturday.
Soussana credited Albag, 19, with talking one of her captors out of killing her.
The 40-year-old lawyer spent the first three weeks of her captivity in solitary confinement, with only her captor – who allegedly sexually assaulted her – for company. But after Israel launched its ground offensive in late October, she was moved to another location within the Gaza Strip.
On Tuesday, she told journalist Ben Shani, in an episode of “Uvda” on Israel’s Channel Keshet 12, that there were four other hostages at the second site – including Albag.
The group immediately bonded with Soussana and told her about their captors, singling out one who she labelled a “psychopath.” On one occasion, she said, he hit her in the neck with his gun, and threatened to “kill” her.
He and others then bound her arms and legs to two sticks and strung her up between two sofas, said Soussana. “I was tied to one stick by my hands and one by my feet and hung upside down and with duct tape on my face,” she added, while one of the men beat her.
She said she quickly learnt that they thought she was an IDF officer and were trying to obtain information from her.
Soussana alleged the other hostages were brought in to convince her to confess. Then, back in the room, she was threatened at gunpoint.
After her captor left, Albag told her she didn’t think that they would follow through, but asked nonetheless if Soussana had a message for her family. She said she loved them.
Soussana said the “psychopath” liked Albag, so she asked her to explain that she was a civilian. Describing her as “a force,” Soussana said that she was “something special” who “had power against him.”
But after two weeks together, the women were separated and Soussanna was transferred again – this time to Hamas’ network of underground tunnels.
Her stay there was short lived compared with some of the remaining hostages, who have been held for more than 15 months.","['Lauren Izso', 'Lianne Kolirin']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/middleeast/pregnant-women-girls-gaza-war-intl-latam/index.html,The impact of Israel’s war in Gaza on pregnant and postpartum women and babies in Gaza,2025-01-28 05:01:03,"Israel has inflicted “serious and sometimes life-threatening danger” on pregnant and postpartum women and girls in Gaza over 15 months of bombardment and siege, according to a new Human Rights Watch report.
The 50-page report, “‘Five Babies in One Incubator’: Violations of Pregnant Women’s Rights Amid Israel’s Assault on Gaza,” was published by the US-based advocacy group on Tuesday.
It details attacks on medical facilities and healthcare workers in Gaza that “directly harmed women and girls during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period” and says the war has increased the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, postpartum hemorrhage and underweight newborns.
HRW accused Israel of enforcing an unlawful blockade, a near-total ban on water, food and electricity, starvation as a method of war, attacks on the medical system, and repeated forcible transfer – violating the right to follow-up and postnatal care for pregnant women and girls, and their children.
Israel is “obligated to use all the resources at its disposal to ensure that everyone in Gaza, including pregnant women and girls and their children, are able to enjoy their human right to health,” the report said. “This includes ensuring the full restoration of Gaza’s healthcare system so that all patients, including pregnant women and babies, have access to quality medical care.”
HRW repeated allegations that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which Israel strongly denies. Israel has also been taken to the UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice, on allegations of genocide.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military and COGAT, the Israeli aid agency, for comment.
Responding to a question about Israeli attacks on medical facilities and health care workers in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repeated allegations that Hamas uses hospitals for its military operations. Hamas denies using hospitals as cover. CNN cannot independently verify either claim.
COGAT denied blocking relief, delaying the entry of fuel, or limiting the number of humanitarian teams that can go into Gaza, in a statement to CNN.
About 66,474 aid trucks have entered the strip, the agency said. More than 11,000 requests for humanitarian coordination across Gaza were approved, COGAT added. Since October 7, more than 30,460 tons of medical equipment have been transferred, over 53,040 tons of water have been transported through crossings, according to COGAT. The agency said it had facilitated the entry of over 1,300 doctors and humanitarian teams entering and exiting Gaza.
Israel’s onslaught since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has wiped out entire families, decimated the medical system, and supplies, spawning starvation, disease and displacement.
At least 47,306 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health there. Of those, 12,316 were women and another 808 were babies under aged one, Gaza’s Government Media Office (GMO) reported on January 24. Although a fragile ceasefire began last week, the survival challenges facing new and expecting mothers in the enclave remains dire.
Babies dying ‘in front of us’
More than 1,054 health workers and medical professionals have been killed, including at least six pediatricians and five obstetrician-gynecologists, HRW said, citing the health ministry in Gaza.
As of January, emergency obstetric and newborn care is available at seven out of 18 partially functioning hospitals in Gaza, four out of 11 field hospitals, and one community health center, according to HRW.
The rate of miscarriage in Gaza has increased by 300% since October 7, 2023, the International Planned Parenthood Federation said in July. Two Palestinian women told HRW their fetuses died after they were injured by explosive weapons attacks that also killed their partners.
Even for those who make it to a medical facility, hospitals offer little respite. Women can be “rushed out” within hours of childbirth because staff are overwhelmed by scores of patients injured by bombardment, according to HRW.
Mayas Sufyan Musa, 25, told CNN that when she journeyed on foot to Al-Emirati Hospital, in Rafah, to give birth to her daughter, Maria, on February 27, she was startled by crowds of desperate Palestinians seeking refuge.
“I did not get complete and sufficient privacy during my birth. I was very afraid of bleeding,” said Musa. “I faced great difficulty in giving birth due to fear of the shelling next to the hospital.
“My husband was informed that I had to leave immediately … It was a very difficult moment, and the cleanliness in the hospital was non-existent.”
For pregnant women in Gaza, the stress of trying to survive attacks coupled with food and water shortages could weaken the immune system, harm the fetus, and lead to preterm birth, HRW said. Dr Adnan Radi, a medic at Al Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, told the agency that most of the babies delivered by staff have severely low birthweight and are dying of perinatal asphyxia.
“We try to intubate the babies. Sometimes it has helped, but the picture is very gloomy,” Dr. Radi said in the HRW report, adding that “in the last month I can remember more than six babies with low birthweight dying in front of me.”
Meanwhile, shortages of antibacterial materials can increase the risk of sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis among newborns, Maram Al Shurafa, an aid worker for the NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in Gaza, told CNN.
‘I started begging that God would take the baby’
In sprawling displacement camps, parents say they cannot find enough food, clean water, warmth or sanitation facilities. Instead, caregivers resort to feeding babies with infant formula made from dirty water, compounding the risk of dehydration, hepatitis A and skin infections according to HRW.
Pregnant and breastfeeding women sharing toilets in crowded spaces are especially vulnerable to infections including UTIs, which can lead to preterm labor, low birth weight, and stillbirths, according to Al Shurafa, a program officer for MAP.
“Women may feel uncomfortable or self-conscious breastfeeding in such conditions,” said Al Shurafa. “This lack of privacy can lead to stress and anxiety, which in turn affects the mother’s ability to relax and establish a successful breastfeeding routine.”
More than 48,000 pregnant women are experiencing emergency or catastrophic food insecurity, the UN’s reproductive rights agency said in December.
At least 56 children have starved to death, according to Zahir Al-Wahidi, the director of Information Systems at Gaza’s health ministry. Eight infants and newborns have reportedly died from hypothermia, the UN’s children’s agency said in January.
Musa, who is displaced in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, told CNN that baby Maria, is malnourished.
“The severity and ferocity of the suffering was concentrated in physical displacement,” she said. “I was afraid that we would be exposed to direct shelling or missile fragments, and from the rain and cold and the flooding of the tents.”
Israa Mazen Diab al-Ghul, 30, a pregnant woman displaced in Nuseirat, central Gaza, told HRW that in early 2024, she and her relatives had nothing to drink but sea water for two days. “I vomited, and I was worried it would kill the baby … I started begging that God would take the baby, so I wouldn’t need to give birth during this war.”
Communications disruptions impede womens’ access to hotlines and online information, while power cuts disrupt ultrasounds, and blood and urine tests, HRW said.
One prenatal care patient displaced in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, told CNN she fainted by the time she arrived at Al-Awda Hospital, because she was so exhausted by traveling on foot and lack of nutrition. She could not afford vitamins to alleviate her symptoms.
“Everything is scarce,” said Rahaf Umm Khaled, 21, who is four months pregnant. “I want the war to end completely. I want to give birth to my child in good health, and I want us to return to our homes safely and soundly.”","['Sana Noor Haq', 'Ibrahim Dahman']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/middleeast/israel-far-right-trump-gaza-plan-analysis-intl/index.html,Trump’s plan to ‘clean out’ Gaza wins backing from Israel’s far right,2025-01-28 16:59:58,"US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his proposal to “clean out” Gaza by removing Palestinians living there to Jordan and Egypt, a plan which has appalled some allies but has been quickly embraced by Israel’s far right.
Having first floated the idea Saturday, Trump warmed to his theme Monday, saying of Gaza’s population: “I’d like to get them living in an area where they can live without disruption and revolution and violence so much.”
He has not specified whether such emigration would be voluntary. The forcible displacement of civilians “can constitute a war crime and/or crime against humanity” depending on the context, according to the United Nations.
“I think you can get people living in areas that are a lot safer and maybe a lot better and maybe a lot more comfortable,” he said on Monday.
While there has been no response from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, the idea was applauded by far-right Israeli politicians.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionism party, said Trump had recognized that Gaza was “a breeding ground for terror,” and “there is no doubt that in the long run, encouraging migration is the only solution that will bring peace and security to the residents of Israel and alleviate the suffering of Gaza’s Arab residents.”
Smotrich, who also has a ministerial position in the defense ministry, said he was working on a plan to implement Trump’s vision. “When he wants something, it happens,” he said. Smotrich has been advocating for what he calls “the voluntary emigration of Gaza Arabs to countries around the world” since 2023.
But the idea of displacement, voluntary or otherwise, is horrifying to Jordan and Egypt and likely alarming to other Arab allies of the US, threatening decades of international consensus about the right of Palestinians to a homeland. Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister, said Sunday: “Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians.”
“Our rejection for the deportation is steadfast and unchanging.”
Trump said the removal of Palestinians might be temporary or “long-term,” but Arab critics allege that Palestinians have never been allowed by Israel to return to land once removed.
Neither Egypt nor Jordan would contemplate being party to a repeat of the Palestinian ‘Nakba’ or ‘catastrophe’ in 1948. Roughly 700,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes when the state of Israel was born. A second iteration would be tantamount to condoning and supporting ethnic cleansing.
Much like Denmark hopes Trump will abandon his ideas for US control of Greenland, the moderate Arab states will be praying that the US President forgets about transferring the Gazans.
The comparison was not lost on Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who said in an interview with Sky News Tuesday that “Palestine cannot be deleted and Palestinians cannot be expelled. My suggestion: Instead of Palestinians, try to expel Israelis to Greenland. Take them to Greenland so you can kill two birds (with) one stone.”
Saudi-UAE silence
Jordan and Egypt seem likely to huddle with their allies in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, in an effort to present a united front.
So far, the Saudis and Emiratis have remained publicly silent on the Trump plan. King Abdullah II of Jordan has also said nothing about his call with Trump on Saturday. But the Jordanian court pointedly released a read-out of his call Monday with new Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which may have been an effort at damage limitation.
The statement said they discussed ways to “enhance regional security and stability…and means to strengthen the strategic partnership between Jordan and the United States, as well as keenness to maintain coordination and consultation on various issues.”
The response from Cairo was more puzzling. A senior Egyptian official denied that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had spoken with Trump, despite the latter’s assertion Monday that they had spoken. Trump declined to say directly if the Egyptian president had an opinion on taking additional Palestinian refugees.
“He’s in a very rough part of the world, to be honest, as they say, it’s a rough neighborhood, but I think he can do it,” Trump said.
The Egyptian official added that readouts between the Egyptian president and heads of state are released when they take place. The Egyptian Presidency itself has made no comment about any call and the White House hasn’t released a readout.
Trump also appears to have nodded towards the belief among some Israelis that Gaza isn’t really Palestinian land anyway.
“You know, when you look at the Gaza Strip, it’s been hell for so many years, and it just seems to be this – various civilizations start here, started thousands of years before,” he said Monday.
That fits right in with the perspective of people like the former Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party.
Trump’s remarks will also encourage the idea among some Israeli right-wing groups such as Nachala that Israel should establish settlements in Gaza. Daniella Weiss, who leads Nachala, told CNN last year: “No Arab, I’m speaking about more than two million Arabs. They will not stay there. We Jews will be in Gaza.”
Foreign aid as potential leverage
After a year of transformative upheaval in the Middle East, even the idea that millions of Palestinians might be moved from their homes is potentially a source of still greater instability. Sisi has previously said that taking in Gazans would threaten Egypt’s peace agreement with Israel because of the risk that some of them would resume fighting the Jewish state from within his country’s borders.
The risk is existential to Jordan, which has more than a million refugees from neighboring countries as well as about 2.4 million registered Palestinian refugees. Indeed, more than half of its inhabitants are of Palestinian descent, and its demography would be transformed by another influx. But Jordan cannot afford to dismiss Trump’s idea out of hand. A country of few resources, its 2023 budget deficit stood at 5.1% of its economic output, and a fifth of its workforce is unemployed. It is heavily reliant on foreign aid and is the second biggest recipient of US aid in the Middle East after Israel, with more than $1.7 billion delivered in 2023.
Trump has already moved to put foreign aid and tariffs at the center of a foreign policy whose first tenets have been more stick than carrot. That will not be lost on the Jordanian and Egyptian governments now in the crosshairs. Egypt is the region’s third-biggest recipient of US aid, with $1.5 billion delivered in 2023.
“I wish he would take some,” Trump said of Sisi on Monday, referring to Gazans. “We help them a lot, and I’m sure he can help us, he’s a friend of mine.”
Were Trump to persist with the idea, the prospect of extending the Abraham Accords to include normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia – a centerpiece of his Middle East policy – would also be jeopardized. While Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has close personal ties with Trump, he has repeatedly made clear that normalization is linked to a pathway to a Palestinian state. Emptying Gaza would not fit with that priority.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/middleeast/israel-hamas-eight-hostages-dead-intl/index.html,Israel says eight of the remaining hostages to be released by Hamas in phase one of deal are dead,2025-01-27 21:33:56,"Eight of the remaining hostages set to be released by Hamas in the first phase of a ceasefire agreement with Israel are dead, according to an Israeli government spokesperson.
The rest of the 33 hostages who were expected to be returned from Gaza to their families are alive, David Mencer said in a briefing on Monday, including seven who have already been returned. Israeli authorities were notified of the hostages’ status after receiving a list from Hamas, he said.
According to Mencer, the eight dead were killed by Hamas. The Palestinian militant group has not commented on their cause of death.
The first phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal – which started on January 19 – will see dozens of hostages taken captive by Hamas and other armed groups in the October 7 attacks being freed.
The families of all the hostages, live or dead, set to be released in phase one of the deal were contacted by Israeli authorities Sunday evening, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum confirmed to CNN.
Of the 26 hostages still to be released in phase one, 21 are men, three are women, and two are children, ranging in age from two years old to 86 years old, according to the forum and the Israeli government press office.
Israel will also release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in the first part of the agreement.
The ceasefire delivered a reprieve for the people of Gaza, after more than 15 months of Israeli bombing following the October 7 attacks.
Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians on Monday began returning home to northern Gaza, large swathes of which have been razed by more than a year of relentless airstrikes and ground raids.
Freed hostages spent over eight months in tunnels, says Israeli officer
The most recent hostages to be released from captivity were four female Israeli soldiers freed on January 25.
Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, all 20 years old, and Liri Albag, 19, were in stable condition, the hospital director of the Israeli facility where they received treatment told CNN on Saturday.
Israel had expected female civilian Arbel Yehud to be released and delayed the opening of a corridor to northern Gaza after she was not included.
On Monday, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad released a new video of Yehud, in which she refers to previous hostage releases – an apparent sign the footage was taken recently.
The video’s release comes amid intense Israeli pressure on Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, who have now said they will release her on Thursday, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office.
Yehud’s family has asked the media not to publish the video.
Several of the seven hostages released from Gaza in the past week had been held in tunnels for more than eight months, according to a senior Israeli military officer.
All seven women released so far showed symptoms of mild starvation with low vitamin levels, said Avi Benov, the deputy chief of the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps. Their mental health, he said, was a very complicated issue.
The former hostages were given vitamins and modest amounts of food during their first medical check-up at Israel’s Re’im military base, the officer said. They were asked if they wanted to shower and change clothes before meeting their parents and were reassured they were safe, he added.
Benov claimed that Hamas had fed them better and allowed them to wash and change clothes in the days before their release, for propaganda purposes.
He said the younger hostages were in better shape, adding that when the older captives start returning they will probably be in worse condition, having spent more than a year in captivity.
Benov declined to answer a question about whether there were physical signs the hostages were tortured. “They will tell their own stories,” he said.","['Lauren Izso', 'Dana Karni', 'Tim Lister']",en

Israel opened a corridor into the north of the Gaza Strip on Monday, 48 hours later than initially planned. It blamed the delay on Hamas, saying the militant group breached the terms of the ceasefire agreement that guaranteed people would be able to return to the north.
Israel expected Hamas to free Arbel Yehud, a female civilian hostage, in the second round of hostage releases on Saturday. When it didn’t, Israel delayed the opening of the Netzarim corridor that bisects the strip, refusing to let people into northern Gaza. Hamas then agreed to release more hostages, including Yehud, on Thursday and Saturday, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said Sunday.
Israel said Yehud should have been released on Saturday as Hamas is obliged to release civilians first. The four hostages released over the weekend were all female members of the Israeli military.
More than 300,000 displaced Palestinians have returned to the northern Gaza Strip since Israel reopened the corridor, according to the Government Media Office in Gaza.
Seen from above, the crowds on Monday resembled a huge, slow moving wave making its way up Gaza’s coast, then turning inland. Most, including children, injured people and the elderly, were traveling on foot, carrying the little they have left on their backs. Most have spent many months exiled in makeshift refugee camps after Israeli forces ordered large-scale evacuations. They had been praying for this moment for months.
One woman told CNN her son was going to see his home – Gaza City – for the first time.
“He was born in Khan Younis. It’s an indescribable feeling that I am going back to Gaza City. It used to take us 10 minutes to get there, but this time it took a year and a half,” she said, adding that she would “kiss the walls and the ground” upon her return.
“May this be the end of the war, and may the ceasefire last… I gave birth in Khan Younis, and my husband is missing,” she said.
Many people have been waiting for weeks for this moment, spending the past few days sitting out in the streets or on the beach with their mattresses, belongings and water tanks, waiting for the checkpoint to open.
Eyad Al Masri, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, told CNN he was detained by Israel when fleeing the north and spent 75 days in Israeli prisons. He said one of his sons has been killed in the war and another one has been missing since February.
“I have no money or anything,” he said in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, while dismantling the tent his family has been living in. “I’m taking these four bags and going back to my house. I don’t know if it is still standing or not; I am going back to Beit Hanoun.”
Nadia Qassem, from Al-Shati Refugee Camp, told CNN, “we have been waiting for this day for so long.”
“We want to return home… Even though my house is destroyed. I miss my land and my place,” she said.
But the return home will likely be marked by more heartbreak.
“I’m going home, but I wish I weren’t,” Saadiya AbdulAl told CNN while traveling to north with an overflowing donkey cart. “My children are gone, and we are all devastated. None of my family members are left; they all became martyrs in Gaza City. Who do I go back to? I have no house and no one,” she said.
Gaza City, where most of the people making this journey on Monday had been living before the war, is among the most destroyed areas in the strip. There are no fully functioning hospitals or schools in the area and access to water, power and basic supplies is extremely limited, despite aid flows into Gaza increasing since the ceasefire came into effect.
The Israeli military said residents could return on foot along the Al Rasheed coastal road, while vehicle traffic can pass via the inland Salah al-Din road after inspection.
The Al Rasheed coastal road was damaged during the war and remains difficult to pass in some places. At some points, people visibly struggled to get through, with wheelchairs and strollers getting stuck in the deep sand.
Subhiyeh Mohammad was walking bent forward, dragging a small bundle made of a blanket through the dirt behind her. “Our children are gone, our husbands are gone, our homes are destroyed. I can’t carry much; I’m a dialysis patient. I only took what I sleep on,” the elderly woman told CNN.
Armed fighters from the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing, were seen among the civilians, wearing their distinct green headbands. Some of those walking past cheered, some posed for photos with the masked fighters.
“We will continue to firmly enforce the ceasefires in the north and south,” Defense Minister Israel Katz wrote in a post on X. “Anyone who violates the rules or threatens (the Israel Defense Forces) will bear the full cost.”
Hamas in a statement praised the return of the displaced as “a victory for our people, and a declaration of the failure and defeat of the occupation and its displacement plans.”
Israel’s far-right former national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who quit in protest over the ceasefire and hostage release deal, claimed the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza was a “total surrender.”
Fragile truce threatened by tensions
Escalated tensions over Yehud’s release had threatened to derail the already fragile truce.
They heightened further on Saturday after President Donald Trump said he had discussed his plan to “clean out” Gaza with the king of Jordan and intended to raise the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
The US president said he would like both Jordan and Egypt – which borders Gaza – to house hundreds of thousands of Palestinians either temporarily or “long term,” telling reporters onboard Air Force One, “because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess.”
“It’s literally a demolition site right now,” Trump said of Gaza. “I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.”
Both Jordan and Egypt rejected Trump’s idea to shift Palestinians out of the enclave, saying such a move would displace Palestinians from their homeland. Trump’s comments were also strongly condemned by Palestinian leaders and human rights groups, who denounced the forced relocation of residents as ethnic cleansing and a possible war crime.
Trump’s comments appear to break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
Dana Stroul, former assistant deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, told CNN that Trump’s proposal “feeds this narrative” that what Israel and the US really want “is not a Palestinian state living next to Israel, but actually to force them somewhere else.”
Specter of further mass displacement
Trump’s idea to ultimately move Gaza’s residents to another country has only raised fears of further mass displacement among Palestinians.
The Palestinian Presidency said the plan “constitutes a blatant violation of red lines Palestinian leadership have consistently warned about.”
“The Palestinian people will never abandon their lands or their Holy Sites, and will not allow the repetition of the Nakba of 1948 and Naksa 1967,” the presidency said.
The movement of Palestinian refugees out of Gaza would evoke painful memories of the mass displacement that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of the 700,000 people who were expelled or fled their homes during the Nakba, or catastrophe.
Hundreds of thousands more were displaced during the 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt.
There are fears that if carried out, Trump’s plan would bring an end to any future prospect of Palestinian-Israeli peace based on a two-state solution.
Hamas in a statement said it will “categorically reject any plans to deport and displace them from their land,” and called on the US administration to “stop these proposals.”
Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad also condemned Trump’s “reprehensible statements” and called the proposal “a continuation of the policy of denying the existence of the Palestinian people, their will and their rights.”
Human rights groups have also denounced the idea.
Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine Director Omar Shakir said in a post on X that it “would amount to an alarming escalation in the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and exponentially increase their suffering.”","['Helen Regan', 'Lucas Lilieholm', 'Abeer Salman', 'Ivana Kottasová']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/middleeast/trump-clean-out-gaza-middle-east-intl/index.html,Trump wants to ‘clean out’ Gaza. Here’s what this could mean for the Middle East,2025-01-27 17:13:20,"US President Donald Trump’s proposal to “clean out” the Gaza Strip by moving more than a million Palestinians to neighboring countries has drawn sharp criticism, with opponents condemning it as ethnic cleansing and warning of regional chaos.
Trump said on Saturday that he would like Jordan and Egypt to take in Gazans internally displaced by Israel’s devastating war in the enclave. “You’re talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One.
The potential transfer, he said, “could be temporary” or “could be long-term.” Both countries swiftly rejected the idea.
But, if adopted, the proposal would mark a sharp break from the Biden administration’s stance that Gaza should not be depopulated and could signal a shift from a longstanding US position that Gaza should be part of a future Palestinian state. It would also align the Trump administration with Israel’s most radical far-right politicians, who advocate transferring Palestinians out of the territory to make way for Jewish settlement.
Trump’s proposal has been embraced by extremist Israeli politicians, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich – who has sparked controversy by claiming there is “no such thing as a Palestinian people”– and former Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, who was once convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism.
Palestinian politicians decried it as a plan to ethnically cleanse Gazans from their land.
And in the United States, even Senator Lindsey Graham – one of Israel’s most ardent supporters in Congress – told CNN in an interview he didn’t believe the idea was “overly practical.”
“I don’t know what he’s talking about,” Graham said, referring to Trump.
Experts warn that beyond the moral and legal concerns, an influx of refugees into neighboring Arab countries could destabilize them and pose an existential threat. Agreeing to Trump’s proposal, they say, would provoke widespread public anger – an untenable risk for those governments.
‘A second Palestinian Nakba’
“If they were to… accept being participants in and hosting Palestinians in an ethnic cleansing, that would undoubtedly be infuriating and genuinely destabilizing for both countries,” Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC, told CNN.
Both the Egyptian and Jordanian governments “would be met by sweeping domestic opposition if they were seen by their publics as being complacent with a second Palestinian Nakba,” said Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, referring to 1948, when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forcibly expelled from their homes in historic Palestine, during the creation of Israel.
Israel has barred them and their descendants from returning, leaving millions of refugees in neighboring countries without citizenship or prospects for permanent resettlement.
“Given that the Palestinians of Gaza are highly unlikely to leave voluntarily, a forced displacement towards Egypt or Jordan would pose a variety of existential threats to these two countries,” Alhasan said.
For Jordan, which is already home to millions of Palestinians, an altered demographic “would threaten the Hashemite monarchy’s hold on power,” he said, adding that financially, “neither Egypt nor Jordan can afford to host millions of additional refugees.”
Egypt and Jordan are two of the US’ closest allies in the Middle East, and major recipients of US aid that have for decades aligned their regional policies with US interests. They were the first Arab countries to sign peace treaties with Israel and have maintained cordial relations with it, including security coordination, despite widespread public discontent.
Jane Kinninmont, an expert on conflict at the European Leadership Network, a think tank, and co-host of the Disorder podcast, said that over time, Jordan and Egypt’s influence in Washington, DC has been overshadowed by Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. What remains to be seen, she added, is how far those countries will go in “sending a clear message to Washington that mass displacement won’t make the conflict go away.”
“It is important for regional countries to emphasize that the refugee issue is one of the drivers of the current conflict and making more Palestinians into refugees won’t solve that. This goes right to the heart of the conflict,” Kinninmont said.
Security concerns
On Sunday, both Egypt and Jordan reaffirmed their rejection to the deportation or resettlement of Palestinians.
“Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians,” said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in a news conference in Amman Sunday. “Our rejection for the deportation is steadfast and unchanging.”
Egypt’s foreign ministry also said it rejects “the deportation or encouragement of the transfer or removal of Palestinians from their land.”
Throughout the war, Jordan and Egypt have brushed off domestic calls to sever ties with Israel, and Egypt has played a key mediation role between Israel and Hamas.
In October 2023, protests erupted in both countries in support of Palestinians in Gaza, with many showing disgruntlement with their governments’ cooperation with Israel given the high human toll Israel’s war had taken.
Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute, said that accepting a Palestinian population transfer would be more costly for the two countries than losing the American aid both countries rely on.
Egypt and Jordan already host a sizeable number of refugees.
As of January, there were 877,000 refugees and asylum-seekers registered in Egypt, according to the UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency. In May, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, Diab al-Louh, has said as many as 100,000 Gazans had crossed into Egypt since the war began, according to Reuters.
In Jordan, more than 2.39 million Palestine refugees are registered with UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, the agency said.
Both countries may also have security concerns if their territories become staging grounds for attacks on Israel, said Alhasan. That could further strain their peace treaties with Israel, he said.
“By seeking to depopulate Gaza of its Palestinian inhabitants, Trump… is doing the bidding of Israel’s extreme right-wing fanatics,” Alhasan said.
“Ironically, Trump’s proposal, if it were to materialize, would in fact be self-defeating,” he said. Destabilizing Egypt and Jordan would “favor Islamist political forces, notably the Muslim Brotherhood,” and these would “prove far less friendly to the US and more sympathetic to Hamas.”",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

Trump said he asked Jordan’s Abdullah II, a key US partner in the region, to take in more Palestinians in a Saturday phone call.
“I said to him that I’d love you to take on more, because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Jordan’s state news agency, Petra, reported the call with Trump, but made no mention of relocating Palestinians. The kingdom is already home to more than 2.39 million registered Palestinian refugees, according to the UN.
Trump said he would like both Jordan and Egypt — which borders the battered enclave — to house people, and that he would speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi about the matter Sunday.
Trump, who noted there have been centuries-long conflicts in the region, said Saturday, “You’re talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.”
He continued: “I don’t know, something has to happen, but it’s literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything’s demolished, and people are dying there, so I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.”
The president, a former property developer, said the potential housing “could be temporary” or “could be long term.”
Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a Sunday statement that it rejects any forced displacement of Palestinians. The ministry did not specifically mention Trump, but reiterated Egypt’s position against “the displacement of Palestinians from their land through forced eviction.”
“Such actions threaten stability, risk extending the conflict further in the region, and undermine opportunities for peace and coexistence,” the statement continued.
Jordan is committed to “ensuring that Palestinians remain on their land,” its minister of foreign affairs said in a statement Sunday.
“Our refusal of displacement is a steadfast position that will not change,” Ayman Safadi said. “Jordan is for Jordanians, and Palestine is for Palestinians.”
Safadi said that he looks forward to working with the new US administration and that Trump was “clear in stating that he wants to achieve peace in the region.”
The minister also reiterated Jordan’s “firm and unchanging” position favoring a two-state solution. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry, in its statement, also called on the international community to support reaching a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Amit Segal, an analyst with Israeli network Channel 12 News, cited Israeli officials and reported Trump’s move was “not a slip of the tongue but part of a much broader move than it seems, coordinated with Israel.”
A source familiar with the matter confirmed the reporting to CNN but gave no further details. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.
Trump’s comments come 15 months into the war between Israel and Hamas, which has reduced much of Gaza to rubble. Israeli airstrikes have damaged or destroyed around 60% of buildings, including schools and hospitals, and around 92% of homes, according to the UN.
Approximately 90% of Gaza residents have been displaced, and many have been forced to move repeatedly, some more than 10 times, according to the UN.
Trump’s comments appear to break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
There has long been a fear in the region that Israel wants to push Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries — a premise Israel rejects but one supported by far-right factions of its governing coalition.
El-Sisi criticized Israel’s move to evacuate more than a million residents from northern Gaza in October 2023, characterizing it as part of a larger plan to rid the entire area of Palestinians.
“The displacement or expulsion of Palestinians from the (Gaza) Strip into Egypt simply means that a similar situation will also take place — namely the expulsion of Palestinians from the West Bank to Jordan,” Sisi said, adding there would be no point in discussing a Palestinian state, as “the land will be there, but the people won’t.”
Around the same time, King Abdullah called the idea of more Palestinian refugees moving to Jordan or Egypt a “red line.”
Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said Palestinians “will not accept any proposals or solutions” from Trump on leaving their homeland, even if they are “seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.”
Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, said he “completely rejected” Trump’s comments.
“What the occupation has failed to achieve through its criminal bombardment and genocide in Gaza will not be implemented through political pressures,” Barghouti said in a statement, adding, “The conspiracy of ethnic cleansing will not succeed in Gaza or the West Bank.”
There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of people who fled with the creation of Israel in 1948.
Upon taking office Monday, Trump rescinded Biden-era sanctions against Israeli settlers deemed responsible for deadly violence in the occupied West Bank, in a move welcomed by Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who has argued strenuously for Israel to reestablish Jewish settlements in Gaza abandoned under an Israeli order in 2005.
Smotrich quickly endorsed Trump’s latest comments, saying, “the idea of helping (Gazans) find other places to start new, better lives is a great idea.”
Trump said earlier in the week that he “might” be able to have a role in rebuilding Gaza, praising it as having a “phenomenal location, on the sea” and “the best weather.”
The comments echoed remarks made in 2024 by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who called the waterfront property in Gaza “very valuable” and suggested Israel should move Palestinians out of Gaza and “clean it up.”
Trump also confirmed he had lifted a Biden-era hold on the provision of 2,000-pound bombs for Israel.
“We released them today and they’ll have them. They paid for them and they’ve been waiting for them for a long time,” he told reporters.

The deaths come as a deadline expired Sunday for Israel to withdraw forces from the area, as part of a ceasefire agreement that ended months of conflict with Hezbollah.
Under the November ceasefire agreement, both Israeli and Hezbollah forces agreed to withdraw from southern Lebanon by January 26, the end of a 60-day period stipulated in the deal.
But Israel’s government said Friday that the military would not withdraw all of its forces from southern Lebanon by Sunday’s deadline, blaming Lebanon for failing to uphold its end of the agreement. The Lebanese army in turn accused Israel of “procrastination.”
Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said the Israeli military launched attacks on Lebanese citizens on Sunday attempting to enter towns still occupied by Israeli forces.
Of those killed, one was a soldier “targeted by gunfire from the Israeli enemy,” the Lebanese army said.
Video verified by CNN showed residents on foot in Kfar Kila, southern Lebanon, trying to return to their villages. Some were seen carrying Hezbollah flags, while others held images of militant fighters killed in the war.
It comes after Israel’s military issued a fresh order on Sunday to residents of dozens of southern Lebanese villages not to return to their homes.
“Urgent!! A new reminder to the residents of southern Lebanon: Until further notice you are prohibited from moving south to the line of villages and their surroundings,” Avichay Adraee, Arabic-language spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), wrote on X.
The post included a map of southern Lebanon with an area along the border with Israel shaded red and a list of more than 60 villages residents were prohibited from accessing.
“The Defense Forces do not intend to target you and therefore at this stage you are prohibited from returning to your homes from this line south until further notice. Anyone who moves south of this line puts themselves at risk,” Adraee said.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops operating in southern Lebanon “fired warning shots to remove threats in a number of areas where suspects were identified approaching the troops.”
The Israeli military added it had apprehended numerous suspects for questioning, claiming they posed and “imminent threat to the troops.”
Lebanon’s president Joseph Aoun said he was “monitoring this issue at the highest levels” in a statement.
“Lebanon’s sovereignty and the unity of its territory are not subject to compromise,” he said and promised residents of the south he would “ensure your rights and dignity.”
The United Nations called on both sides to urgently recommit to the agreement while its peacekeeping force said it was deploying to areas in southern Lebanon at the request of the Lebanese army.
The president of France, Emmanuel Macron urged Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to withdraw his remaining forces from Lebanon in a phone call on Sunday, according to the French President’s office. France played a key role in brokering the ceasefire deal alongside the US last November.","['Charbel Mallo', 'Lucas Lilieholm', 'Caitlin Danaher', 'Jomana Karadsheh']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/25/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-fragile-hostage-release-gaza-intl-latam/index.html,Hamas and Israel trade blame over deal violations. Will the fragile ceasefire and hostage agreement hold?,2025-01-25 21:00:42,"The fragility of the truce between Israel and Hamas was laid bare on Saturday, after Israel accused Hamas of withholding a hostage, prompting a halt in the movement of Gazan civilians back to their homes in the north.
The ceasefire deal was already a brittle agreement, with Israeli statements often calling it a “framework” as opposed to a deal.
Tensions escalated this week when 29-year-old Arbel Yehud, a civilian who Israel says should have been freed Saturday, was not among the four women released. Israel, in turn, did not allow Gazan civilians to return north past the Netzarim Corridor, which was meant to take place Saturday under the ceasefire and hostage deal.
Complicating the matter is that Yehud is not being held by Hamas. A senior source in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement (PIJ), another militant group in the Strip, told CNN that it is holding Yehud and that she “will be released under the terms of the agreed-upon prisoner exchange deal.”
Both Hamas and Israel have accused the other of failing to stick to their end of the bargain, raising questions about how well the ceasefire that took more than 15 months to reach would hold.
“This is a very delicate matter,” Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who used to speak to Hamas through backchannels, told CNN.
Baskin explained that Hamas “will not give anything for free,” in reference to Yehud’s captivity. He added that “Israel’s threat not to allow the displaced to move north” does little to convince Hamas to help push for her release.
The former negotiator warned that “carrying out the threat” of not allowing displaced Palestinians to move north “could lead to a halt in the release of the hostages” and advised Israel to try to keep the deal alive.
“It is better for Israel to talk less and let the mediators do more,” Baskin added, urging Israel to “convey to Qatar and Egypt that it is ready to adopt the three-week deal that Hamas agreed to in September.
‘How will the US respond?’
Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Saturday that “Hamas didn’t fulfil the agreement in terms of its obligation to return civilians first,” adding that “we will insist that Arbel Yehud return” along with the rest of the hostages.
Hundreds of displaced people were seen fleeing in panic after the Israeli military opened fire on Saturday to prevent them from crossing into northern Gaza to return to their homes, CNN footage showed. The Israeli military said it was ‘unaware of any harm’ after its troops fired ‘warning shots in order to distance’ a crowd in Gaza.
Hamas said that Israel “continues to procrastinate in implementing the terms of the ceasefire agreement and the prisoner exchange by maintaining the closure of al-Rasheed Street and preventing the return of displaced persons walking from the south to the north.”
The Palestinian militant group added that it holds Israel “responsible for any delays in the implementation of the agreement and the repercussions that may arise on the remaining phases.”
There are questions as to how the United States under President Donald Trump would respond to the violations alleged by both sides.
An Israeli official told CNN Saturday that Israel asked the Trump administration to push on Hamas to abide by the terms of the deal and free Yehud. The message was sent to Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, the official added. CNN has reached out to Trump administration for comment.
The ceasefire “framework,” as Israel refers to it, “was hardly ironclad from the get-go,” Dr H.A. Hellyer, senior associate fellow at Center for American Progress and the Royal United Services Institute, told CNN.
“The question is now, after clear violations by the Israelis, how will the US respond? Will they use pressure to ensure adherence, or are we seeing the breakdown of this pause in hostilities so soon after the signing?” Hellyer said.
A choreographed show of force
Tensions simmered as the second exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners took place. The militant group used it to choreograph a poignant show of force despite Israel’s warnings.
Propaganda video released by Hamas after the four Israeli hostages were freed showed the women paraded before a crowd as they received certificates for their release and souvenir keychains. CNN does not know the circumstances under which the hostages were speaking, including whether they were speaking under duress.
In the nearly three-minute video, the four women are seen seated inside a van, smiling and posing. The women were seen thanking Hamas’ military wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, “for the good treatment,” including for providing food and water. They also thanked them for “protecting” them from shelling.
None of the four women are native Arabic speakers. In the video, they can be heard speaking in Hebrew accents.
Hamas’ propaganda videos have left a sour note over the years. Previous Hamas’ videos of the four soldiers’ kidnapping by Hamas on October 7, 2023 had gone viral. The women were dressed in civilian clothes at the time of their taking, including pajamas when they were pulled from their bedrooms. Videos showed them covered in blood.
Experts say that deals like this are bound to be filled with complications, especially as Hamas tries to use what leverage it has over Israel, and as Israel tries to retrieve hostages while destroying the group.
Yohanan Tzoreff, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said concerns about violations, delays, or crises come with “any deal with an organization like Hamas.”
Such concerns “are rooted in the many past grievances between the two sides, numerous bloody conflicts, and, of course, the heinous attack carried out by Hamas on October 7,” Tzoreff said.
“The issue of hostage release became a test for both sides,” he said, adding that Israel “finds itself facing a dilemma: how to secure the hostages’ release while fully achieving the second goal of dismantling Hamas.”","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Dana Karni']",en

Following their release, Israel has released 200 Palestinian prisoners from detention centers, including 121 prisoners who had been sentenced to life imprisonment.
The four hostages freed Saturday – Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, all 20 years old, and Liri Albag, 19 – had been held in Gaza since the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023.
All four are in a stable condition, according Dr. Lena Koren Feldman, the director of Beilinson Hospital, where the women are being assessed.
Hamas militants took the women, dressed in makeshift military uniforms, on stage in Palestine Square in Gaza City before handing them to the Red Cross. They appeared elated as they waved to the crowds, with Israelis visibly emotional as they watched the live pictures in Hostages Square, Tel Aviv.
Hamas put on show of force during the handover, waving green flags and displaying a poster of current and former Israeli leaders alongside the word “failure,” in what seemed to be a message to Israeli that it remained powerful despite being battered by the Gaza offensive.
Soon after the releases, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said that civilians in Gaza would not be allowed to move to their homes in northern Gaza as planned – because an Israeli female civilian due to be released Saturday was not among those freed.
Israel has been pushing for the release of Arbel Yehud, 29, who was kidnapped from her home in kibbutz Nir Oz. Israel says she is a civilian and should have been released Saturday.
Israel asked the administration of US President Donald Trump to press Hamas to abide by the terms of the deal and free Yehud, an Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN Saturday.
Israel conveyed the message to Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, the official added. CNN has reached out to the Trump administration for comment.
A senior source in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement (PIJ) told CNN on Saturday that it holds Yehud, claiming she was a soldier and “was being held captive by (the PIJ’s military wing) al-Quds Brigades as a trained soldier in the Israeli army’s space program.” There is no evidence that Yehud has had such a role.
A second PIJ source outside Gaza told CNN that Yehud was alive.
An Israeli official confirmed to CNN that the Israeli military would not allow Gazan civilians to cross into the north until Yehud was in the hands of Israel or until the process of her release starts.
Israeli military fires towards Palestinians attempting to return home
Hundreds of displaced people hoping to return to their homes in the north fled in panic after the Israeli military opened fire to prevent them from crossing into northern Gaza, CNN footage shows.
The Israeli military had warned people earlier in the day that they could not travel north past the Netzarim Corridor – which divides the territory – as planned, saying that Hamas had failed to release Yehud during the latest hostage release.
In anticipation of being allowed to return, scores of families had gathered at Al Rasheed street – the coastal road to the north. But amid gunfire they scattered, many ducking to the ground. It is unclear whether there were any casualties.
The Israeli military said its troops “only fired warning shots” after they identified dozens of “suspects that posed a threat to the forces.”
“We emphasize that, as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused to the suspects as a result of the shooting,” it added.
IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari earlier said the four hostages released Saturday had been reunited with their families. The family of Daniella Gilboa expressed their joy at her release from Gaza.
“We just want to hug her, to see her and hug her. And to say to her that she is safe now and everybody is waiting for her,” Gilboa’s aunt, Dekele Sherabi, told CNN.
After reuniting with family, the four soldiers were transported from Re’im in southern Israel to Beilinson hospital, arriving in two separate military helicopters. A few hundred Israelis gathered around the helipad near the hospital to receive them.
A white curtain was raised for the hostages’ privacy as they moved from the helicopters to the vans that would carry them inside the medical facility.
Emotional scenes as Palestinian prisoners are released
The Israeli prison service confirmed Saturday that 200 Palestinian prisoners had been released from detention facilities as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal.
They included 121 prisoners who had been sentenced to life imprisonment. Among them were Mohammad Odeh, Wael Qassim and Wissam Abbasi, who were arrested in 2002 for a string of deadly bombings targeting Israelis in crowded civilian areas. All three were serving life sentences for their involvement in the attacks.
According to a list published by the Palestinian Prisoners Office and the Palestinian Prisoners Society, nearly half of the released prisoners are men in their 20s and 30s. Two children – both 15 years old – were also freed, according to the list.
The documents do not mention on what grounds the individuals were detained but did list party affiliation – including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group.
Most of the Palestinians who were freed were transported to the occupied West Bank but 70 of the detainees considered to be dangerous by Israel are being deported outside of Israel and Palestinian territories, according to the Israeli prison service.
Emotional scenes played out in the streets of Ramallah, in the West Bank, following the prisoners’ release.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-withdrawal-intl/index.html,Israel says it won’t withdraw from Lebanon by Sunday deadline,2025-01-24 08:51:37,"The Israeli government says its military will not withdraw from Lebanon by Sunday’s deadline, in violation of a ceasefire agreement that ended months of conflict with Hezbollah.
Israel was expected to withdraw all of its forces from southern Lebanon as part of the deal but the Israeli government said some its forces would remain in southern Lebanon, blaming Lebanon for failing to uphold its end of the agreement.
“The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) withdrawal is conditional upon the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. “Since the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by Lebanon, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the United States.”
US National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said on Friday the United States was working with partners on a “short” and “temporary” extension of the ceasefire.
A Lebanese security source told CNN on Friday it had not received official notice of Israel’s plans to keep their forces in Lebanon beyond the 60-day ceasefire grace period.
Under the November ceasefire agreement, both Israeli and Hezbollah forces agreed to withdraw from southern Lebanon by January 26, the end of a 60-day period stipulated in the deal.
Hezbollah warned on Thursday that if the Israeli military remained in Lebanon past Sunday, it would be “considered a brazen breach of the agreement.”
The Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon on October 1 – the culmination of a yearlong, low-level war with Hezbollah, which attacked Israeli-held territory on October 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas.
The Israeli government had told US President Donald Trump’s administration that it wanted Israeli troops to remain in Lebanon for at least an additional 30 days, an Israeli official told CNN. The Israeli security cabinet met Thursday night to discuss the issue.
“All parties share the goal of ensuring Hezbollah does not have the ability to threaten the Lebanese people or their neighbors,” the US National Security Council spokesperson said, adding, “To achieve these goals, a short, temporary ceasefire extension is urgently needed.”
“We are pleased that the IDF has started the withdrawal from the central regions, and we continue to work closely with our regional partners to finalize the extension,” he added.
Michael Herzog, Israel’s ambassador in Washington, told Israel’s Army Radio on Thursday that a 60-day deadline set out in a November ceasefire agreement “is not set in stone.”
An Israeli official who described Israel’s request to the US said Israel has requested a 30-day extension and has said it would re-assess the viability of withdrawing from southern Lebanon at the end of that extension. The official said all of the outposts Israel has asked to maintain are alongside the Israel-Lebanon border.
Under the deal, the Lebanese military and UN peacekeepers will be the only forces allowed in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah must pull its forces north of Lebanon’s Litani River – a frontier beyond which the militant group was not supposed to have advanced under a 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution.
“That is not yet the case,” Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said of Hezbollah’s withdrawal and the Lebanese military’s deployment in a briefing Thursday. “There is movement, but it is not moving fast enough.”
Hezbollah warned on Thursday that an Israeli breach of the agreement would require the Lebanese state “to deal with it by every means at its disposal afforded to it by international treaties in order to retrieve the land and snatch it from the clutches of occupation.”
US sees ‘a very positive path’
There has for some time been speculation in Israel that the government would seek to change the terms of its ceasefire with Hezbollah once Trump took office.
The exact situation in southern Lebanon is decidedly opaque. The Israeli military has spent these past months of the ceasefire feverishly destroying Hezbollah weapons and military infrastructure and leveling several Lebanese villages near the border. Hezbollah’s military posture is unclear.
The clearest picture has been painted by the US military, which together with the French government and the United Nations is monitoring the ceasefire.
US Major General Jasper Jeffers, who leads the American effort, said after a trip to southern Lebanon last week that Lebanese military “checkpoints and patrols operate effectively throughout south-west Lebanon.” He said that the belligerents were “on a very positive path to continue the withdrawal of the IDF as planned.”
Earlier this month, Lebanon’s parliament elected Joseph Aoun, supported by the US and formerly the military chief, as president. It ended more than two years of stalemate that had resulted in a presidential vacuum. The election was brought about by a robust Saudi effort to rally the necessary support for Aoun.
In his acceptance speech, viewed as a blueprint for a six-year tenure, Aoun vowed to monopolize weapons under the mandate of the state. It was an earth-shattering promise, marking a clear break with the decades-old unwritten policy to preserve Hezbollah’s militant wing which has de facto been tasked with facing off against Israeli forces.
The American optimism over the ceasefire is not shared by many civilians from northern Israel, who have been slow to return to communities emptied by war. Residents of Kiryat Shmona are set to demonstrate against the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon on Sunday.
“Most communities are still empty,” Sarit Zehavi, who runs the Alma Research and Education Center, which specializes in security issues in northern Israel. “People want to come back.”
There is a widespread fear in northern Israel, she said, that military withdrawal will give Hezbollah carte blanche to deploy close to Israel’s border, under the nose of the Lebanese military.
“The Lebanese army is far from disarming Hezbollah,” she said. “We are very worried what will happen if the IDF fully withdraws and the IDF enforcement will stop, because we don’t see the Lebanese army doing anything.”","['Mick Krever', 'Jeremy Diamond']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/middleeast/jenin-israeli-military-operation-west-bank-intl-latam/index.html,Residents say they were forced to flee Jenin refugee camp as Israel’s West Bank military operation intensifies,2025-01-24 00:00:00,"The sound of gunfire and explosions filled the air as residents of the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank hauled their belongings down the muddy pathway.
Smoke billowed from multiple areas in the camp’s Al-Hadaf neighborhood, while a bulldozer razed a building in the distance and Israeli military convoys drove past nearby.
Several of the residents fleeing the camp told CNN the Israeli military had ordered them to evacuate and they did not know when they would be allowed to return home.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) insisted to CNN Friday it was “not forcing the Palestinians to evacuate,” but said it had “allowed residents of the camp to evacuate between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. today through an organized and secured point.”
Either way, the men, women, children and elderly trudging through the mud-soaked pathways said they had no choice but to flee the camp, a sprawling area of narrow alleys that has long been a bastion of militant factions and is now front and center of the IDF’s Operation “Iron Wall.”
Israel launched the operation two days after the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire began, saying it was aimed at eliminating “terrorists and terror infrastructure” and “ensuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over – the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza.”
On Friday, the Israeli military said it had killed “more than 10 terrorists, arrested about 20 wanted individuals, and confiscated many other weapons and ammunition” during its operation in Jenin.
But rights groups have raised concerns that fleeing civilians have been caught in the crossfire.
Some of those now fleeing the camp said Israeli drones carrying loudspeakers had ordered them to leave, then guided them out.
Mousa Al-Sharaa, 45, fled Thursday with his elderly mother, who he had to carry at times as they left the camp on foot.
The streets were empty as they left and the Israeli army was “spread around everywhere,” he said.
Some residents said the military had told them they could return in seven days. Others said troops had told them they could not return at all.
Asked if he would return, Al-Sharaa said soldiers had warned him against the idea.
“They told us: don’t come back, we’ll make a boom out of the whole camp,” he said.
Khawla Asaad, 55, who was born in the camp, said she had evacuated four days ago amid heavy gunfire and was now staying with a friend nearby.
There had been no water or electricity for days before she left, she said, adding that most other people had left too.
Jenin governor Kamal Abu Al-Roub told CNN Thursday the camp was now nearly empty, that water had been cut off and the area was “under siege.”
As the Israeli operation continued into its fourth day, Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesman for the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights, said the commission was deeply concerned by the “use of unlawful lethal force” in Jenin, including “multiple airstrikes and apparently random shooting at unarmed residents attempting to flee or find safety.”
The UNHCR said it had verified that at least 12 Palestinians had been killed and 40 injured by Israeli security forces since Tuesday, most of them reportedly unarmed.
Elsewhere in the West Bank, the UN said, Israeli security forces had “shut down entrances to major Palestinian cities such as Hebron, closed checkpoints, and initiated long, individual searches of vehicles at those that remained open.”
In 2002, the Israeli military occupied the camp after 10 days of intensive fighting, according to the UN, during which time more than 400 houses were destroyed and over a quarter of the camp’s population was displaced.","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Nada Bashir', 'Kareem Khadder']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages-ceasefire-release-intl/index.html,Israel receives names of four female hostages Hamas is due to release Saturday,2025-01-24 15:24:42,"Israel is preparing to receive four female soldiers held by Hamas on Saturday, in the latest release of captives under the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.
The militant group said Friday that it intends to release Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy – all 20 years old – and Liri Albag, 19.
Israeli officials have told the families of the four women that they intend to move forward with the release – despite Israel previously expecting Arbel Yehud, a female civilian hostage still held in Gaza, to be included in Saturday’s release.
Israel had demanded that Hamas release Yehud, a 29-year-old who was taken hostage from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, as part of the next release, a source familiar with the matter said. She is believed to be held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, not Hamas, which could be a factor in the timing of her release.
Hamas said it expected Israel to release around 200 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday. The Hamas Prisoners Media Office said in a statement on Friday that it expects “120 prisoners with life sentences and 80 prisoners with high sentences” to be released “according to what was stipulated in the ceasefire agreement.”
As part of the agreement, the Israeli government has agreed to release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female soldier hostage released from Gaza.
It was not initially clear on Friday whether Israel would accept the list provided by Hamas, given Yehud’s absence from it. After the government received the list through mediators, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a call with his defense minister and the heads of the country’s negotiation team, an official told CNN.
Later in the day, the families were notified Israel intended for the release to go ahead.
As of Friday evening, Israel’s Justice Ministry was yet to say how many and which Palestinian prisoners will be released on Saturday.
A nation awaits
The four women slated for release were among seven female soldiers kidnapped from the Nahal Oz military base, where they served as Israel Defense Forces (IDF) military lookouts, observing activity inside the Gaza Strip.
One of the seven, Ori Megidish, was rescued by the IDF on October 30, 2023. Another, Noa Marciano, 19, was killed in Gaza. Her body was recovered by the IDF on November 17, 2023.
The remaining five were not released as part of an earlier, short-lived ceasefire deal in 2023, despite the agreement calling for the release of all women and children held captive. The fifth female soldier still held in Gaza is Agam Berger. She is not included on the list for release on Saturday, but she is among the 33 hostages the Israeli government named as set for release during the first phase of the ceasefire that went into effect Sunday morning.
Several videos showing their kidnapping became symbolic of the brutality of the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023.
One piece of footage showed them lined up against a wall, their hands bound, their bodies bruised and bloodied. The video was released by the women’s families in May to put pressure on the Israeli government to secure a deal to have them freed. The IDF admitted at the time that it had failed to defend its personnel at the Nahal Oz base.
Three of the women later appeared in Hamas propaganda videos, pleading for their lives.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said it welcomed the news about the expected release of the four women after 477 days in Hamas captivity, saying that “an entire nation has fought for them and anxiously awaits their longed-for return to their families’ embrace.”
The forum added that it “will not give up or stop at any stage until all hostages return home under the current agreement.”
A smile that ‘brightens the day of everyone’
The four young women slated for release on Saturday were all serving in the IDF as part of their compulsory military service when they were taken hostage by Hamas.
The youngest of the four, Albag, was just 18 years old when she was kidnapped. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum described her as someone who “radiates joy, with a smile and laugh that brightens the day of everyone around her.”
According to her family and friends, Albag is a big fan of singing, photography, and cooking. They said she enjoys traveling, with a list of restaurants she wants to try in every place she visits. They said her dream was to study in Paris and become an interior designer and architect.
Ariev, Gilboa and Levy all turned 20 while in captivity.
Ariev is from Jerusalem and, according to the forum, enjoys dancing, singing, writing, cooking, and makeup. She was described by the forum as someone who “shares the love within her with her family and friends, is sensitive to everything, and always takes care of everyone.”
“She dreams of becoming a psychologist and is known for being compassionate and for bringing people together – serving as the connecting force in both her friendships and family relationships,” the forum said in a statement.
Gilboa is a “passionate musician who studies piano and singing, aspiring to pursue a professional career in music,” the forum said, adding that she is “known for her optimism and kindness.”
Levy, meanwhile, was described by her family and friends as gentle and quiet, yet full of light, joy, strength, and determination. They said Levy competed in triathlons and played tennis. She also took part in the Hands of Peace project, which brings together young Israelis, Palestinians and Americans to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
More releases to come
Three hostages have already been released as part of the first phase of the present ceasefire deal: Emily Damari, 28, Romi Gonen, 24, Doron Steinbrecher, 31, were all freed on Sunday. At the same time, 90 Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel.
The first phase of the ceasefire agreement is expected to last for five more weeks. Under the terms, 30 more Israeli hostages, including the four slated for release on Saturday, and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners should be freed over that time.
Hamas and its allies still hold 91 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023. There are also three additional hostages who have been held captive since 2014 and are still in Gaza. In total, 251 people were taken from Israel on October 7, 2023.
Under the terms of the deal, Israeli troops will withdraw from some parts of Gaza and the amount of humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza will be increased.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Dana Karni', 'Kareem Khadder', 'Jeremy Diamond', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq', 'Eugenia Yosef']",en

The next, they were killed",2025-01-24 14:18:44,"Thirteen-year-old Zakariya Barbakh had spent most of his life shuffling between hospitals across Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Israel.
Born without a lung, he had struggled to breathe. Doctors had predicted he would need a transplant if he were to reach adulthood. But the last 15 months of war in Gaza had made that impossible.
When the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect on Sunday, Zakariya was ecstatic.
“Mom, now we can go look for my lungs!” his mother recalled him saying.
Less than 24 hours later, Zakariya was shot dead.
Doctors at Nasser Hospital say an Israeli sniper fired the fatal shot in the southern city of Rafah on Monday. Zakariya’s family told CNN he had been looking for wood to use for cooking and heating.
“He didn’t die from his disease; he ended up dying at the hands of the occupation. All he wanted was to have lungs to breathe, what did he do to deserve this? What did this child do?” his mother said, unable to hold back tears.
The Israeli military told CNN it was not aware of the incident.
Zakariya is one of at least four Palestinians allegedly shot by the Israeli military since the ceasefire went into effect.
The Israeli military has withdrawn to buffer zones along Gaza’s border, but has warned Palestinians against approaching areas where its troops are still stationed. It has published a map of zones that are “very dangerous” to approach.
But where those zones begin and end is not always as clear on the ground.
“How would he know he would face occupation forces? How would he know he was in the wrong area? All he did was try to find something to eat. He got lost along the way. Can you not see the way this child looks? He looks sick and despairing,” his mother said.
A dramatic video showing the aftermath of the incident was shared widely online. CNN showed Zakariya’s family the video and his parents confirmed it was their son.
The video shows a man trying to drag Zakariya’s lifeless body before he too is shot. The man survived
News that Israel and Hamas had reached a ceasefire deal triggered celebrations across the Strip last Wednesday. But in several areas those celebrations were soon drowned out by the sound of Israeli airstrikes.
In the four days between when the deal was announced and when it went into effect on Sunday morning, Israeli attacks killed at least 142 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense, including dozens of women and children.
Among them were members of 3-year-old As’ad Khalifa’s family.
Less than 24 hours after the ceasefire deal was announced, an Israeli airstrike targeted his home.
As’ad survived, but in an instant, he became an orphan. His parents and sister were killed in the strike.
His next-door neighbor Moutasem Dallou told CNN the strike happened in the middle of the night and “shook the ground beneath.” Pieces of shrapnel had reached Dallou’s home and terrified his young children.
Dallou knew the family as they had been displaced by the war at the same time. He went searching for them under the rubble with other neighbors. Using basic equipment and their bare hands, they were able to uncover and retrieve the dead bodies of the mother and father but the children remained missing.
Before they gave up, they heard the cries of a child and began frantically throwing aside blocks of cement until they reached the source.
After a grueling 30 minutes, they found a small hand reaching out amid the rubble and gripping the air. They were able to pull the child – As’ad – out, roughed up and covered in dust – but alive. His little sister was found dead next to him.
Dallou and his sister Mawada have since taken him in.
“Nearly four hours after the ceasefire announcement, his mother sent us a text message congratulating us for the news. Moments later, she was killed….This child lost his mother and father in mere seconds. Because of the decision of a pilot in the sky, this child lost everything he had in life,” Mawada told CNN.
In a statement to CNN, the Israeli military said it “struck terror infrastructure where a commander in the Hamas terrorist organization …was present. The terrorist was responsible for many rocket attacks.”
“The IDF took intelligence measures to mitigate harm to uninvolved individuals,” the statement added.
Dallou has children of similar age to As’ad, which has helped to integrate him into their family. But he is concerned about how As’ad will grow up.
“I know from my experience with my little daughter that this child is going through a difficult psychological state. They are petrified from any sound now …They start crying for their mother,” he said.
Mawada said that because she knew As’ad’s mother, she would do everything she can to embrace him.
“We will try, but we will not be able to replace his mother or bring her back.”","['Zeena Saifi', 'Jeremy Diamond']",en

Armed personnel from an American security contractor will man the checkpoint and will be responsible for inspecting vehicles entering northern Gaza. Palestinians returning to northern Gaza on foot will not be inspected, according to the terms of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.
Israeli forces are set to complete their withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza on Saturday, which will allow displaced residents of northern Gaza to return to their homes – or what remains of them.
Named after the former Israeli settlement of Netzarim in Gaza, the corridor was constructed by Israeli forces to create a strategic, central road intersecting the strip.
Israeli media have reported that a security contractor named UG Solutions will deploy personnel to the checkpoint. Another American firm, Safe Reach Solutions, is reportedly involved in the planning and logistics for the checkpoint.
Neither firm has an extensive online footprint. On its website, Safe Reach Solutions says it provides “planning, logistics, and strategic expertise to organizations operating in the world’s most complex environments.”
Israel has long mulled various plans to deploy private American contractors to safeguard aid shipments in Gaza or to establish humanitarian zones that have been fully cleared of Hamas militants.
None of those plans has ever come to fruition, but the contractor-manned checkpoint could be a key test of the viability of deploying private contractors in Gaza.
Israeli troops are withdrawing from the corridor in central Gaza after a ceasefire-hostage agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas last week.
The three-phase deal has raised cautious hopes for an end to the war. The first phase will last for six weeks and will see the staggered release of 33 Israeli hostages. In return, Israel is expected to release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
During the first 42-day phase, Israel is due to withdraw from population centers but will retain a presence along Gaza’s borders and on a road dividing the territory.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Rob Picheta']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/middleeast/palestinian-prisoner-released-journalist-horrors-israeli-detention-intl/index.html,Palestinian journalist reunited with child after harrowing months in Israeli jail,2025-01-23 16:22:28,"The female Palestinian inmates were made to kneel in a line on a cold evening last Sunday on the grounds of Israel’s Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank.
“This is not a victory for you. We have destroyed and killed in Gaza, in Yemen, in Syria, in Iran. We killed (your) leadership,” one, Rula Hassanein, recalled hearing in a 90-second Israeli propaganda video they were forced to watch on a large screen ahead of their release.
The women were part of a group of 90 Palestinian prisoners released in a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel. Around nine hours earlier, Hamas had freed three Israeli hostages in Gaza after 15 months of captivity.
Hassanein remembers the video vividly. The prisoners, she said, were made to watch it on loop for hours as Palestinians gathered outside to receive them.
“We were not allowed to look left or right. Only at the screen,” she told CNN. Two other released prisoners also told CNN that they were forced to watch the video.
In an interview with CNN from her home in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Hassanein appeared frail and exhausted. Sitting in her living room, she was surrounded by family photos that had been her toddler’s only connection to her for the past 10 months. She had given birth to her first child just months before her arrest, in March 2024. Hassanein worked as a journalist for local media outlets.
Israeli authorities charged her with incitement on social media, she said.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), court documents accused Hassanein of incitement over posts in 2022 and 2023, including reposts on X and Facebook “in which she commented on the Israel-Gaza war, that included her frustration over the suffering of Palestinians.”
In another post, Hassanein also “commented on events in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including the shooting of two Israelis in the northern town of Huwara in August 2023 and the killing of an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in East Jerusalem in October 2022,” the CPJ said in May.
Her account on X has been suspended and CNN hasn’t been able to access her posts.
Hassanein described her time in prison as filled with abuse and humiliation. She said she was strip searched and verbally abused by Israeli guards, calling the treatment “torture.”
“They would hold us by the head, even slip off large parts of our headscarves, pushing us down to our knees and dragging us while we are bound at our hands and feet with heavy metal irons,” she said.
CNN asked the Israel Prison Service (IPS), the country’s detention authority, about the allegations that prisoners were mistreated and made to watch a propaganda video. The IPS said it wasn’t aware of the allegations “and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility.”
“Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities,” it added.
Hamas is expected to release a total of 33 hostages from Gaza during the 42-day truce. Those released so far have not spoken publicly about their experience in captivity.
As of this month, Israel holds at least 10,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Commission of Detainees’ Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society – though that number does not include an unknown number of Palestinians taken captive in Gaza. The figure of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel includes 3,376 people held under the controversial system of administrative detention, meaning they can remain in prison indefinitely with no public charges against them nor trial. It includes 95 children and 22 women.
A July report by the United Nations stated that detention conditions for Palestinians in Israeli custody “worsened dramatically” after October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, prompting an Israeli offensive on Gaza that has killed more than 47,000 and injured over 100,000 people, according to the health ministry there.
“The Israeli authorities further restricted access to food, water, sanitation and electricity, medical treatment, media and information, family visits and consultation with legal representatives,” the report said. “According to the OHCHR monitoring, there have been regular, at times daily, raids of prison cells, removal of personal items, and limited access to personal hygiene items, including menstrual hygiene.”
‘My daughter forgot what I looked like’
Hassanein described dire conditions in the Israeli prison, where inmates were given little food and were regularly subjected to physical and verbal abuse.
Access to menstrual pads was sometimes at the mercy of male prison guards, she said.
“The guards in detention used to tell us we didn’t have to change our pads every hour, that we could change them every four to five hours,” Hassanein told CNN.
She recalled a woman from Gaza who wasn’t provided a menstrual pad. “We could see blood all over her clothes and she was mocked (by Israeli guards)… it was horrifying.”
Before her arrest, Hassanein had given birth to premature twins. One died hours after her caesarean section. The surviving child, Elia, appeared to have forgotten her mother while Hassanein was in prison.
A video of the mother and child’s reunion on Sunday went viral on social media.
Hassanein said she would often dream of her daughter in prison, but was dismayed when Elia didn’t recognize her initially. “Of course, my daughter forgot what I looked like,” she said.
“I saw her and I hugged her, but she was afraid,” she added. “I am trying, with my husband, to re-enter Elia’s life in a gradual manner, so as not to subject her to an emotional shock.”","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Nada Bashir', 'Abeer Salman']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/middleeast/israel-turning-focus-on-west-bank-intl/index.html,"With Gaza quiet, Israel is turning its focus on the West Bank. Here’s why",2025-01-23 14:45:37,"The Israeli military has intensified operations across the occupied West Bank, targeting Palestinian militant cells, imposing roadblocks and cutting communities off from the outside world.
The sudden expansion of Israeli security operations in the West Bank has killed at least 10 people and follows the start of the delicate ceasefire process in Gaza, by which Israeli hostages are released in stages and will also see the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces.
The move also comes as the Israeli right, and many in the settler movement, feel emboldened by the words of some officials in the Trump administration who have suggested Israel has the right to annex much or all of the West Bank, home to more than three million Palestinians.
What’s happening in the West Bank
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has spoken of a new dynamic in the West Bank, saying the military will adopt tactics learned in the Gaza offensive in its efforts to eradicate militant groups and, in his words, “ensure that terrorism does not return.”
The Jenin refugee camp in the north of the West Bank, a sprawling area of narrow alleys that has long been a bastion of militant factions, is front and center of the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) latest campaign.
Katz said Tuesday that Operation “Iron Wall” would “eliminate terrorists and terror infrastructure in the camp, ensuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over – the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza.”
The goal of the operation in Jenin is more ambitious than previous incursions. Hundreds of civilians have left the camp; Jenin governor Kamal Abu Al-Roub told CNN Thursday that it was now nearly empty. Water had been cut off and the area was “under siege,” he added.
The latest IDF operations have involved building more roadblocks across the West Bank. The Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission said Thursday there are now nearly 900 military checkpoints, including more than 173 iron gates installed since October 2023.
Al-Roub said the IDF operation was “one of the biggest and most intense” yet launched: “We are talking over 20,000 people have been displaced. Many have been arrested.”
Palestinian television reported Thursday that the IDF had established roadblocks near Ramallah and sealed off one village in the area. Additionally, it said military checkpoints in the Nablus area had been reinforced, leaving thousands of people stranded amid lengthy waits.
People were also unable to leave Jericho, where military checkpoints had been closed. Palestinian journalists reported Thursday that tear gas had been used against people waiting at a Jericho checkpoint.
One woman had died of a heart attack at a checkpoint near Hebron after the IDF prevented her from being transferred to hospital, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported Wednesday.
Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told CNN a trip from Ramallah to Jericho, which usually takes 45 minutes, can now take five hours some days.
“Most of the movement from the south and north of the West Bank is paralyzed while illegal Israeli settlers move freely and continue to attack Palestinian cars on the roads,” he said.
“We are seeing disturbing patterns of unlawful use of force in the West Bank that is unnecessary, indiscriminate and disproportionate. This echoes the tactics Israeli forces have employed in Gaza,” said Angelita Caredda, Middle East and North Africa regional director for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).
The IDF said Thursday that the checkpoints were “a tool we use in the fight against terror, enabling civilian movement while providing a layer of screening to prevent terrorists from escaping.”
How does the ceasefire affect the situation in the West Bank?
The operation began two days after the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire began and demonstrates a shift in the Israeli government’s focus.
Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Tuesday: “We have begun to change the security concept in Judea and Samaria [the Biblical term many Israelis use to describe the West Bank] and in the campaign to eradicate terrorism in the region.”
He also claimed the cabinet had decided that security in the West Bank had become an official war goal for Israel. The Prime Minister’s Office did not confirm the move.
The truce in Gaza has allowed Israeli security forces to concentrate on the West Bank, where groups aligned with Hamas have become more active. There is a risk, however, that intensive Israeli military action across the West Bank will put the Gaza ceasefire under strain.
Katz has frequently alleged that Iran is behind the surge in militant activity in the West Bank and is supplying weapons to the groups.
“We will not allow Judea and Samaria to become like Gaza or southern Lebanon… We will act to cut off Iran’s tentacles in the refugee camps in the West Bank and ensure the security of the communities and residents.”
Israeli officials have said that the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been unable to confront and subdue militant groups. An operation in December by the Palestinian security forces against militants in Jenin yielded little progress. The militant factions include the Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Qassem Brigades, who together fight under the banner of the Jenin Battalion.
Israel’s Channel 11 quoted a senior military source Thursday as saying, “The PA did what they could. We recognized the need to act against the terrorists’ capabilities, we are no longer waiting for their intentions. Our goal is to neutralize the Jenin battalion.”
How the Trump administration affects dynamics
To some right-wing Israelis, the advent of the Trump administration – along with success in degrading Hamas and Hezbollah – provides a unique opportunity to extend Israeli superiority in the region.
During his first term, Trump abandoned the long-held US stance that settlements are illegal; Biden restored it. Several of Trump’s nominees have suggested Israel has the right to annex the West Bank.
More than 500,000 Jewish settlers live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war. Jewish settlements there are considered illegal under international law.
Elise Stefanik, who is slated to become the new US ambassador to the United Nations, said Tuesday she agreed with the view that Israel has “a biblical right” to annex the West Bank. Mike Huckabee, who is expected to become US ambassador to Israe l, has said in the past that there is “no such thing as a Palestinian.”
On Monday, the day he took office, Trump rescinded sanctions imposed by the former Biden administration on far-right Israeli settler groups and individuals accused of being involved in violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
Anti-Palestinian violence by extremist settlers has become a near-daily occurrence in the West Bank. In 2024, the UN documented 1,420 incidents of settler violence resulting in casualties and/or property damage in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
Some of those responsible were arrested, but the Israeli Defense Ministry last week decided to release Jewish settlers held under what’s known as administrative detention “in light of the expected release of terrorists to the territories of Judea and Samaria,” under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal.
Katz said the decision to release the settlers would “send a clear message of strengthening and encouraging settlement, which stands at the forefront of the struggle against Palestinian terror and growing security challenges.”

Israel’s military is using lessons from its offensive in Gaza in its new West Bank operation to ensure “terrorism does not return,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday.
Katz said operation “Iron Wall” in the Jenin refugee camp would be a shift in the military’s security approach in the occupied West Bank.
“A powerful operation to eliminate terrorists and terror infrastructure in the camp, ensuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over – the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza,” he said.
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the start of a “large-scale military operation” in Jenin – just two days after the Gaza ceasefire came into effect.
Scenes have since emerged of broken concrete and rubble filling the streets. Palestinian authorities described besieged hospitals and entire neighborhoods cut off from residents. Meanwhile, relief workers raised fears that the devastation wrought by the Israeli campaign in Gaza will be replicated in the West Bank.
Israeli troops and settlers have killed at least 851 Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack, including 173 children. On Tuesday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said nine more people had been killed, ranging in age from 16 to 57 years old. In addition, a 29-year-old man was killed in the town of Ta’nek, in Jenin district, the ministry said. One medic told CNN a four-month-old baby arrived with shrapnel wounds at a Jenin hospital.
According to the UN, 2024 was the third-deadliest year for Israelis in the West Bank since data collection began in 2008. The agency recorded the deaths of 34 Israelis – 15 soldiers and 19 civilians. Of those civilians, seven were settlers.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said on Tuesday that Israeli warplanes had struck Jenin and that Israeli forces, including sharpshooters and armored vehicles, were surrounding the city’s refugee camp and stopping ambulances from entering.
Meanwhile Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), one of the militant groups active in Jenin, accused the Palestinian security forces of taking part in the operation by the Israeli military there. PIJ said the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority (PA) “only serves the (Israeli) occupation.”
Efforts by the Palestinian security forces over the last month to dislodge militant elements described as “outlaws” have largely failed.
More than 500,000 Jewish settlers live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war and is now home to 3.3 million Palestinians. Jewish settlements there are considered illegal under international law.
Katz said Israel would not allow Iran or any armed groups to threaten Israeli citizens. Israeli officials have previously accused Iran of assisting militant factions in the West Bank, especially in the Jenin refugee camp.
It comes as a senior Iranian official warned Wednesday that resistance to Israel will remain “as long as repression stays.”
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Javad Zarif, Iran’s Vice-President for Strategic Affairs, said, “I wouldn’t suggest anybody to start rejoicing over destroying Hamas, Hezbollah or the Palestinian resistance, or to cutting Iran’s arms, because the resistance will stay as long as the occupation stays – as long as repression stays.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Wednesday that along with the Israeli Security Agency, known as Shin Bet, and Israel Border Police, it had “hit more than 10 terrorists” in the Jenin operation and conducted “aerial strikes on terror infrastructure sites,” while “numerous explosives planted on the routes by the terrorists were dismantled.”
Hospital ‘under complete siege’
The scale and intensity of the Israeli operation in the West Bank city of Jenin is “by far the hardest and most troubling” in recent months, according to its mayor,
The Israeli military has sealed off five big residential neighborhoods, Mohammad Jarrar told CNN on Wednesday, adding that the “entire camp” has become “impossible to get into.”
Asked about the mayor’s comments, the Israel Defense Forces told CNN that there had been changes to “protocols to ensure safe movement and expand inspections” at checkpoints in the West Bank to prepare for the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal.
However, it added that it “a closure has not been imposed on cities/villages in Judea and Samaria, and entry and exit are permitted through the open checkpoints,” using the biblical term by which Israelis refer to the West Bank.
It came after video obtained by CNN showed Israeli military bulldozers digging up a road outside the Jenin government hospital on Tuesday evening, leaving piles of rubble in front of the driveway by morning. The hospital is close to the entrance to the refugee camp.
Dr. Wissam Bakr, director of Jenin Hospital, told CNN Wednesday that the facility was “under complete siege by Israeli military.”
“No-one can enter or exit the hospital since yesterday. Yesterday, five medical staff were injured from Israeli military gunfire,” Bakr said. “The roads outside the hospital have been destroyed by the Israeli military bulldozers. No ambulances are able to arrive to the hospital.”
Dr. Fawaz Hamad, the director of Al-Razi Hospital, also in Jenin, told CNN he has received more than a dozen injured patients since Tuesday – the youngest of whom was a four-month-old baby injured by gunfire shrapnel in the Jenin refugee camp.
In total, the renewed operation has rendered four hospitals in the area less accessible to residents – some of whom “fled fearing the worst” – Jarrar, the city’s mayor, told CNN.
“If the Israeli military goes with the planned attack of destroying the camp and those neighborhoods, it will be a man-made disaster similar to what we have seen in Gaza,” he added. “We are still appealing to the world to intervene… These are lives of people we are talking about; men, women and children.”
Nearly 900 military checkpoints and gates have been set up across the West Bank since October 7, 2023, according to a statement from the Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, a group affiliated with the Palestinian Authority, in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Wednesday.
The Palestinian foreign ministry accused Israel of “collective punishment” against residents of the West Bank on Tuesday by sealing off of all entrances to Palestinian governorates, cities, towns, and refugee camps.
It said it considered the operation in Jenin to be “part of an official Israeli plan aimed at consolidating the occupation, imposing Israeli law, and the gradual annexation of the occupied West Bank, including Jerusalem.”
Aseel Baidoun, a staffer for the NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), based in Ramallah, said: “Living in the West Bank today feels like being trapped in an open-air prison.”
Baidoun’s testimony was shared with CNN by MAP. “Now that there is a suspension in Israel’s war on Palestinians in Gaza, it feels like the Israeli military is starting a war on us in the West Bank,” she added.",['Lucas Lilieholm'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/middleeast/gaza-war-ceasefire-snapshot-dg-intl/index.html,Gaza after 15 months of war: A snapshot in maps and charts,2025-01-20 00:00:00,"A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect on Sunday, with the first six-weeks of the deal ushering in a pause to fighting, the staggered release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and an influx of aid to Gaza. The three-phase ceasefire has raised cautious hopes for an end to the war.
Israeli bombardment of Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has caused a devastating impact on the territory, with aid agencies warning that damage to critical infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, water and health care facilities, will take years to rebuild.
Here’s a look – in 6 charts – at what Gaza is like after 15 months of war.
An additional 11,000 people remain unaccounted for – likely either missing or not yet found under rubble, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
However recent research suggests that the death toll could be far higher than current estimates. A London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) study that was also published in The Lancet journal this month found that the Palestinian health ministry has underreported the death toll by approximately 41%. As of October 2024, the number of Gazans killed by violence was thought to exceed 70,000, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the health ministry said in October that one third of those killed in the first year of the war were children.
Israeli military strikes have razed most of Gaza to rubble, with Gaza City the most heavily destroyed. Around 436,000 housing units have been destroyed or damaged across the strip, according to the United Nations.
Around 1.9 million Palestinians – or about 90% of the population – are internally displaced, according to the UN. Many people in Gaza have been displaced multiple times – some up to 10 times.
The Israeli military regularly ordered evacuations from one area of danger to another, according to the UN, who have repeatedly said there “is no safe place in Gaza.” Evacuation orders were issued across 67% of Gaza throughout the course of the war, according to data from the Institute for the Study of War.
Those orders were often airdropped by the Israeli military – a method Amnesty International said was “not an effective warning to civilians” – or posted to social media – an inaccessible form of communication for many Gazans without power or internet.
The Israeli military has said that it does all it can to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza, including by sending text messages, making phone calls, and dropping evacuation leaflets to warn civilians ahead of attacks.
Al-Mawasi, a 67 square kilometer (25.9 square miles) area – roughly the size of Manhattan, has become the main displacement and refuge area for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians ordered by the Israeli military to leave their homes. Before the war, there were 9,000 people living there. By July 2024, the population of the camp had swelled to 1.7 million, according to the UN-backed Famine Early Warning Systems Network. In October, the camp’s population was estimated to be 730,000, according to UNICEF.
Despite being designated as a humanitarian zone by Israel, Al-Mawasi has been targeted repeatedly by Israeli airstrikes.
Many people in Gaza have struggled to access food for over a year.
Prior to the war, Gaza was “largely self-sufficient” in fresh produce, according to the UN. Israel’s military operation has damaged or destroyed up to 96% of agricultural assets, including farms and orchards, according to the World Bank. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN that it “does not intentionally harm agricultural land and seeks to mitigate environmental impact absent operational necessity.”
Most of Gaza is reliant on humanitarian aid, but many aid entry points into Gaza have been closed by Israeli authorities throughout the war.
That includes the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the sole border crossing between Gaza and Egypt – and once one of the largest and most important aid crossings into Gaza – which has been closed since May 2024, when Israel seized control of it. Other aid entry points have been open with extremely limited access.
The UN said in November that people are “effectively starving as the conflict rages, with humanitarian organizations blocked from delivering assistance to those in need.”
Before the war, an average of 500 trucks a day – around 15,000 trucks a month – containing aid and commercial goods entered Gaza per month.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update on Tuesday that only 2,205 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the month of December, excluding commercial vehicles and fuel.
Israel disputed that number, saying there is no limit on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza and that over 5,000 trucks had entered over the course of the month, according to a statement from the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which manages the flow of aid into the strip.
Meanwhile, trucks that do enter Gaza are now facing additional challenges in moving across the territory: Approximately 68% of the road network has been damaged, according to satellite imagery analysis by UNOSAT.
And criminal gangs continue to loot convoys carrying food.
Gaza’s health care system is in ruins. Prior to October 2023, there were 36 operational hospitals in Gaza. Now, not a single hospital in Gaza is fully functional.
Israel’s pattern of attacks has “pushed the health care system to the brink of total collapse,” according to a December UN report. To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 654 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza, resulting in 886 fatalities and 1,349 injuries.
The IDF has said that Hamas fighters embed inside hospitals and store arms in them.
Only half of Gaza’s hospitals are partially operational, relying solely on aid and fuel deliveries to function.","['Soph Warnes', 'Rachel Wilson', 'Lou Robinson', 'Renée Rigdon']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/middleeast/israel-west-bank-operation-intl/index.html,"As fighting in Gaza stops, Israel launches major military campaign in West Bank",2025-01-21 00:00:00,"The Israeli military killed at least 10 Palestinians, including a child, in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday as its prime minister announced the start of a “large-scale military operation” in the restive city of Jenin – just two days after the Gaza ceasefire came into effect.
Israel’s security cabinet launched the military offensive – which involved the Israeli military, police and Shin Bet security agency – to “eradicate terrorism in Jenin,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. The operation is called “Iron Wall,” he said.
In response, Hamas issued a statement calling for “people in the West Bank and its revolutionary youth to mobilize and escalate the clash with the occupation army at all points of contact with it.”
The Palestinian state news agency Wafa said Israeli warplanes struck Jenin and Israeli forces, including sharpshooters and armored vehicles, were surrounding the city’s refugee camp and stopping ambulances from entering.
Videos from local journalists showed a large number of armored vehicles, including bulldozers, entering Jenin. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 10 people – nine men and one teenage boy – were killed and 40 injured in the city.
It is not yet clear whether those killed were bystanders or engaged in hostilities with Israeli forces. Videos from the scene seem to show that at least two were civilians who appeared to be unarmed. Local residents told CNN that a man who was shot and later pronounced dead in a hospital in Jenin was a civilian.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s armed wing Al Quds Brigades said its fighters were firing at advancing Israeli troops around the refugee camp.
Islamic Jihad said Israeli military operation is an attempt by Netanyahu to save his “faltering government coalition” and spoil the “joy” after Palestinian prisoners were released in the West Bank as part of the Gaza truce.
“We call on our people throughout the occupied West Bank to confront this criminal campaign by all means, thwart its goals, and consolidate the enemy’s defeat in subduing the will of our people in the West Bank and Gaza,” the militant group said in a statement.
This latest offensive comes after the Israeli military carried out a major and deadly military operation in the northern West Bank in August and September. That campaign was called “Operation Summer Camps.”
New ‘war goal’
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right nationalist who opposed the Gaza ceasefire, said in a statement Tuesday that security in the West Bank had been added to the country’s “war goals.” CNN has asked the Prime Minister’s Office for confirmation of that claim.
“After Gaza and Lebanon, today, with God’s help, we have begun to change the security concept in Judea and Samaria and in the campaign to eradicate terrorism in the region,” he said, using the biblical name by which Israelis refer to the West Bank.
Smotrich had publicly toyed with quitting the Israeli government over the Gaza ceasefire, but decided to stay in the cabinet after saying he had received assurances from Netanyahu on his commitment to continue Israel’s military operations.
There has been a significant uptick in violence in the occupied West Bank since the ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas came into effect on Sunday.
On Monday, the outgoing Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said the military “must be ready for significant operations” in the occupied West Bank.
The United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) in Ramallah said Monday that it was “alarmed” by this new wave of violence by Israeli settlers and security forces in the West Bank.
Israeli security forces shot and killed a reportedly unarmed 14-year-old Palestinian boy on Sunday, the OHCHR said in a statement on Monday.
The OHCHR said “scores of settlers” stormed several Palestinian towns on Sunday, torching houses and vehicles, blocking roads and throwing stones.
The attacks continued on Monday, residents of Al-Funduq, a town east of Qalqilya, told CNN. They said a large group of armed settlers set fire to vehicles and shops in the town, throwing stones and firing towards houses before moving to a nearby village where they burnt two tractors and a plantation nursery, as well as caused damage to a house.
The international community has long condemned settler violence which has increased in recent years and gone mostly unpunished.
The US, under the Biden administration, had imposed sanctions against several Israeli settlers allegedly responsible for deadly violence but those sanctions have now been rescinded, with the decision to do so among the slew of executive orders US President Donald Trump signed upon taking office on Monday. The following day, Trump’s nominee to be US ambassador to the UN, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, said she agreed with the view espoused by a number of far-right politicians in Israel that Israel has “a biblical right” to annex the West Bank.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law and the United Nations’ top court said in July that Israel’s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem was illegal.
Regarding the latest bout of violence, the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem said that “settlers, backed, escorted, and with full cooperation (of) the Israeli army,” attacked Palestinian communities in the West Bank. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on settler attacks in several parts of the territory.
The IDF said it and the police responded to reports of riots in Al-Funduq on Monday and two settlers were shot by the police during that response, according to a statement from the police.
Israel’s emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) said it treated two casualties, one in “critical condition” and one in “serious condition.” Both patients had “penetrating injuries” and were evacuated to the Meir hospital, according to the MDA.
A joint statement from several Israeli commanders said on Tuesday that initial investigation indicated that “dozens of Israeli civilians, some of whom were masked, arrived at the area of Al-Funduq, instigated riots, set property on fire, and caused damage.”
The IDF’s response to the settler attack in Al-Funduq sparked more violence on Tuesday. The police said 17 people were arrested and three police officers injured during a protest over the shooting of the settlers.
Israeli troops and settlers have killed at least 851 Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack, including 173 children. Meanwhile, 2024 was the third-deadliest year for Israelis in the West Bank since data collection began in 2008, according to the UN, which recorded the deaths of 34 Israelis – 15 soldiers and 19 civilians.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/middleeast/israeli-military-chief-of-staff-resigns-intl/index.html,Israeli military chief of staff resigns over failure to prevent October 7 attack,2024-05-06 00:00:00,"Israel’s military chief of staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, has said he will resign in March over the failure to prevent the October 7 attack.
In a letter to Israel’s prime minister and defense minister released by the military, Halevi said: “As a result of my responsibility for the IDF’s failure on October 7, and at a time when the military has recorded exceptional achievements in restoring Israel’s deterrence and strength, I wish to conclude my tenure on March 6, 2025.”
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz had given Halevi a deadline of January 30 to complete internal military probes into the failure to prevent Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack.
Halevi’s resignation marks the highest-profile departure of an Israeli official linked to the security establishment’s failures on October 7. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declined to take responsibility for those failures, stating that accountability will come only after the war.
In a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said that Netanyahu spoke with Halevi on Tuesday and “thanked the Chief of Staff for his long service and his command of the IDF.”
The resignation comes just days after a ceasefire with Hamas went into effect in Gaza. Discussions for a permanent end to the war are, under the agreement, meant to begin February 4.
“On the morning of October 7, under my command, the IDF failed in its mission to protect the citizens of Israel,” Halevi wrote. “The State of Israel paid a heavy and painful price in lives lost, in those taken hostage, in the wounded – both physically and mentally.”
The military chief had also been under pressure from Israel’s far-right nationalist ministers, who viewed him as unable or unwilling to carry out their maximalist vision for war in Gaza and the West Bank.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich toyed with the idea of resigning from government over his opposition to the Gaza ceasefire, but decided to remain after saying he had received assurances from Netanyahu to continue Israel’s military operations.
The Commanding Officer of the Israel’s Southern Command, Major General Yaron Finkelman, also submitted his resignation, saying that he had “failed in protecting the western Negev and its beloved, heroic residents” on October 7.","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Mick Krever', 'Jeremy Diamond']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-aid-challenges-ahead-intl/index.html,Gaza ceasefire brings hope but aid workers warn of major hurdles ahead,2025-01-20 13:18:43,"As the Gaza ceasefire takes hold, aid workers caution that the toughest challenges are yet to come, describing the truce as only the first step on a long road to recovery.
For humanitarian workers and aid agencies, the road is expected to be long and arduous – with challenges including areas in the north of Gaza that remain hard to reach and criminal gangs that loot United Nations convoys carrying precious food, to a looming Israeli ban on the main UN agency responsible for distributing aid in Gaza.
At least 630 aid trucks entered Gaza on Sunday, with at least 300 of them headed to the north, according to a senior UN official. The UN, which said it has 4,000 trucks ready to enter Gaza, says the availability of food is not the problem, but that the delivery mechanism is wrought with obstacles.
“The issue is not to get the goods in,” Palestine Country Director for the UN World Food Programme (WFP) Antoine Renard told CNN from Gaza last week. He added that there are currently goods on standby at the Egyptian border with Gaza, and that the aid is gradually making its way from Ashdod in Israel, where it arrives for redistribution.
Enough food aid is waiting at Gaza’s borders to feed 1 million people for three months, WFP has said. It also has supplies such as food parcels, wheat flour, commodities for hot meals, and nutrition supplements.
But some areas in Gaza remain totally cut off from aid.
“Barely any food has gone into besieged North Gaza for more than two months. Winter cold and rain are further reducing people’s ability to survive,” WFP warned.
Israel launched a military offensive in northern Gaza in October for the third time since the war began, leading to a “full closure” to aid for the first 15 days of that month, Renard said. Israel had said it was battling resurging Hamas fighters.
Some Gaza governorates began slowly opening up after last October, including in Gaza City, Renard said, but parts of the north remained choked ahead of the ceasefire, which came into effect Sunday.
The northern governorates of Jabalya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun remain severely restricted. “We had to cut everything (there after the Israeli military operation),” he said.
WFP said that in the north, West Erez (Zikim) crossing is operational, but is only supplying aid to Gaza City. “Access to North Gaza governorate has been consistently denied,” it said.
Israeli ban on UN agency
Apart from cutting off parts of the north, an Israeli ban against WFP’s aid partner, UNRWA, is set to come into effect in two weeks. WFP and UNRWA each support 1.1 million people in Gaza, making UNRWA’s role crucial for aid distribution.
The ban came after Israel accused some UNRWA employees of participating in the attack that left 1,200 people in Israel dead. A UN investigation found that nine employees from UNWRA “may have” been involved in the October 7 attack and no longer work at the agency.
UNRWA has, however, long been a target of Israeli criticism. Israel has accused the UN agency of anti-Israel incitement, which UNRWA denies. In 2017, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to dismantle the UN body.
Last year, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, passed two bills; one barring UNRWA from activity within Israel, and another banning Israeli authorities from any contact with UNRWA – revoking the 1967 treaty that allows the agency to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control.
The move is expected to severely restrict UNRWA from operating in territories Israel occupies, including Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
“We do not know how Israel is going to implement the Knesset bills,” Renard said, adding that the UN agency will nonetheless remain operational.
It is unclear if the UN has a contingency plan for when the ban comes into effect.
“Our plan is to stay and deliver until we cannot,” UNRWA Communications Director Juliette Touma, told CNN Friday, adding that UNRWA can only hand over operations to a Palestinian institution, which can only happen through “a diplomatic solution that will also address the plight of Palestine refugees.”
The UNRWA official added that the agency has not received “any communications from the government of Israel on how they plan to implement those bills.”
In response, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said that there are “a lot of other agencies” that can help with humanitarian aid into Gaza.
“We have states that want to help to achieve that goal. So UNRWA is not an objective. UNRWA is also not the solution,” Sa’ar told reporters Sunday, adding that “the UN is in a position to help assure that the objective of the humanitarian aid to Gaza residents won’t be hurt.”
Criminal gangs in Gaza
Another challenge faced by aid groups is looting of relief supplies by criminal gangs operating in Gaza.
One of the ways aid trucks try to mitigate that risk is to use protected roads that aim to circumvent looting areas.
Israel has repeatedly accused the UN of allowing aid that’s been delivered into Gaza to pile up at the enclave’s borders without being distributed. But Renard said that convoys are often looted as soon as they enter Gaza.
Distributors “are too afraid of losing the cargo,” he said.
Palestinian NGOs inside Gaza have previously accused Israeli forces of targeting civil police and other aid safeguarding bodies “to incite chaos and lawlessness.”
CNN has reached out to the IDF about their stance regarding Gazan civil police.
“The law and order remain a sticky point, but with the ceasefire coming in, would the blue police be able to operate?” Renard questioned, referring to Gazan civil police.
The war in Gaza has killed more than 46,900 people during the 15 months it has dragged on, according to the health ministry there, as well as decimating large swathes of the territory and displacing nearly the entire population.
The number of people killed is believed to be significantly higher than the figure reported by authorities in the enclave, according to findings announced by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and published in The Lancet journal, which found that the ministry has underreported the death toll due to violence by approximately 41%.",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/14/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-deal-explainer-intl/index.html,A long-awaited ceasefire has finally begun in Gaza. Here’s what we know,2025-01-14 14:55:13,"Three hostages were released from Hamas captivity in Gaza and dozens of Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel on Sunday, as a highly anticipated ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect.
The agreement delivers the first reprieve for the people of Gaza in more than a year and only the second since the Israeli bombardment began. The military offensive launched by Israel in response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks has killed nearly 47,000 Palestinians and injured 110,750 more, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
The deal will see the release of dozens of Israeli hostages in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and will allow for a significant uptick in aid to enter the enclave, where residents have long faced dire humanitarian conditions.
Here’s what we know.
What happened on Sunday?
The ceasefire was due to begin at 8:30 a.m. local time in Gaza (1:30 a.m. ET) on Sunday, but was delayed for nearly three hours after Israel said Hamas had not delivered the names of the first three hostages to be released. Hamas blamed a “technical” hold up. The truce eventually began at 11:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. ET).
Israel’s military continued to pound northern and central Gaza during the delay. At least 19 Palestinians were killed and 36 others were wounded in strikes Sunday morning, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense. Israel’s military said it had struck “terror targets.”
Later Sunday, three female Israeli hostages were released from Hamas captivity. Romi Gonen, 24; Doron Steinbrecher, 31; and Emily Damari, a 28-year-old British-Israeli citizen, are now back in Israel.
The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Israeli government that all three are in good health, an Israeli official told CNN.
The freed hostages’ mothers traveled to Re’im, southern Israel to welcome their daughters home, Israel’s military said. The three women were transferred to the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, and will receive further treatment.
“Emily is finally home,” Damari’s mother said in a statement. A photo shows Damari smiling and holding up her bandaged hand to the camera.
Large crowds gathered at the Al-Saraya Junction in Gaza City to watch as the three women were handed by Hamas to the Red Cross. Dozens of masked militants from Hamas’ Al Qassam Brigades and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s Al-Quds Brigades were present.
Meanwhile, Israelis had gathered in the so-called Hostages Square in Tel Aviv – the site of countless demonstrations over the past 15 months that have called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do more to secure the hostages’ release.
“We can breathe a little more again,” after months of waiting, said Mai, who had joined the gathering. “And we are going to be here until the very last one comes back.”
In exchange, Israel freed 90 Palestinian prisoners on Sunday. Among them are 69 women and nine minors, the youngest of whom is 15.
Buses carrying the freed Palestinians out of Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank were met by huge crowds, cheering and waving flags, with video showing jubilant scenes and emotional reunions as they hugged their families. Earlier, Israeli drones dropped tear gas canisters to disperse crowds near the prison, injuring at least seven people, the Palestine Red Crescent said.
The respite from violence means that many Palestinians displaced in Gaza during Israel’s war are returning home. One Gazan told CNN the moment was “bittersweet.” Many houses have been reduced to rubble.
The Israeli military has withdrawn from several locations in southern and northern Gaza, an Israeli military official told CNN.
How will phase one of the deal work?
The first phase will last for six weeks and will see the staggered release of 33 Israeli hostages.
Hamas and its allies still hold 91 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023. At least 34 of them are dead, according to the Israeli government, but the true number is expected to be higher. Hamas holds an additional three hostages who have been captive since 2014.
Israel’s government press office on Sunday confirmed the names of the 33 captives due for release, 31 of whom were kidnapped on October 7. The two others have been held since 2014 and 2015. Among those due for release are the two youngest hostages held by Hamas – Kfir and Ariel Bibas who, if alive, would be 2 and 5 years old, respectively.
In return, Israel is expected to release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The Israeli government has approved the release of 737 Palestinian prisoners and detainees as well as 1,167 Gaza residents it is holding who were not involved in the October 7 attacks.
The Gaza-based Prisoners Media Office, however, said that Israel will release 1,737 prisoners, including 120 women and children. Nearly 300 Palestinians serving life sentences will also be among those released, according to their office.
It is unclear why the two sides issued different figures. CNN has asked both to clarify.
During the first 42-day phase, Israel is due to withdraw from population centers but will retain a presence along Gaza’s borders and on a road dividing the territory.
What does it mean for aid?
The agreement allows for a dramatic uptick in humanitarian relief to enter Gaza.
The number of aid trucks entering the enclave will increase to 600 per day, a significant improvement from the 614 truckloads of aid that entered Gaza in the first two weeks of January, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
After waiting for days at the border, trucks surged into the enclave on Sunday. UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher said at least 630 trucks with humanitarian aid entered Gaza on Sunday, with at least 300 of them going to the north. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said that it had 4,000 aid trucks ready to go.
The World Food Programme (WFP) confirmed Sunday that its first aid trucks had started to cross into Gaza. It said that the trucks entered via the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings.
The UN has warned the increased aid allotment would be “only a start” in addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the enclave. The World Health Organization said Gaza’s “health challenges ahead are immense,” as residents of the war-torn enclave face rising disease and malnutrition.
Israeli strikes have laid waste to large swathes of Gaza and human rights groups have described “unspeakable” living conditions.
Israel’s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. In December, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel of “acts of genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza by deliberately depriving them of adequate water supplies.
How does the rest of the deal work?
Negotiations to reach the second and third phases of a ceasefire agreement – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal, according to an Israeli official.
Israel has not committed to ending the war, but has said it will take part in negotiations to progress the ceasefire to its next phases. Mediators in Cairo, including Egypt, Qatar and the United States, will monitor the implementation of the deal.
Although the ceasefire is not guaranteed to last beyond the first phase, the Israeli official told CNN that Israel is eager to “bring all our hostages back home.”
The deal has caused a political storm in Israel. On Sunday, three far-right Israeli ministers from the Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party resigned from Netanyahu’s government in opposition to the ceasefire – National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu, and Minister of the Negev, Galilee and National Resilience Yitzhak Wasserlauf.
Another far-right minister of Netanyahu’s coalition, Bezalel Smotrich, opposes the deal but has not resigned. Smotrich, who serves as minister of finance, threatened to resign if Israel does not return to war after the first phase of the truce ends.
What happens next in the war?
With the second and third phases uncertain, there are no guarantees that Israel will not resume its bombardment of Gaza.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told CNN that Israel hadn’t achieved its goal of defeating Hamas, saying the group was “still in power in Gaza.”
He stressed that the agreed ceasefire is temporary and “it is not automatic to move from one phase to the other phase.”
In a speech on Saturday, Netanyahu said both outgoing US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have agreed to support Israel’s decision to return to war if Hamas does not abide by the deal.

“How good is it that you’ve come home,” read a sign in Hebrew held by the young daughter.
The helicopters, which took off from southern Israel, near the Gaza border, carried Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari – the first of 33 hostages set for release during the first phase of the deal that went into effect Sunday morning.
The three women were kidnapped by Hamas during its attack on October 7, 2023, which killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 250 others captive.
Footage shared by the Israeli government shows the three women arriving at the hospital, draped in Israeli flags and embracing their families.
In exchange, Israel is expected to release 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including 69 women and nine minors, the youngest of them 15 years old.
Near the Sheba hospital, a group of Israelis played music and sang patriotic songs on Sunday night. As medical vehicles carried the hostages from helicopters to the medical facility, dozens chased the vans, chanting their names.
“Thank you, thank you,” one woman cried as she was embraced by another.
Earlier in the so-called Hostages Square in central Tel Aviv, a wave of applause overtook the plaza once the hostages were announced to be in the custody of the Red Cross.
People hugged, waved flags and cried at the news. For many Israelis, it was a moment they had dreamt of throughout the 15 months of war in Gaza.
“Romi is coming back! Emily is coming back! Doron is coming back!” a group chanted in the square.
Confirmation of the handover for the crowd came on a large television screen in the square, which was broadcasting Al Jazeera with Israeli commentary playing in the background.
‘Everybody is crying’
Among those waiting for the hostages’ release was 29-year-old Shay Dickman, who stood at the center of the square carrying banners of all three women. She is a cousin of Carmel Gat, who was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and killed in captivity. Another cousin of hers was released in the short-lived ceasefire-and-hostages deal of November 2023.
The three hostages “are about to come back in our safe hands,” Dickman told CNN in Hostages Square, just minutes before their release was announced.
Tania Coen-Uzzielli, director of Tel Aviv Museum of Art, had been watching the square – where Israelis gather daily to express solidarity with the hostages – from her nearby museum every day.
She said that previously, she had sometimes felt that the return of the hostages was “wishful thinking.” Their release brings “unbelievable” emotions, she said.
“It’s a very emotional moment,” Coen-Uzzielli told CNN. “We were waiting for this moment since the last release, which was more than one year ago.”
Coen-Uzzielli said she could feel “the pulse” of the plaza every day, as it is right next to her museum.
“Everybody is crying,” she said.
Mai, another woman, who declined to give a second name, said, “We can breathe a little more again” after months of waiting. “And we are going to be here until the very last one comes back.”
The first phase of the agreement is expected to last six weeks, during which time 30 other hostages are to be gradually released.
The war has been devastating to Palestinians living in the besieged enclave. The military offensive launched by Israel in response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks has killed nearly 47,000 Palestinians and injured 110,750 more, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
The war has also displaced nearly all of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million people, flattened swathes of the territory in an Israeli bombing campaign and triggered a spiraling humanitarian crisis.
Israel has not committed to ending the war, but has said it will take part in negotiations to progress the ceasefire to its next phases. Mediators in Cairo, including Egypt, Qatar and the United States, will monitor the implementation of the deal.
In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Bianna Golodryga, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on Sunday stressed that the ceasefire agreed to is a temporary one, saying “we will start to negotiate on the second phase after a little bit more than two weeks during the first phase,” but added that “it is not automatic to move from one phase to the other phase.”
Coen-Uzzielli, the art museum director, said she hopes that the remaining hostages are freed and that the war finally comes to an end.
“I really hope that an international force will influence the ultimate decision to continue the release of the hostages and to stop this tragic war,” she said.","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Mike Schwartz']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/19/middleeast/analysis-hamas-hostage-release-israel-intl-latam/index.html,"As first Israeli hostages are released, Hamas sends a message: It is far from being destroyed",2025-01-19 00:00:00,"Israel’s longest war has so far failed to destroy its main enemy, Hamas, which, despite suffering devastating losses, is framing the Gaza ceasefire agreement as a victory for itself – and a failure for Israel.
Soon after a ceasefire came into effect on Sunday, masked gunmen emerged in vehicles roaming the devastated streets of Gaza in celebration. Members of an elite unit wore their full uniform at Al Saraya Square in Gaza City during the hostage transfer. It was Hamas’ reminder that its armed wing was still here 15 months after Israel set out to destroy them.
One of Hamas’ main goals for taking some 250 hostages during its brazen October 7, 2023, attack on Israel was to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. As Israel pounded Gaza in response Hamas vowed not to return the hostages until Israel withdrew its forces from the enclave, permanently ended the war, and allowed for rebuilding.
After more than a year of fighting, Hamas and Israel in recent days reached a phased agreement that will see the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in addition to a 42-day ceasefire and the entry of aid. The deal also opens the door for further negotiations that could lead to a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire.
“(The agreement) achieves all these conditions… the resistance has achieved what the Palestinian people want,” Hamas senior political member Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera after a deal was reached.
Khalil Al Hayya, Hamas’ main negotiator, said in a speech on Wednesday that Israel had failed to achieve its war goals and praised Hamas’ armed wing, Al Qassam Brigades, whose spokesman Abu Obaida commended the war in Gaza as an “inspiration” for generations to come. Israel’s main goal of the conflict was to eliminate Hamas.
Some Israeli ministers, lawmakers and even a small minority of hostage families view the acceptance of a deal as an Israeli defeat. Far-right minister Itamar Ben Gvir and his party resigned from the government and Knesset (parliament), calling the truce a “surrender.” Fellow right-winger, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called it “catastrophic” and a group of army reservists labeled it “The Surrender Deal.”
“When you see … the dancing in Gaza, the celebrations in villages in Judea and Samaria – you understand which side surrendered in this deal,” Ben Gvir said in a statement on Thursday. Judea and Samaria is what Israel calls the West Bank.
But most in Israel are welcoming the agreement, including the majority of the hostage families, Israel’s President Isaac Herzog and the political opposition. Netanyahu’s office said after the security cabinet approved the deal that the prime minister still “supports the achievement of the objectives of the war.”
A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Netanyahu told ministers that the US has provided guarantees “that if Hamas sabotages a certain stage of the deal, Israel can resume fighting.”
‘Hamas survival is a defeat for Israel’
Israel’s response to Hamas for the October 7 attack was intense. It flattened Gaza under the most severe bombardment campaign in the enclave’s history, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians and displacing hundreds of thousands more, many of whom were forced to live in tents with little food and inadequate medical care.
Israel also inflicted heavy losses on Hamas, killing its top leadership, including the mastermind of the October 7 attack Yahya Sinwar, and claimed to have killed thousands of the group’s fighters. It was relentless in rooting out reemerging militants in previously cleared neighborhoods, all while fighting, and eventually defeating, Lebanon’s Hezbollah in the north, which had opened a new front against Israel in support of Gaza.
The Hamas that was once in military and political control of Gaza has been reduced to a fraction of its old self after Israel’s 15-month campaign, and with the significant weakening of its regional allies Hezbollah and Iran, the group has become regionally isolated.
Yet the movement has continued to present itself to Palestinians as the most formidable armed resistance group against Israel, replenishing its ranks by recruiting almost as many new militants as it has lost.
“Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas militants regroup and re-emerge because there’s nothing else to fill the void,” United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in remarks at the Atlantic Council recently.
“Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost. That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.”
Tahani Mustafa, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group (ICG), argues that the suffering inflicted on Gaza’s Palestinians by Israel’s war creates fertile ground for recruitment.
“You can see a recruitment surge precisely because when there’s occupation and violence you can find relevance there,” she told CNN. “How can you expect whole hosts of segments of Gaza’s population who have lost everything to simply take it lying down? It’s a war for survival. Groups like Hamas provide (the Palestinians) with the means of doing that.”
In his comments to the Atlantic Council, Blinken said the US has stressed to the Israeli government “that Hamas cannot be defeated by a military campaign alone, that without a clear alternative, a post-conflict plan and a credible political rise to the Palestinians, Hamas or something just as abhorrent and dangerous will grow back.”
Hamas pledges to rebuild
The governance of post-war Gaza remains unaddressed, possibly due to skepticism over whether the ceasefire agreement will progress beyond the initial phase. Israel’s ultimate war goal is the complete destruction of Hamas. But Hamas appears unconcerned, suggesting that its cadres will play a role in rebuilding the devastated enclave. “The whole population, and the resistance as part of it, will begin rebuilding what the occupation has destroyed,” Hamas’ Hamdan told Al Jazeera.
Hamdan maintained that regardless of the outcome, the day after for Gaza will remain similar to the day before.
“The day after, is like today, is like the day before…it will be a Palestinian day,” Hamdan said.
While Hamas may be claiming victory, it has failed to force Israel to lift the crippling siege on Gaza and has presided over Israeli strikes that killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians and made Gaza unlivable. The October 7 attack, and the war it triggered, have had a ripple effect, significantly altering the regional balance of power and fundamentally reshaping the region.
Hamas doesn’t see its survival as a goal in this war, but for Israel, the group’s very survival can be considered a “defeat,” the ICG’s Mustafa said.",['Mostafa Salem'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/18/middleeast/israel-approves-ceasefire-hostage-deal-intl-hnk/index.html,"Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal to begin Sunday, bringing rare halt to months of fighting",2025-01-18 06:50:12,"The long-awaited ceasefire and hostage release deal between the Israeli government and Hamas will take effect on Sunday, potentially signaling a new chapter in a bloody 15-month conflict that has enflamed the Middle East.
The deal, which is made up of three phases, will come into effect at 8:30 a.m. local time (1:30 a.m. ET) on Sunday.
The first phase, expected to last six weeks, will see a pause to the fighting in Gaza and the release of 33 Israeli hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
Humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip will also be ramped up; 600 trucks will now be sent into the enclave per day, a significant increase from the 614 truckloads of aid that entered Gaza in the first two weeks of January, according to data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
The deal was reached between Hamas and Israel on Wednesday, but still needed final approval from the Israeli government before it could be enacted.
The 33-member cabinet deliberated for more than seven hours into early Saturday before green-lighting the agreement, according to a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. There were 24 votes in favor of the deal and eight against, an Israeli official told CNN, with communications minister Shlomo Karhi abstaining.
It will be the second ceasefire since the war started on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched an attack on Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The military offensive launched by Israel in response has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its figures.
Though Israel’s Supreme Court will still hear appeals by Israelis opposing freedom for any Palestinian prisoners slated for release, that process is not expected to delay the start of the ceasefire.
Hostages released
The breakthrough has inspired fresh – yet cautious – hope among the families of Israeli hostages still trapped in Gaza, many of whom do not know if their relatives are dead or alive.
“Nobody knows the fate of their loved one for sure,” Sharone Lifschitz, whose father has been held hostage in Gaza since October 7, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “If he has stayed alive, it’s a wonderful miracle.”
Foreign hostages, including Americans, are expected to be released in addition to the 33 Israeli hostages, a source familiar told CNN Friday.
Three female Israeli civilian hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released on the first day, according to two US officials. Ninety-five Palestinian prisoners are set to be released after 4 p.m. local time Sunday, Israel’s Ministry of Justice said.
Hamas and its allies still hold 94 people taken from Israel 15 months ago. At least 34 of them are dead, according to the Israeli government, though the true number is expected to be higher.
All but 10 of the 94 hostages are Israeli or dual citizens, while eight are from Thailand, one is from Nepal, and one is from Tanzania, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office.
Negotiations for the second and third phases of the ceasefire will begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal, according to an Israeli official.
A joint operations room will be established in Cairo to monitor the implementation of the deal and will include representatives from Egypt, Qatar, the United States, Israel, and Palestinian officials, according to Egypt’s state-affiliated Al Qahera News, citing a senior Egyptian official.
Humanitarian relief
The deal also offers an opportunity for humanitarian workers to shuttle much-needed aid into the battered Gaza enclave, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are starving, according to the United Nations, and living conditions are dire.
Hundreds of aid trucks carrying food, clothing, medical supplies and other relief materials, are lined up at the Rafah border crossing in anticipation of the deal going into effect Sunday, Al Qahera News reported. The trucks came from various areas of the Egyptian region of North Sinai, and some have been waiting for months, the news outlet said.
However, the United Nations warned Thursday the increased aid allotment would be “only a start” in addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the enclave.
The start of the ceasefire will be a reprieve for Gazans who have endured 15 months of relentless Israeli strikes, which have reduced much of the enclave to rubble.
Scenes of jubilation emerged across Gaza shortly after mediator Qatar announced Wednesday that Israel and Hamas had come to the agreement, though Israel’s bombardment has ramped up in the days since.
Israeli strikes have killed more than 122 people since the ceasefire deal was announced, including 33 children, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense.
The first ceasefire, in November 2023, lasted about a week. In that period, 105 hostages being held by Hamas – primarily women, children and elderly people – were released, while Israel released about 240 Palestinian prisoners from its jails.
Netanyahu faced major political fallout ahead of the cabinet meeting to approve the deal, with two far-right parties threatening to quit the government if the deal went through – a move that could cause the prime minister to lose his majority in the Knesset, or parliament.","['Mick Krever', 'Kareem El Damanhoury', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq', 'Lex Harvey']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/middleeast/israel-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-deal-netanyahu/index.html,Israel’s approval of the Gaza deal unmasks deep schisms that could threaten the ceasefire and Netanyahu’s political future,2025-01-18 00:03:12,"Don’t let Israel’s approval of the Gaza ceasefire fool you: There are deep schisms in Israeli politics that could threaten the longevity of the deal.
The ceasefire as agreed to in Qatar is set to last 42 days. Over that period, 33 hostages are expected to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, there will be a slow withdrawal of the Israeli military from urban centers in Gaza and a surge of humanitarian aid.
Israel’s government approved the deal with Hamas after deliberations among the 33-member cabinet lasted for seven hours and unusually ran into early Saturday morning on Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest.
But it is very much not a permanent end to the war, nor does it guarantee freedom for the 65 hostages who would remain in Gaza at the end of this first phase – many of whom are likely dead. That is yet to be negotiated, starting by day 16 of the truce.
Whether any of it comes to pass may be dictated by the vagaries of Israeli politics. The deal to which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed is remarkably similar to a proposal he railed against for almost a year.
“We haven’t committed to any of the delusional demands of Hamas,” the Israeli prime minister said in February last year. “I told (US Secretary of State) Antony Blinken we are nearly there with complete victory.”
The proposal he was criticizing would have seen a multi-stage ceasefire, the phased withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. That happens to be the exact thing to which Netanyahu has now agreed.
Though Hamas is undeniably weakened, Israel has not achieved the “complete victory” that Netanyahu long promised. “We assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it is lost,” Blinken said this week.
Netanyahu’s extremist allies in government are confused by his sudden about-face.
“I love Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and will make sure that he continues to be prime minister,” Itamar Ben Gvir, the national security minister, said in a statement Friday morning. “But I will leave (government) because the deal that was signed is disastrous.”
Ben Gvir has said that his Jewish Power party will withdraw from the governing coalition if the ceasefire and hostage deal goes through. His departure would not by itself be enough to topple the government. And he could well return – it will be hard to step away from power for a man who not long ago was on the very fringes of politics, having been convicted of inciting terrorism and considered so extreme that the Israeli military rejected him from service.
But what could topple the government is if Ben Gvir is joined by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich in withdrawing from Netanyahu’s coalition. Smotrich, also an extreme right-wing nationalist, wants to make sure that the peace in Gaza is not permanent, and that Israel goes back to war after the 42-day ceasefire that is expected to see 33 hostages released.
While Smotrich’s departure would break Netanyahu’s coalition, his government could be saved by his rival, Yair Lapid of the opposition Yesh Atid party, who has offered a political lifeline to the prime minister by supporting him in the legislature. That means that Lapid would hold a sword over Netanyahu’s neck, could collapse the government and bring about an election whenever he chooses – a threat the prime minister will surely do anything to avoid.
It is unclear whether Netanyahu has given Smotrich any promises to secure his support – solving today’s crisis is more important than solving tomorrow’s. He is clearly keen for it, having met with Smotrich twice in the hours leading up to the ceasefire announcement in Qatar. President Biden said Wednesday “the plan says if negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire will continue, as long as the negotiations continue.” But were Israel to begin bombing on day 43, the agreement would collapse.
In the hours after the Qatari prime minister announced the agreement on Wednesday, Netanyahu’s office sent a cascade of press releases accusing Hamas of reneging on promises to give Israel a veto over some Palestinian prisoners due to be released.
The statements made clear that he was being tough by telling his team to stand firm. Those 11th-hour hitches may have been real – though Hamas denies it. But the very public chest-beating crediting the prime minister’s “firm stance” was surely intended to placate the domestic, far-right audience. Once the differences were bridged, the cabinet appeared to fast-track its approval – moving a planned Saturday meeting to the final hours of Friday.
Another factor may also be at the center of Netanyahu’s capitulation to this initial ceasefire: incoming American president Donald Trump.
His self-styled image as the American president who ends foreign wars will surely bring an enormous amount of pressure on Netanyahu to stay with the agreement, for which Trump has taken credit and dubbed “EPIC.”
Netanyahu was able to ignore President Joe Biden’s overtures, confident that he had an even more steadfast ally, Trump, waiting in the wings.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/15/us/whats-in-the-hamas-israel-ceasefire-and-hostage-release-deal/index.html,What’s in the Hamas-Israel ceasefire and hostage release deal,2025-01-15 00:00:00,"The first phase of the deal reached between Hamas and Israel on Wednesday includes a pause in the war and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli custody.
But several details and the timeline of the full deal remain unclear and will be key to its success moving forward.
The deal represents the second ceasefire since the war started on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants launched an attack into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The military offensive launched by Israel in response has killed at least 46,645 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
The first ceasefire, in November 2023, lasted about a week. In that period, 105 hostages being held by Hamas – primarily women, children and elderly people – were released, while Israel released about 240 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
The current ceasefire deal is set up to progress in three distinct phases.
Phase one is expected to start at some point Sunday and last for six weeks. This phase will feature a ceasefire, a withdrawal of Israeli troops, a swap of hostages and prisoners, and an influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza. US hostages held in Gaza will be released in that first phase, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday.
The second and third phases are less developed, and the details will be decided during the first phase, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a briefing Wednesday.
“We will continue to do everything we can, everything possible together with our partners, to ensure that this deal is implemented as it’s agreed,” he said, noting that mediators had spent 411 days working on the agreement terms. “And this deal will bring us peace, hopefully, at the end of it. I believe that it all depends on the parties of the agreement acting in good faith in that agreement in order to ensure that no collapse happens to that deal.”
Hamas hailed the deal on Wednesday as a “crucial turning point.” Israel’s cabinet must still vote to approve the deal before it goes into effect.
Here’s a closer look at what’s in the current ceasefire deal and the steps ahead.
Ceasefire, Israeli withdrawal and aid
The ceasefire deal would deliver the first reprieve from war for the people of Gaza in more than a year, and only the second since the Israeli bombardment began.
The Israeli military would begin withdrawing from population centers during the first phase, but would remain along the Gaza-Egypt border, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, an Israeli official said Wednesday. Israel would also maintain a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border with Israel, the size of which has been one of the final sticking points in the negotiations.
The deal is expected to allow Palestinian civilians to return to their homes across Gaza, including in the devastated north. There would be a massive influx of humanitarian aid into the strip, where residents have long faced dire humanitarian conditions, Al Thani said.
Gaza’s wounded will also be allowed to leave the enclave to receive treatment, while aid will be allowed into the strip with hospitals and bakeries undergoing repairs, he said.
Which hostages and prisoners will be released?
As part of that first phase, Hamas and its allied militant groups will release 33 hostages in the first phase, including female soldiers, children, the elderly and the sick, Al Thani said.
Under the deal, American hostages being held by Hamas “will be part of that hostage release on phase one,” Biden said.
Three female Israeli civilian hostages are expected to be released on the first day of the ceasefire and then on the seventh day, Hamas is set to release four more, according to a document shared by senior Hamas official Bassem Naim.
Following that, “Hamas will release three Israeli detainees every seven days, starting with women (civilians and soldiers),” the document states.
“During the sixth week, Hamas will release all remaining detainees included in this stage, and in return, Israel will release the agreed upon number of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons, based on lists provided by Hamas,” the document continues.
According to the document, Israel will release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners who were arrested on October 8, 2023, but were not involved in Hamas’ attack on Israel the day before. Of the 33 hostages Hamas is expected to release, nine who are ill and injured will be exchanged for 110 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences, according to the document.
Hamas and its allies hold 94 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023. Of those, at least 34 are dead, according to the Israeli government, though the true number is expected to be higher. Eighty-one of the hostages are men and 13 are women. Eighty-four are from Israel, while eight are from Thailand, one is from Nepal, and one is from Tanzania.
Hamas holds an additional four hostages held captive since 2014, at least two of whom are dead.
Israel holds at least 10,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Commission of Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society – though that number does not include an unknown number of Palestinians taken captive in Gaza. The figure of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel includes 3,376 people held under administrative detention, meaning they have neither had public charges against them nor faced trial, including 95 children and 22 women.
Second and third phases to be negotiated
The second and third phases of the ceasefire still have to be negotiated during the first. Those negotiations will begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal, according to an Israeli official.
The ceasefire is not guaranteed to continue beyond the first phase of the deal. However, the official said Israel is eager to “bring all our hostages back home,” and will enter negotiations for the second phase in good faith, which could lead to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
Biden said the second and third phases will include a release of further hostages and the beginning of Gaza’s rebuild.
“When phase two begins, there will be an exchange for release of the remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza, and the temporary ceasefire will become permanent,” he said.
“And finally, under phase three, any final remains of hostages who have been killed will be returned to their families, and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin.”
How the deal will be enforced
In response to a question from CNN’s Becky Anderson, Al Thani said the US, Egypt and Qatar have put a mechanism in place to ensure neither side breaks the ceasefire.
“It will be placed in Cairo, and this follow-up actually will be a joint team from the three countries that will monitor the implementation of the agreement,” he said. “Everything has been agreed upon and will be in place, hopefully, on the day of the execution.”
Al Thani said this ceasefire deal was different from the one in November 2023 that lasted just a week.
“Unfortunately, the agreement in November was very transactional. So it was like a day-by-day,” he said. “But this agreement has a clear mechanism for the first 42 days, and there is a clear mechanism to negotiate phase two and three, and all the details of the agreements will be published in the next couple of days once the details are finalized.”","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Mick Krever', 'Lauren Kent', 'Eric Levenson']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/15/politics/biden-trump-gaza-ceasefire-deal/index.html,How the Biden and Trump teams worked together to get the Gaza ceasefire and hostages deal done,2025-01-15 22:49:48,"When Qatar’s prime minister emerged Wednesday to declare — at long last — that a ceasefire-for-hostage deal had been struck in Gaza, representatives for two American administrations were on hand in Doha to bask in the victory.
The cooperation between the two was “almost unprecedented,” a senior Biden administration official said after the deal was clinched, made possible by a rare intersection of interests between bitter rivals who both saw an opening following Trump’s victory.
Brett McGurk, the longtime Middle East negotiator for President Joe Biden, had been planted in the Qatari capital for weeks in the hopes of a final agreement. He was joined in recent days by President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for the final push.
At points, McGurk and Witkoff divvied up meetings across the Middle East to push the deal across the line, including critical talks between Witkoff and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that McGurk joined by phone. If McGurk was focused primarily on the parameters of the deal, Witkoff was on hand to emphasize Trump’s desire to see a deal finished by Inauguration Day.
After the agreement was announced, both the incoming and outgoing president took full credit, a sign the poisonous relationship between them endures.
Ultimately, however, the deal enables both Biden and Trump to claim victory. It notches a final bit of positive news for a president who is poised to leave office with the lowest approval rating of his term. And it bolsters the bonafides of a president-elect who vowed “all hell would break out” in Gaza if the hostages were not released before his second inauguration.
The reality of who is responsible for the deal is complex. Biden administration officials say momentum toward a deal began before the election, after a separate ceasefire was struck between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The contours of the final agreement with Hamas map closely with a proposal Biden first unveiled in May, but was unable to complete.
Speaking at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month, Witkoff said Biden’s team was the “tip of the spear” in the talks.
“No one has pride of authorship. We are totally outcome oriented. Let’s get them home,” Witkoff, a former real estate investor, said then.
Still, after the deal was struck, even Biden officials acknowledged the deadline of Trump’s entry into office was a motivating factor in finally finding success after months of failure. And Trump, who was monitoring developments from Florida, was quick to declare the agreement was only made possible by his win.
“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,” he wrote on social media.
Biden was more circumspect.
“It’s a very good afternoon,” Biden said Wednesday from the White House Cross Hall, steps from where members of the incoming Trump team were meeting with their Biden administration counterparts in the West Wing to discuss national security matters.
The president, who has decades of high-level foreign policy experience, described the talks that led to the ceasefire deal as “one of the toughest negotiations I’ve ever experienced.” He said his team had been “speaking as one” with Trump officials.
But asked as he was stepping away from the podium who deserves credit for Wednesday’s deal – himself or Trump – the president flashed his annoyance:
“Is that a joke?” he said before walking away.
Months of talks starting, stopping
By the final stretch of the 2024 presidential campaign, few inside the White House believed a hostage deal could be achieved before the results of the election were known.
American and European officials saw Netanyahu as biding his time, waiting to see which US president he’d be dealing with going forward – and keeping his options open for any outcome.
Hours of angry phone calls between the White House and Netanyahu’s office had yielded little progress, and even the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar did not immediately shake loose a deal.
Trump’s victory – widely seen inside the White House as Netanyahu’s preferred result – was hardly the outcome any Biden’s aides were hoping for. In their loss, though, some saw a fresh opportunity.
So during a post-election meeting with Trump in front of a roaring Oval Office fire, Biden had a request for the man who’d be replacing him in a few months: Work with the administration’s team to get the hostages out of Gaza.
In conversations between the incoming and outgoing national security teams, Biden’s aides made clear that whatever acrimony existed between the two men – and despite their friendly chat in the Oval Office, they remained bitterly opposed – the issue of the hostages was a place they must work together.
”We’re prepared to work with the incoming team in common cause on a bipartisan basis to do everything in our collective American power to secure the release of the hostages, both living and deceased,” Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the week after the November election.
A mutually beneficial agreement
In their fireside conversation, Biden and Trump came to an agreement that the hostage matter could and should be resolved before the hand-off of power on January 20, according to people who heard about the meeting afterward.
The timing suited both men.
Trump’s advisers have long felt that any agreement struck after his victory, but prior to him taking office, would enable him to take credit for it. It would also take the issue off his plate as he begins a second presidency squarely focused on fulfilling his campaign pledges on immigration, tariffs and dismantling Biden-era regulations.
For Biden, having finally secured the hostage deal he’s spent more than a quarter of his presidency trying to cement would validate time and energy – and political capital – lost to the cause.
And so, with both men’s blessing, the two opposing sides set to work on a final, last-week push to achieve what had for so long seemed impossible.
Late nights and final demands
A critical sticking point that had emerged over the past several months was Hamas’ refusal to acknowledge how many hostages it was still holding, or to identify which hostages it would release as part of the first phase of the deal, according to the senior administration official.
American officials made clear to Hamas through its intermediaries that no agreement could be realized without a full list of hostages that would be released as part of the deal.
The pressure appeared to work. By late December, Hamas had agreed to provide the list, accelerating talks to reach the final-stage negotiations toward a deal.
McGurk remained in the Middle East working toward completing the complex agreement, including finalizing details on the sequencing of how and when prisoners would be released.
Holed up inside a building in Doha, negotiators from the US, Israel, Qatar and Egypt, along with Hamas officials, talked until 3 a.m. as the sides attempted to finalize what had been a frustratingly elusive deal to end the conflict.
Hamas raised a number of last minute demands during the final negotiations. But the American and Israeli sides held firm as they pushed Hamas to agree.
Implementation of the deal could begin as early as Sunday, an official said.
As the reality of the deal sank in, Netanyahu got on the phone with his American counterparts. His first call was to Trump, to thank him and arrange a meeting in Washington. Next, he called Biden and “thanked him as well,” according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.","['Kevin Liptak', 'Michael Williams', 'Nikki Carvajal', 'Alayna Treene', 'Arlette Saenz']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/15/middleeast/israel-hostage-families-minority-oppose-deal-intl/index.html,A small minority of Israeli hostage families don’t want a Gaza deal. Here’s why,2025-01-15 16:36:21,"As Israel and Hamas edge closer to a possible ceasefire-hostage agreement, a small number of families whose loved ones remain captive in Gaza are saying “No” to a deal.
Many members of the Tikva (Hope) Forum fringe group, including settlers in the occupied West Bank, hold right-wing ideologies. They oppose the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel as part of the deal, arguing that a partial release of Israeli hostages from Gaza is unacceptable. Instead, they insist that defeating Hamas through strong military action should be the top priority, and is the best strategy to retrieve hostages.
The Tikva Forum, which says it was founded to bring the hostages home “from a place of strength, faith, national responsibility and concern for the unity and security of all Israelis,” is distinct from the Hostage Families Forum – which represents the majority of the hostage families, and has been leading protests advocating for a ceasefire and hostage deal.
Tzvika Mor, Tikva Forum’s co-founder, believes his son Eitan, who is being held in Gaza, would want him to oppose the deal.
“This deal that Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu is talking about today is very dangerous for my son and for most of the hostages, especially the young men and the soldiers that will stay in Gaza for decades,” Mor told CNN on Wednesday.
“I know definitely that Eitan wants me to make sure that the State of Israel will be safe,” he said, adding that if his son was not in captivity, he would have been “a soldier in Gaza or Lebanon or Syria.”
The Israeli government expects that an agreement on a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza will be announced later Wednesday or Thursday, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
The first phase of the deal is expected to see the release of children, women, the sick and the elderly who are held in Gaza for the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians from Israeli jails, some of whom were accused of killing Israelis.
Boaz Miran, who is also part of the Tikva Forum, also opposes the deal. His brother Omri was kidnapped by Hamas-led militants on October 7, 2023 from Kibbutz Nahal Oz in southern Israel, leaving behind his wife, Lishay, their two young daughters. The first phase of the deal is unlikely to see his brother released, given that it prioritizes women, children and the elderly.
Boaz has campaigned against the deal along with other families attached to the Tikva Forum. Members of the group often share views similar to those of Israel’s far-right politicians, who also oppose the deal, such as National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who threatened to withdraw from Netanyahu’s coalition if a deal is signed, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said a deal would be a “catastrophe.”
Both ministers are settlers with hardline views about Palestinians.
‘Monsters as our neighbors’
Mor, the co-founder for the forum, resides in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, near Hebron in the occupied West Bank. His son was kidnapped by Palestinian militants from the Nova Festival on October 7. He said that at least 15 families are part of the forum, but that many prefer to stay out of the limelight.
Miran and other members of the Tikva forum reject the Gaza deal in its current form, saying that hostages should come back in one wave, and that Palestinian “terrorists” should not be freed. “We believe all the captives should be returned in one deal, from a position of strength,” Miran said.
“I’m against this current deal because, first of all, it won’t bring back all the captives. It’ll be a partial release, the rest will probably be neglected,” Miran told CNN on Wednesday.
He also believes that the release of Palestinian prisoners would be catastrophic for Israel.
“We can’t have these monsters as our neighbors on the other side of the border. Sinwar was released as part of the (Gilad) Shalit deal (when the Israeli soldier was traded for over 1,000 prisoners in 2011), and look at what he did to us,” he told CNN, referring to Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7 attack, who was killed by Israel last year. “We can’t agree to a situation where the released prisoners will murder our people in the future.”
Israel holds at least 10,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Commission of Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society, including 3,376 people who have been held under administrative detention – a controversial procedure that allows Israeli authorities to hold people indefinitely on security grounds without trial or charge, sometimes based on evidence that isn’t made public. Ninety-five children are currently under administrative detention, according to the Commission of Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society.
The proposed deal is set to be implemented in three phases, the first of which would last 42 days. In the first phase, 33 hostages held by Hamas and its allies since October 7 will be released, including women, children, men over the age of 50 and wounded people. Israel would release “many hundreds” of Palestinian prisoners in exchange, an Israeli official said, including Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis.
Negotiations to reach the second and third phases of a ceasefire agreement – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal, according to the Israeli official.
Miran said that while he celebrates the release of each hostage, the deal as it stands would mean that the joy of some families would mean sadness for others, adding that “this deal will determine the fate of my brother Omri to rot in the tunnels of Hamas for months or even years to come.”
The Israeli government believes 98 hostages are still being held in Gaza – most of whom were abducted on October 7, 2023, dozens of whom are believed to be dead.","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Mike Schwartz']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/antony-blinken-post-war-gaza-plans/index.html,Blinken offers most detailed picture to date of post-war Gaza plans,2025-01-14 17:27:07,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered his most detailed picture yet of his long-awaited plans for post-war Gaza on Tuesday as he stressed the importance of not leaving a power vacuum in the decimated enclave.
Blinken presented the “core elements” in a speech at the Atlantic Council just days before his term as top US diplomat comes to an end. Although he said the plans would be handed over to the incoming Trump team, there is no evidence that the new administration intends to follow through with them.
The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has raged on for more than a year, with more than 46,000 people killed in the besieged enclave, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The majority of those killed have been women and children as efforts to achieve a ceasefire and hostage deal have only in recent weeks gained traction. Blinken on Tuesday expressed optimism about such an agreement, saying that it is “ready to be concluded and implemented” if Hamas accepts.
In what could be his final public remarks as secretary of state, Blinken sought to defend the Biden administration’s policy on Gaza – a policy that has faced sharp criticism from some Democratic lawmakers and current and former US officials, as well as human rights organizations that say Israel is carrying out genocide. The Biden administration and the Israeli government have rejected that conclusion.
In a speech interrupted multiple times by protestors calling him “bloody Blinken,” the top US diplomat acknowledged the deep divisions over the administration’s policy on Gaza, noting, “I wish I could stand here today and tell you with certainty that we got every decision right. I cannot.”
‘Hard decisions’ to come
“I wish I could tell you that leaders in the region always put their people’s interests ahead of their own interests. They did not,” Blinken said as he stressed the need for the day-after plans to be executed.
He said those plans would require “all parties to summon the political will to make hard decisions, to make hard compromises,” he said, including reform from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and acceptance by the Israeli government of eventual PA rule over a unified Palestinian state.
The State Department has worked for months with partners to draw up a day-after plan for security, governance and reconstruction in Gaza, arguing that the international community could not afford to wait until a ceasefire to have such plans.
In the more immediate post-war period, “we believe that the Palestinian Authority should invite international partners to help establish and run an interim administration with responsibility for key civil sectors in Gaza, like banking, water, energy, health, civil coordination with Israel,” Blinken described. “The international community would provide funding, technical support and oversight.”
Blinken said that interim administration would include Palestinians from Gaza and members of the PA. They “would hand over complete responsibility to a fully reformed PA administration as soon as it’s feasible,” he said.
The administrators would work closely with a senior UN official “who should oversee the international stabilization and recovery effort,” Blinken said.
“An interim security mission would be made up of members of partner nation security forces and vetted Palestinian personnel. Its responsibilities would include creating a secure environment for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts and ensuring border security, which is crucial to preventing smuggling that could allow Hamas to rebuild its military capacity,” he described.
“We would stand up a new initiative to train, to equip, to vet a PA-led security force for Gaza to focus on law and order and gradually take over for the interim security mission,” Blinken said, noting that “these arrangements would be enshrined in a UN Security Council Resolution.”
Path to a Palestinian state
Without naming specific countries, Blinken said that “some of our partners have already expressed their willingness to contribute troops and police for such a mission, but if and only if it is agreed that Gaza and the West Bank are reunified under a reformed PA as part of a pathway to an independent Palestinian state.”
Blinken said that path must be “time-bound” and “conditions-based,” saying those “principles are mutually reinforcing.”
“Time-bound, because no one will believe or accept an endless process,” he said. “Conditions-based because while Palestinians have a right to self-determination, with that right comes responsibility. No one should expect Israel to accept a Palestinian state that’s led by Hamas or other extremists.”
The top US diplomat raised the prospect of the elusive Israel-Saudi normalization deal as “the best opportunity to achieve the long sought goal of Israel’s greater integration in the region, and it’s also the best incentive to get the parties to make tough decisions necessary to fully realize the aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians.”
Blinken nodded to the extremism of far-right Israeli officials like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, saying that “Israelis must abandon the myth that they can carry out de-facto annexation without cost and consequence to Israel’s democracy, to its standing, to its security.”
“We sincerely hope the parties will be prepared to make tough choices going forward, and yet, the unimpeachable reality is that up to this point, they’ve either failed to make these difficult decisions or acted in ways that put a deal and long-term peace further from reach,” he continued.
“Israel’s government has systematically undermined the capacity and legitimacy of the only viable alternative to Hamas: the Palestinian Authority,” Blinken said. “Israel continues to hold back PA tax revenues that it collects on behalf of the Palestinians, funds that belong to the Palestinians and to the PA needs to pay people who provide essential services like health care and security in the West Bank, which is vital to Israel’s own security.”
“Israel is expanding official settlements and nationalizing land at a faster clip than any time in the last decade, while turning a blind eye to unprecedented growth of illegal outposts. Violent attacks by extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians have reached record levels,” Blinken continued.
Blinken said the US has stressed to the Israeli government “that Hamas cannot be defeated by a military campaign alone, that without a clear alternative, a post-conflict plan and a credible political rise to the Palestinians, Hamas or something just as abhorrent and dangerous will grow back.”
“That’s exactly what’s happened in northern Gaza since October 7. Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas militants regroup and re-emerge because there’s nothing else to fill the void,” he said. “Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it is lost. That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.”",['Jennifer Hansler'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/13/middleeast/hamas-33-hostages-israel-ceasefire-talks-intl-latam/index.html,Israeli officials say Hamas expected to release 33 hostages in emerging Gaza ceasefire deal,2025-01-13 19:19:49,"Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of an emerging ceasefire agreement being finalized by negotiators in Doha, two Israeli officials said, the first positive sign in months that a truce in the Israel-Hamas war may be in sight.
Officials have expressed cautious optimism that a deal could soon be announced to halt 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East and devastated Gaza, allow for more aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave, and ensure the return of dozens of hostages held by Hamas since its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
Hamas and its allies still hold 94 of the 251 hostages taken from Israel, including at least 34 of whom are dead, according to the Israeli government.
Israel believes that most of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the deal are alive, a senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday, but the bodies of dead captives will also likely be among those released. The first phase would take place over an initial 42-day ceasefire.
The senior Israeli official said the parties appear to be on the verge of an agreement and that Israel is prepared to immediately implement the deal once it has been inked.
US President Joe Biden expressed similar optimism in a speech Monday focused on foreign policy, saying the United States was “pressing hard to close this.”
“The deal we have structured would free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel, and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians who suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started. They have been through hell,” Biden said.
Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump told Newsmax that his understanding is that “there’s been a handshake and they’re getting it finished.” Trump’s incoming special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff previously told reporters he was working alongside Biden administration officials during the negotiations, and hoped to get a temporary ceasefire deal enacted before Trump’s inauguration on Monday.
A diplomat close to the negotiations told CNN a final round of proximity talks to finalize any issues was scheduled to take place in Doha on Tuesday. The same day, some of the hostages’ families have been invited to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
On Tuesday, protesters formed a human chain outside the Israeli parliament, also known as the Knesset, to demand the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza. Many held large banners with the names and faces of the captives alongside the words “DON’T leave me behind!”
One demonstrator, Shay Dickmann, said a family member held in Gaza had been released in a previous ceasefire and hostage deal in November 2023, while another — her cousin — had been killed while in Hamas captivity in the enclave.
“From my family, I know how it is when someone comes back alive on a deal,” she said.
“We are not going to let go for any one of them. We want them all back home. And it sounds like there is a chance right now, but we can’t let it go until we see them stepping here in Israel.”
Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees, told CNN on Monday that he was traveling to Doha to advise negotiators on the list of detainees to be released “in the event the deal materializes.”
The release of the 33 hostages would be the first phase of the deal being finalized. Negotiations to reach the second phase – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal.
Under the latest proposals, Israeli forces would maintain a presence along the Philadelphi Corridor – a narrow strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border – during the first phase of the agreement, the officials said. The presence of Israeli troops along the corridor previously contributed to sinking a potential deal in September during the last round of negotiations.
Israel would also maintain a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border with Israel, the official said, without specifying how wide that zone would be – another subject of contention during the negotiations. A Hamas official told CNN earlier that the group wanted the buffer zone to return to the pre-October 7 size of 300-500 meters (330-545 yards) from the border line, while Israel was requesting 2,000 meters.
The residents of northern Gaza would be allowed to return freely to the north of the strip, but an Israeli official claimed there would be unspecified “security arrangements” in place.
Palestinian prisoners deemed responsible for killing Israelis would not be released into the West Bank, the official said, but rather to the Gaza Strip or abroad following agreements with foreign countries.
CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment.
A senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday that a “breakthrough” in the talks came late Sunday night during Israeli intelligence agency Mossad Director David Barnea’s meeting with the mediators in Doha, Qatar.
“There is talk of an agreement in the near future – it is impossible to say whether it is a matter of hours or days,” the official said.
The official said Israel is prepared to quickly implement the agreement, but the deal must first pass both the security cabinet and full government cabinet. The government must also allow time for opponents of the agreement to petition the Supreme Court.
“We are closer than ever to a deal but mediators in Doha are still awaiting official responses from both sides,” said an Arab official briefed on the talks.
Speaking to CNN Monday, the former Israeli intelligence official Avi Melamed cautioned that even if a deal were reached, the continued presence of the Israeli military and Hamas in Gaza during the first phase of its implementation could risk reigniting hostilities.
“That part is very sensitive because it could potentially have the seeds that result in – at some point for whatever the reason – reignition or flares of fighting in Gaza. It’s not to say necessarily that that will happen, but it’s something that could happen and we should take it into consideration,” he said.
Melamed said that during the first phase of a deal, neither side would want to give up leverage but in the next phase would try to exhaust “any kind of leverage cards they have” including in the context of military capacities in Gaza.
Meanwhile, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Monday it remained hopeful but cautious amid the reports of a deal being close.
“We continue to trust in those working tirelessly to bring our loved ones home, and we will not rest until the last hostage returns,” the group said.
Israel launched its war on Hamas in Gaza following the attacks of October 7, 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Since then, the Israeli military has killed at least 46,565 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. More than 100,000 have been injured.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/13/middleeast/israel-hamas-deal-talks-intl/index.html,"US officials say Gaza ceasefire deal is in sight, the first sign of serious optimism in months",2024-12-15 00:00:00,"American officials believe a ceasefire and hostages release deal in the Israel-Hamas war is now in sight, in what marks the first real sign of serious optimism inside the Biden administration in months, sources familiar with the issue told CNN.
While they continued to emphasize that officials will remain cautious until the negotiations produce a final deal to end the Gaza conflict, as of Monday, the sources said US officials believe a ceasefire agreement could very well be announced in the forthcoming last days of President Joe Biden’s time in office.
Other sources told CNN that Israel, Hamas and the mediators were working through the final elements of an emerging deal.
“Now the final draft is being discussed by both parties, and each party is informing the mediators of its position,” a Hamas official told CNN.
Another source said that “all the big blocks (to a deal) have been resolved.”
US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told CNN earlier on Monday that “there has been significant progress made.”
“I am not going to sit here and make predictions – this has been a long time coming,” Finer said. “Fundamentally, we believe there is progress being made. There is a deal on the table that Hamas should accept.”
It comes as a Hamas official said Monday morning that the group is “very close to an agreement” with Israel.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also announced some progress, saying Monday that Israel is working hard to reach a deal in the ongoing negotiations being hosted in the Qatari capital of Doha, and that “progress was made.”
“Israel wants a hostage deal. Israel is working with our American friends in order to achieve a hostage deal, and soon we will know whether the other side wants the same thing,” Saar said in a news conference in Jerusalem.
Several sticking points remain, however, the Hamas official told CNN.
They include Hamas’ demands that Israel withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border, and commit to a permanent ceasefire rather than a temporary halt to the military operations launched in the wake of the Hamas October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel.
Disagreement also remains over an Israeli-proposed buffer zone inside Gaza to run along the strip’s eastern and northern borders with Israel. The official said that Hamas wants the buffer zone to return to the pre-October 7 size of 300-500 meters (330-545 yards) from the border line, while Israel is requesting a much larger 2,000-meter depth.
“We believe this means that 60 km (37 miles) of the Gaza Strip will remain under their control, and displaced people will not return to their homes,” the official said.
Beyond those key demands, the Hamas official said that negotiators were hammering out specific details of the release of Palestinian prisoners and maps covering the areas from which Israeli forces would withdraw.
The Hamas official told CNN earlier that Israel’s response to Hamas’ sticking points for a deal has been “mostly positive.”
Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees, told CNN separately on Monday that he is traveling to Doha to advise negotiators on the list of detainees to be released “in the event the deal materializes.”
The optimistic tone was tempered though by Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said Monday that the potential ceasefire-hostage deal would be a “catastrophe” for Israel’s national security. In a post on X, Smotrich described it as a “surrender deal” that would include releasing “terrorists” and “dissolving” the war’s achievements.
On Monday, 10 members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party sent a letter to the Israeli prime minister expressing concern about a potential agreement and reiterating three “red lines” should not be crossed. The Knesset members argued that Israel should not have to rely on others for security, all hostages must be returned and a mass return to northern Gaza should be prevented in any framework for a deal.
Netanyahu spoke with US President Joe Biden on Sunday, their first publicly announced call since October, about the progress in negotiations.
Netanyahu, who met with President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Saturday, is facing pressure from both the current and incoming US administrations to reach a deal.
Witkoff and Biden’s Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk, who are both currently in the region, have been working together in recent days with mediators to try to resolve some of the last remaining sticking points to get to the ceasefire deal, sources told CNN. The two US envoys have also had joint phone calls with Netanyahu.
Meanwhile, Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan has been in close consultation with top Israeli officials, including David Barnea, and Qatar’s prime minister, on Monday, per sources.
A source with knowledge of the ceasefire-hostage talks told CNN Monday that Trump is the incentive for Israel to strike a deal with Hamas. The source said Netanyahu “wants to remain close to Trump.”
“There’s a bigger picture here that he (Netanyahu) wants to achieve. And you know, remaining on track with Trump is important. That’s the thing,” the source added. They said that even if there is no deal by January 20, when Trump will be sworn in as president, then “we have to get to a framework” by that date.
On Monday US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan struck an optimistic tone, saying the two sides were inching closer to a potential deal and that it could “get done this week.”
“I’m not making a promise or a prediction, but it is there for the taking, and we are going to work to make it happen,” he told reporters at the White House Monday.
Finer said Monday that some remaining differences that were present in recent weeks “have been resolved or narrowed.”
Gazans hope for a ceasefire
Since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, the death toll from Israeli military action in Gaza has risen to 46,584, with 109,731 people injured, according to the latest daily report from the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
The report added that a number of victims are still under the rubble and on roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them.
Meanwhile, a peer-reviewed study by researchers from a leading health research university in the UK found the number of people killed in Gaza is significantly higher than the figure reported by authorities in the enclave.
On Monday, Israeli strikes on northern Gaza killed more than 40 people and injured dozens, a Gaza civil defense spokesperson said. “The bombing and killing have not stopped since dawn today,” Mahmoud Basal told CNN.
Gazans who spoke to CNN on Monday said they hoped negotiations could end the war, but they fear announcements of progress towards a deal are all “empty” promises.
“Every time they say there are negotiations, we hear nothing but their failure,” said Khan Younis resident Abdul Rahman Salama, who spoke to CNN as he was trying to recover items from the rubble of his destroyed house. “The destruction is unreal. I hope the war stops as suddenly as it started; it will end suddenly, but the negotiations are all empty talk — lies upon lies.”
Ahmad Salama, another man displaced from Khan Younis, said: “My family hopes that the negotiations will succeed so the war will end, and we can return to safety, and the fear and terror will stop, and we won’t have to flee from one place to another with the children and my mother again.”
The war in Gaza has also exacted a heavy toll on Israeli forces. At least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Gaza in the past week, according to the Israeli military.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/11/middleeast/lebanon-aoun-president-saudi-push-intl/index.html,Watershed moment for the Middle East after Lebanon elects new president - with a Saudi push,2025-01-10 00:00:00,"It was a last-minute push by Saudi Arabia that decided Lebanon’s fate on Thursday.
There were less than 24 hours before parliament was set to choose the next president. But Lebanon’s checkered political landscape was in total disarray.
The sectarian political elite seemed to be stuck at the drawing board. Presidents in Lebanon are brought to power by near political consensus, but more than six contenders were still in play. Debates were heated and army chief Joseph Aoun was dismissed by many politicians as constitutionally unqualified for the presidency because of his military post.
It looked like parliament was heading for its 13th failed attempt to elect a president in more than two years.
Then, a Saudi delegation headed by the kingdom’s envoy, Prince Yazid bin Farhan, flew into Beirut for the second time in a week. It held a blitz of meetings with various political parties. By the time they left, there was only one candidate left: the US-backed Aoun.
Ninety-nine lawmakers voted for Aoun, surpassing the requisite two-thirds of Parliament. The remaining 29 ballots were largely either blank or disqualified (one of the lawmakers cast his vote for “Bernie Sanders”).
Within minutes, Aoun arrived in parliament, having swapped his army fatigues for a suit and tie. He took an oath and gave an Earth-shattering, seemingly well-rehearsed speech, vowing to usher in Lebanon’s “new era” and monopolize weapons under the aegis of the state. In other words, Hezbollah, one of the world’s best armed militant groups for the better part of the last 40 years, was set to be disarmed.
Jubilation filled the streets. A presidential vacuum had been filled. A years-long stalemate between the confessional elite had broken - for the time-being at least.
But it was a development that raised larger questions. Why had Saudi Arabia expended so much diplomatic capital to deliver a president, ending nearly eight years of disengagement from Lebanon that it dismissed as “lost” to Iranian domination via Hezbollah?
Another factor that unlocked the Aoun presidency is also significant: Hezbollah and its allies in the Amal party voted for him.
It was a highly choreographed affair. Hezbollah and Amal, known as the Shia duo, cast blank votes in the first round of voting, which failed to produce a president. During a two-hour recess, the heads of their respective parliamentary blocs held a meeting with Aoun, the details of which are unknown. After returning to parliament, they cast their ballots for Aoun, breaking the deadlock and opening the path to the presidency.
The message was clear. Hezbollah may have been severely weakened by its war with Israel in the fall, and by the recent toppling of its key ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but it could still prolong a stalemate, or end it.
Why, however, had they voted for a president with a mandate to disarm them?
Saudi Arabia re-enters the fray
It is unclear what happened during the meetings where Saudi Arabia corralled overwhelming support for Aoun. But it was a full-throated effort that happened in tandem with Western diplomatic talks. France’s special envoy to Lebanon Jean-Yves Le Drian had also met with Hezbollah lawmakers.
France is one of the few Western countries that does not have a wholesale terror designation on Hezbollah, maintaining a diplomatic channel with the militant group’s political arm. It’s one of the only remaining links between the West and the Iran-backed group.
Earlier this week, US Special Envoy to Lebanon Amos Hochstein was also doing his part to prop up Aoun’s chances with a flurry of meetings.
None of this was lost on Lebanon’s lawmakers. “We’re not here to elect a president,” independent MP Jamil el-Sayyed told local TV station Al-Jadeed from parliament on Tuesday. “We’re here to certify the appointment of a president.”
In comments before the casting of ballots, anti-establishment lawmaker Halime El Kaakour gestured to the upper gallery where foreign dignitaries – including the American, French, Egyptian and Iranian ambassadors – sat. “No one should impose their will on us, not the tutelage of the Iranians, nor the Syrians, nor the Americans. We shouldn’t replace one (external) guardianship with another,” she said.
“No one should interfere with our internal affairs, with all my respect to the ambassadors here,” she continued. “We support international cooperation… but no one should interfere with our sovereignty.”
Aoun’s predecessor is the Hezbollah-backed former President Michel Aoun (the two are not related). His tenure, which ended more than two years ago, was widely seen as an era of Iranian domination in Lebanon, which saw an unprecedented surge in Hezbollah’s political power. That shift in external backing between the two President Aouns is a seismic change for the country.
Yet Hezbollah appears to be meeting this moment with a quiet and mysterious resignation. In his remarks to reporters after Aoun’s election, Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc leader Mohammad Raad said they voted for him to promote “national understanding.”
They withheld their vote in the first round, he added ambiguously, because they “wanted to send a message… that we are protectors of sovereignty.”
Strategic ambiguity may be the best card it holds at this pivotal moment. The militant group received a rapid succession of body blows during the two-month war with Israel in the fall, including with the killing of its long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. The ousting of Assad, who had opened his territory to the group’s supply lines with Iran, severely limited its ability to rearm.
The group has also agreed to withdraw its fighters from southern Lebanon, its powerbase for four decades and its primary battlefield with Israel, which occupied the area from 1978 to 2000, and which continues to be considered an enemy state by Lebanon.
Yet the disarmament is far from complete. Hezbollah is still believed to possess medium- and long-range missiles, and it continues to command a broad Shia support base. This means that there’s likely to be longer negotiations over their arms, undoubtedly roping in external forces.
This will also be a test of the nearly two-year -long rapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran. Domestically, Lebanon’s newly minted president must oversee this process while preventing the outbreak of civil strife, something he hinted at in his acceptance speech when he promised to stop the country’s factions from trying “to break each other’s heads.”
Meanwhile, Israeli forces still operate in some parts of south Lebanon. The government in Israel has threatened to keep the military there beyond the deadline at the end of this month as stipulated by the US-brokered ceasefire agreement that ended the war in late November.
Aoun has promised to force their withdrawal, a responsibility he said would fall to the state alone.
These are uncharted waters for the tiny and troubled eastern Mediterranean country. But for many here, there’s reason for optimism.
“Lebanon finally has a president who brings to the Lebanese people and international community both humane leadership and statehood legitimacy,” said Lynn Zovighian, a columnist, philanthropist and founder at social investment platform Zovighian Partnership.
“It is time for leadership, constitutional order, a strengthened state, and humanization so that we can finally achieve socio-economic prosperity, justice, and accountability,” Zovighian told CNN.",['Tamara Qiblawi'],en

Hamza Al-Ziyadnah, 23, was found dead in a tunnel in the Rafah area, a joint statement from the Israel Defense Forces and Internal Security Agency, known as Shin Bet, said on Friday.
The Israeli military said Wednesday it had recovered the body of Yousef Al-Ziyadnah, 53, from a tunnel in the Rafah area and had discovered evidence that raised “grave concerns” for his son’s life.
Hamza and his father were kidnapped during the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and had been held in the Gaza Strip.
“Hamza and Yosef were abducted alive on October 7 and were killed while in Hamas captivity,” the statement said.
The Al-Ziyadnah family are part of the Bedouin Muslim-Arab community that lives in southern Israel’s Negev desert.
Yousef and three of his children – Hamza, Bilal, and Aysha – were taken from Kibbutz Holit in southwest Israel, where they used to work. Bilal and Aysha were among the dozens of hostages returned in the short-lived ceasefire deal in November 2023.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed grief at the news of Hamza’s death and again called for a deal to release the remaining hostages held in Gaza.
“Yosef and Hamza, who survived a period in the hell of Gaza captivity, could have been saved through an earlier agreement,” the statement said.
“The time and conditions are ripe for all the hostages to return – bringing the living home for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial,” it said. “The negotiations must be expedited to secure an immediate deal for their return. This historic window of opportunity stands before us and must not be lost.”
No breakthrough in hostage talks
Talks over a potential hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza appear deadlocked, with Hamas claiming that Israel has introduced new conditions and Egyptian mediators sounding downbeat about progress.
A Hamas official told CNN on Friday that Israel has demanded holding on to a 1-kilometer strip of territory along the eastern and northern borders of the enclave.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was responding to a report by Reuters citing an unnamed Palestinian official about the alleged new condition.
“Israel still insists on keeping a 1 km landscape along the eastern and northern borders of the Gaza Strip, which will restrict the return of residents to their homes and represent a retreat from what it (Israel) had agreed upon in July,” the official told Reuters.
The Hamas official who spoke to CNN said Israel’s conditions included “much more” but did not offer further details.
CNN has reached out to Israel about the claims.
Meanwhile, an Egyptian official and another diplomat briefed on the matter told CNN on Friday that the indirect talks between Hamas and Israel in Qatar have yet to reach a breakthrough, despite statements from United States officials indicating that they were progressing.
“There is a clear appetite on the part of the Americans to get a deal done for the incoming Trump administration,” the diplomat said. But the diplomat sounded a note of caution: “Things are going well but there is still a lot of work to do.”
The comments come a day after US President Joe Biden said he met with negotiators and added that his assessment was that there was “real progress” being made.
We’re making some real progress. I met with negotiators today,” Biden said. “Hope springs eternal, but I think I’m still hopeful that we’ll be able to have a prisoner exchange. Hamas is the one getting in the way of that exchange, right now.”
US President-elect Donald Trump warned in a press conference this week that if the hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza are not released by his inauguration on January 20, “all hell will break out in the Middle East.”
Ninety-eight hostages are still being held in Gaza, including 36 who are presumed to be dead, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office.
Steve Witkoff, Trump’s pick for special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters Wednesday he will be travelling to Qatar for the talks, saying negotiators are “making a lot of progress,.” and appeared to suggest that a deal before January 20 was realistic.
However, a senior Biden administration official struck a more cautious tone, telling CNN that the negotiations remain “difficult.”
US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators are in the Qatari capital Doha in their latest push to close a deal between Hamas and Israel after more than a year of failed negotiations.","['Eugenia Yosef and Lucas Lilieholm', 'Eugenia Yosef', 'Lucas Lilieholm']",en

The ICC’s targeting of Netanyahu has sparked backlash from Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The GOP-led Senate is expected to next take up the bill.
There remains widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for US military assistance to Israel, but scrutiny over US support for Israel’s war against Hamas has intensified as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has grown worse. The issue has opened up a rift within the Democratic Party as progressives have been highly critical of the Israeli government.
The ICC issued arrest warrants last year for Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and a senior Hamas official, accusing them of war crimes during and after the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel.
The prime minister’s office has dismissed the warrants as “absurd and antisemitic.”
The legislation calls for the warrants against the Israeli officials to be “condemned in the strongest possible terms.” And, according to the legislative text, the measure would impose sanctions with respect to the court over “any effort to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute any protected person of the United States and its allies.” The sanctions include prohibiting US property transactions and blocking and revoking visas.
Headquartered at The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC was established in 2002 and is tasked with prosecuting individuals for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
The ICC does not have its own enforcement mechanism and has relied on countries’ support for arrests. Israel, like the United States, is not a member of the ICC and has challenged the court’s jurisdiction over its actions in the conflict.
The House passed the ICC sanctions bill in the last session of Congress by a vote of 247 to 155, with 42 Democrats joining Republicans in support, but it was not brought to a vote in the Senate, which was then under Democratic control. Congressional Republicans are bringing it back up now that they control both the House and the Senate.

Army chief Joseph Aoun was voted president after two rounds of voting. This came after a robust efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United States to rally support for Aoun, who is close to Washington and Riyadh.
After he was declared president, Aoun effectively stepped down as army chief. He arrived in parliament to be sworn in dressed in civilian clothing.
In his acceptance speech, Aoun hailed the dawn of a “new era” in Lebanon, vowing to disentangle the country from its myriad economic and political crises. He also made a rare promise to “monopolize weapons” under the mandate of the state, a clear allusion to the arsenal of the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.
Hezbollah is the best armed militant group in the Middle East, and until a devastating war with Israel last fall, wielded influence across at least three countries.
The heavy blows dealt by Israel during the conflict, coupled with the downfall of its ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, severely weakened Hezbollah, reviving a long-standing domestic debate about the group’s disarmament.
The US-brokered ceasefire agreement signed on November 27 also stipulates that Hezbollah must withdraw from the border region with Israel, further undermining its military position. Israeli forces are also required to leave Lebanese territory by the end of January under the terms of the agreement.
The Lebanese army did not participate in the all-out war with Israel but is a key player in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.
“The Lebanese state – I repeat the Lebanese state – will get rid of the Israeli occupation,” Aoun said his speech. The new president also raised the specter of a Lebanese “defensive strategy” against Israel – officially classified as an enemy state – without Hezbollah. The armed group was long considered the de facto military force tasked with fighting Israel.
“My era will include the discussion of our defensive strategy to enable the Lebanese state to get rid of the Israeli occupation and to retaliate against its aggression,” said Aoun.
Lebanon had been without a president since the end of the tenure of former President Michel Aoun – who is not related to Joseph Aoun – in October 2022. The former president was backed by Iran-supported Hezbollah. Negotiations over his successor were unsuccessful, reinvigorating tensions between the country’s pro-Western and pro-Iranian camps.
Prior to Thursday’s parliamentary sessions, there were 12 failed attempts to elect a president over the last two years.
Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc said they had cast their ballots for Aoun during the second round of voting to promote “national cohesion,” but withheld their votes during the first round to “send a message.”
“We wanted to send a message… that we are protectors of sovereignty,” head of the Hezbollah bloc Mohammad Raad told reporters. Aoun won by 99 parliamentary votes out of 128 in the second round of votes.

The guidelines, announced Wednesday, require the names and faces of most of its soldiers – both active duty and reserve – to be obscured.
The decision comes after a former Israeli soldier fled Brazil last week after a court in the South American country ordered an investigation into allegations by a pro-Palestinian NGO that the soldier was involved in war crimes in Gaza.
The soldier arrived back in Israel on Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate Kan. The Israeli outlet published an audio interview with him in which he said he had been accused of murdering “thousands of children” in a 500-page document that contained a picture of him in uniform.
Israeli military spokesperson Nadav Shoshani referenced the case in a briefing on the measures, which he said were to make sure Israeli personnel were “safe from these types of incidents” involving “anti-Israel activists around the world.”
Those at the rank of colonel and below can be filmed only from behind, with their face obscured, and only the first initial of their name can be used, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Military personnel with foreign citizenships – in combat and non-combat roles – need to have their faces obscured and cannot disclose their full names in interviews.
The new protocols apply to all combat zones, and soldiers being interviewed cannot be linked to a specific combat operation, the IDF said.
A former senior officer in Israel’s Judge Advocate General’s department told CNN last week that there was a growing number of attempts overseas to bring charges against Israelis who had served in the war, but none had resulted in arrest or trial so far.
He said activists were now going after ordinary soldiers, not just high-ranking officers and politicians.
‘Something unusual’
The new rules were announced shortly after CNN affiliate Kan aired a radio interview with the soldier who fled Brazil, in which he recounted the moment he first learned of the accusations against him.
“I got up in the morning, opened the phone and suddenly saw eight calls – the ministry of foreign affairs, my brothers, my mother, consuls,” he said in the interview, adding that it was during the call with the ministry that “we began to understand that there was a situation and something unusual.”
“They wrote that I murdered thousands of children and turned it into a 500-page document,” the soldier said of the case against him. “All that was there was a picture of me in uniform in Gaza.”
He also said that following the attention his case had gained he now hoped to “get off the radar and continue my life.”
The case against him followed a complaint brought by the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) – a group that has tracked the activities of Israeli soldiers serving in Gaza and has brought a series of other lawsuits.
A Brazilian judge then ordered police to investigate the soldier based on HRF’s complaint, which accused him of taking part in “demolitions of civilian homes in Gaza during a systematic campaign of destruction.”
The group, named after a five-year-old girl killed by Israeli tank fire in Gaza last year, is a pro-Palestinian NGO that says it is dedicated “to breaking the cycle of Israeli impunity and honoring the memory of Hind Rajab and all those who have perished in the Gaza genocide.”
The case prompted a public outcry, from opposition leaders like Yair Lapid – who called it a result of “monumental political failure” of the government – to Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar – who called the case part of a “systematic and anti-Semitic campaign aimed at denying Israel’s right to self-defense.”
A group of Israeli soldiers’ mothers wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli’s military leadership saying they would hold them to account for any legal risks their children faced from “malicious actors worldwide.”
HRF has also sought the apprehension of Israeli soldiers visiting Thailand, Sri Lanka, Chile and other countries, according to its website.

Yousef Al-Ziyadnah, 53, who was kidnapped during the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, was found dead in a tunnel in the Rafah area, a statement from the Israel Defense Forces said.
The IDF said he had been “killed in captivity” and confirmed that the dead bodies of at least two Hamas operatives were found nearby.
Al-Ziyadnah’s body was discovered alongside evidence currently under investigation by the IDF that it says raised “grave concerns” for the life of his son, Hamza Al-Ziyadnah, 23, who was also being held hostage. It did not elaborate on what that evidence was.
“We are currently investigating the circumstances” of the death, the IDF’s international spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said.
The Al-Ziyadnah family are part of the Bedouin Muslim-Arab community that lives in southern Israel’s Negev desert.
Al-Ziyadnah and three of his children – Hamza, Bilal, and Aysha – were taken from Kibbutz Holit in southwest Israel, where they used to work. Bilal and Aysha were among the dozens of hostages returned in the short-lived ceasefire deal in November 2023.
Hamza’s fate remains unknown.
Israeli authorities believe there are now 99 hostages being held in Gaza, most of whom were taken during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, cross-border attacks, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.
Of the hostages remaining in captivity in Gaza, dozens are believed to be dead.
Al-Ziyadnah had worked at the dairy farm of Kibbutz Holit for 17 years before he was taken hostage. He “was a man of dialogue and human connection, a pillar of strength for his family, and an influential figure in his community,” the Hostages Families Forum said in a statement on Wednesday.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the Al-Ziyadnah family had “received the devastating news,” and were “in deep anxiety over Hamza’s fate.”
“Time is running out. Yousef was abducted alive! Our hostages are in immediate life-threatening danger. We must continue to do everything possible to urgently return 99 of our brothers and sisters – the living to their families and the fallen and murdered to be laid to rest in dignity,” Herzog said in a statement on Wednesday.

In the footage, a man who is said to be a staff member of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, says he joined Hamas’ military wing in 2021, and that the organization and its ally, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, base themselves at hospitals because they believe the Israeli military will not target them there.
Speaking while in Israeli detention, the man appears to be under direct or implied duress. The Geneva Conventions, a set of treaties that set humanitarian rules for war, protecting civilians and soldiers, say that images of prisoners of war (POW) should not be exposed to “public curiosity.” The International Committee of the Red Cross says that that extends to videotaped interrogations: “Even if POWs appear to make voluntary public statements or willingly participate in the recording of images, disclosure to the public remains unlawful,” because “their wellbeing depends entirely on an enemy power.”
Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), which has visited some of the more than 130 Gazan medical professionals in Israeli detention, says those detained have routinely been subjected to torture – something the Israeli government denies.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have repeatedly targeted Gaza hospitals with armed drones and ground raids, alleging that Hamas uses the facilities as “command and control” centers. The military has regularly released interrogation videos with healthcare personnel detained in those raids as well as photos of small arms allegedly found at hospitals, and videos of militants operating in the vicinity of hospitals – but it has not presented conclusive evidence about a single command center located within a hospital complex.
Following an Israeli raid last month, northern Gaza’s last functioning hospital – Kamal Adwan – was forced out of operation. The military claimed that it captured 240 “Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.”
Among those detained was the head of the hospital, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, whom Israeli authorities suspect of being “a Hamas terrorist operative” – an accusation for which Israeli authorities have provided no evidence. Dr. Abu Safiya was briefly detained at the end of October but released several hours later. He now remains in Israeli detention and has been denied access to a lawyer, according to PHRI. His mother died of a heart attack this week, his family said in a statement on Tuesday.
“Israel has arrested hundreds of medical professionals,” Guy Shalev, the head of PHRI, told Al Jazeera last month. “They are still holding 130 medical professionals. We visited almost 30 of them. And they testify (about) torture, they don’t get the food and nutrition they need. They don’t get the clothes they need, mattresses to lie on. There is direct violence by prison guards. This is the day-to-day experience of prisoners in Israeli incarceration facilities.”
Doctors released from Israeli custody have alleged that they were tortured. CNN has previously reported on the grave conditions in detention.
The Israeli military has previously denied any allegations of torture in its custody but has said that any prisoner had the right to file an appeal: “The IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly.”
The US State Department says it agrees with Israel’s assessment about Hamas using hospitals as “command and control” centers. Israel’s most forceful accusation came early in the war, when it said that there was a bunker facility under Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital. When CNN was taken to the facility under IDF escort, journalists were shown a shaft at the hospital complex, but no evidence to suggest that there was a command-and-control facility.
This is not the first time the Israeli government has released a video with an interrogation of a Kamal Adwan staff member. In December 2023, Israel’s Internal Security Agency, known as Shin Bet, released an interrogation video of Ahmed Al-Kahlot, then the director of the hospital. He said that the Hamas political leadership used the hospital in the early days of the war because they felt they would not be targeted there. Dr. Al Kahlot, who was arrested in December 2023, remains in Israeli detention.
Early in the war, the Israeli military released videos that it said showed Hamas’ presence at Al-Shifa hospital, presenting security camera footage that appeared to show hostages being brought through the hospital. CNN could not independently verify the content of the videos.",['Mick Krever'],en

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has touted the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other countries as potential partners to help govern the territory after the war, but the UAE had previously said that it would refuse “to be drawn into any plan aimed at providing cover for the Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip.”
“While there have been many informal conversations taking place, parties involved have not aligned with the UAE preconditions for its involvement in any postwar effort in Gaza,” the UAE official told CNN on Tuesday.
The official was responding to a report by the Reuters news agency that behind-the-scenes discussions between the UAE, Israel and the United States included the possibility of the UAE, the US and other nations temporarily overseeing governance, security and reconstruction of Gaza after the war.
The UAE official told CNN its preconditions include a formal invitation from a “new, credible, independent” Palestinian Authority (PA) prime minister, “a serious reform process” in the PA, “an explicit commitment to the two-state solution” from Israel, and a “clear leadership role by the US.”
The UAE has long advocated for reforms within the PA, which is widely perceived as plagued by corruption, and has called for a change in its leadership. Mohammed Mustafa was sworn in as the PA’s prime minister in March, succeeding Mohammed Shtayyeh, who resigned in February.
Israeli officials have publicly rejected the possibility of the West Bank-based PA playing a role in postwar Gaza.
Reuters also reported, citing diplomats and Western officials, that UAE officials had suggested the use of private military contractors as part of a peacekeeping force in Gaza. The UAE official who spoke to CNN refuted this.
UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed met with his Israeli counterpart Gideon Sa’ar in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.
The Israeli foreign ministry said the two were set to discuss regional developments and bilateral relations. Emirati state news agency WAM said the two ministers discussed the “escalating humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip” and regional and international efforts to achieve a sustainable ceasefire.
The UAE normalized relations with Israel in a 2020 agreement known as the Abraham Accords, and has maintained relations with it over the course of the Gaza war.
Deadly strikes continue
As talks about the post-war governance of Gaza continue, so do Israeli attacks across the enclave.
Dozens of people across Gaza were killed on Tuesday, according to Palestinian authorities. At least seven were killed in strikes across refugee camps in central Gaza, at least eight in the Gaza City area, another five in northern Gaza’s Jabalya area, and at least 20 – including nine children – in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis area.
CNN stringer video from the Al Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza shows people digging through rubble that covers the ground in front of destroyed buildings and in bedrooms with missing walls.
Resident Lamees Abu Al-Rouz told CNN she was asleep when the strike hit, and that a concrete slab had fallen on her.
“I started screaming for someone to come and help me, because this cement slab was on my forehead, and I was bleeding a lot. They took me to the hospital and gave me three stiches. Because of the heavy rubble I could not move and as you can see the house is destroyed,” she said, pointing to the damaged wall and rubble behind her.
CNN stringer footage of the aftermath in Khan Younis shows rescue crews digging through blood-stained rubble.
“We came to see what happened to our neighbors, only to find that all the martyrs are children – little girls. We carried their remains, little girls covered in blood,” resident Hamed Abu Al Kas told CNN.
Yahya Sajour, 7, told CNN, “I saw so many martyrs torn apart and lifeless; men were carrying them.”
“When I hear bombardments, I always think that my siblings have died. I wish the war would end,” the child said.
The Israeli military said it had struck Khan Younis on Tuesday evening, targeting militants who took part in the October 7, 2023, attacks, and that it took steps to mitigate the risk of civilian harm. CNN has asked it for comment on the other strikes.
Gaza’s health ministry said Israeli attacks had killed at least 45,885 people since October 7, 2023, as of Tuesday. The ministry reiterated the strain hospitals in Gaza are under, with vital supplies like oxygen stations, medicine storage refrigerators and fuel for generators all severely impacted.

In a brief press statement, the ICJ said that Ireland had on Monday joined Nicaragua, Colombia, Mexico, Libya, Bolivia, Turkey, the Maldives, Chile, Spain, and the State of Palestine in asking to intervene in the case.
South Africa first filed its case against Israel in December 2023, accusing the country of committing genocide during its ongoing offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently denied that it is engaged in genocide and continues to fight South Africa in court.
Ireland’s declaration of intervention puts forward no further allegations against Israel, instead focusing on the legal framework for its involvement in South Africa’s case. Noting that the legal definition of genocide requires an “intent to destroy, in whole or in part” a target population, the document submitted by Ireland argues that intent might be inferred “in any case where a reasonable person would have foreseen that” genocide is “the natural and probable consequence of the acts of the perpetrator.”
“Ireland respectfully submits that the perpetrator does not need to have, as his or her purpose, the commission of the crime of genocide when committing any one or more of the material elements of the crime,” the declaration continues. “The crime may also be committed where a perpetrator – regardless of his or her purpose – knows (or should know) that the natural and probable consequence of these acts is either to destroy or contribute to the destruction of the protected group … and proceeds regardless.”
The Irish government previously announced its plan to intervene in the case in March 2024. Its intervention marks the latest development in its increasingly outspoken criticism of Israel’s war conduct.
Ireland had consistently criticized Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza before the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, which killed roughly 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage.
Since Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza in response, Irish politicians across the political spectrum and the public have expressed concern over what has been largely viewed as a heavy-handed response. As of Tuesday, Israeli attacks have killed at least 45,885 people in Gaza since October 7, 2023, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Relations between Ireland and Israel reached a nadir in December after Israel shuttered its embassy in Dublin. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar accused Ireland of “antisemitic rhetoric” in an official statement, claiming that “Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel.”
At the time, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris described Israel’s decision as “deeply regrettable.”
Much of Ireland’s sympathy for the plight of Palestinians emerges from the country’s centuries-old subjugation by its British neighbors. In Northern Ireland, which is still under British rule, nationalist communities regularly fly the Palestinian flag – and some loyalists fly the Israeli flag in response.
Israel’s current president, Isaac Herzog, has Irish roots. His father, also a famous Israeli politician, was born in Belfast. Herzog’s grandfather, Isaac HaLevi Herzog, was Chief Rabbi of the Irish Free State – the precursor to the current Republic of Ireland – and later served as Chief Rabbi of Israel.",['Max Saltman'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/06/middleeast/west-bank-shooting-israel-intl-latam/index.html,Violence surges in West Bank as three Israelis killed and reprisals reported,2025-01-06 22:46:28,"Multiple Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians have been reported in parts of the occupied West Bank after gunmen killed three Israelis and injured eight others earlier on Monday in the latest explosion of violence there.
While tensions have been rising in the West Bank for years, the October 7 attacks by Hamas and the subsequent Israeli assault on Gaza has ushered in a volatile new chapter in the occupied territory.
Attacks on Palestinian communities by Israeli settlers, emboldened by their country’s offensive in Gaza and support from Israel’s right-wing government, have increased – while there have also been attacks against the settlers.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli vehicles were targeted on Route 55 in Al-Funduq, a Palestinian village in the West Bank, according to Israeli authorities. The road, which snakes through the northern West Bank, passes through the Jewish settlement of Kedumim.
Two women in one car were shot dead and a man in a second car 160 yards away died of gunshot wounds, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. Israeli authorities said the women were residents of the Jewish settlement of Kedumim in the northern West Bank, and the man lived in northern Israel and worked as a police investigator in the West Bank.
A further eight people were injured in the attack, including the bus driver, who was shot in his limbs and abdomen, according to the MDA.
The deadly shooting sent tensions soaring and within hours the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported multiple attacks on Palestinians.
In the northern West Bank, Israeli settlers set fire to a vehicle in the town of Hajja, and carried out attacks in Far’ata and Amatin villages, according to WAFA, where Israeli settlers reportedly threw stones at people’s homes and destroyed crops. Citing locals, WAFA reported that Israeli forces fired at men of the village of Amatin as they tried to confront the violence by settlers. The Israeli military told CNN it was unaware of the event.
On the incident in Hajja, the Israeli military said they received several reports on Monday evening of “Israeli civilians who entered the village” and had “caused damage to property” and Israeli came to the scene.
WAFA also reported an increase of Israeli military reinforcements in the area, with additional checkpoints, road closure and incursions into towns. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the claim.
Two more incidents were reported southeast of Ramallah where Israeli settlers set fire to an agricultural room in the town of Turmus Ayya on Monday evening, according to security sources who told WAFA. Meanwhile Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian vehicles with stones near Bethlehem, according to WAFA.
‘Settle accounts’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation following the attack by gunmen earlier in the day. In a statement on X, he pledged to “find the abhorrent murderers and settle accounts with them and with all those who aided them. No one will get away.”
Netanyahu is expected to hold a cabinet meeting on Tuesday and discuss the West Bank.
While there has been no claim of responsibility yet for the shooting, it has been praised by the Palestinian militant group Hamas and been labelled a “terrorist attack” by Israel.
Speaking at the scene, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief Herzi Halevi said the “clock is ticking” for the attackers, and vowed to track down those responsible, make the route safer, and intensify Israel’s “intense and wide-ranging” operations “against terrorism” in the occupied West Bank.
Israeli authorities later identified the two women as Aliza Reiss and Rachel Cohen – two civilian residents of the Jewish settlement of Kedumim, both in their 70s – and the man as Yaakov Winkelstein, a police investigator.
Rephaela Segal, assistant mayor of Kedumim, described the women as “young in nature” and said Cohen had been volunteering as a special education teacher in her retirement. Reiss was a counselor at a high school in a nearby settlement, Karnei Shomron, and both were traveling to Karnei Shomron at the time of the attack, Segal said.
This isn’t the first time in recent months that violence has broken out in this part of the West Bank. In August 2024, a group of 30 armed Israeli settlers attacked Jit, a Palestinian town just 10 minutes from Kedumim. They fired bullets, tear gas and set homes and cars on fire, according to residents who witnessed the attack.
Volatile new chapter
Recent international focus on the region has been largely on Israel’s military operations in Gaza. But another major escalation of violence has been playing out around 60 miles away in the Israeli-occupied West Bank where 3.3 million Palestinians are living under Israeli military occupation surrounded by hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Such Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law and by much of the international community.
According to the UN, more than 500 Palestinian civilians were killed in the West Bank during 2024, with children bearing much of the violence. The UN said in December that 2024 had been a deadlier year for Palestinian children in the West Bank than the prior seven years combined. Since the October 7 attacks in 2023, at least 169 children have been killed by Israeli forces and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the UN.
Meanwhile, 2024 was the third-deadliest year for Israelis in the West Bank since data collection began in 2008, according to the UN, which recorded the deaths of 34 Israelis – 15 soldiers and 19 civilians. Of those civilians, seven were settlers.
In August, the US announced sanctions against an Israeli organization, Hashomer Yosh, allegedly responsible for supporting settler violence in the West Bank against Palestinians, according to a State Department spokesperson.
Attacks have also come as the Israeli government ramped up approvals of Israeli settler housing. In July, Israel’s government approved a large land seizure in the occupied West Bank – the biggest since the 1993 Oslo Accords set out a path for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, according to the Israeli rights group Peace Now. The area was converted to state land, according to a document from the body, but the official notice wasn’t posted until days after, Peace Now said.
On Wednesday, the Israeli government is due to hold a construction planning meeting to discuss Israeli settlements housing approvals, the sixth consecutive week of Settlement Contruction Planning Meetings, according to Peace Now.
“The shift to weekly planning meetings represents both a normalization and intensification of settlement construction,” Peace Now said, adding that if the coming plans are approved, “the six-week total will reach 2,377 housing units. At this rate, 2025 could set new records, with projections exceeding 1,500 units per month,” Peace Now said, adding that it’s as a result of “policy changes” that have been introduced by Netanyahu and the current government.

The case is the latest in a series of lawsuits brought by the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) that has tracked the activities of hundreds of Israeli soldiers serving in Gaza.
Last week, a Brazilian judge ordered police to investigate the soldier, based on the complaint brought by the HRF, accusing him of “participating in massive demolitions of civilian homes in Gaza during a systematic campaign of destruction.”
The lawyer who brought the case on behalf of the foundation, Maira Pinheiro, told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Monday that before the federal police could launch the investigation, “the Israeli government intervened to help him evade Brazilian authorities, which is very telling to his exceptionality.”
Pinheiro was quoted in Brazilian media as saying that as Brazil is a signatory to the Rome Statute, it is obliged to ensure that the crimes provided for in the statute (war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide) are investigated and punished.
The HRF is a pro-Palestinian NGO that says it is dedicated “to breaking the cycle of Israeli impunity and honoring the memory of Hind Rajab and all those who have perished in the Gaza genocide.” Rajab was a 5-year-old girl who was killed by Israeli tank fire while in her family’s car in Gaza.
The Israeli foreign ministry said Sunday that “following an attempt last weekend by anti-Israeli elements to investigate a discharged Israeli soldier who visited Brazil, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar immediately activated the Foreign Ministry to ensure that the Israeli citizen was not in danger.”
The Israeli embassy in Brazil had ensured “his swift and safe departure from Brazil.”
The foreign ministry added that it drew Israelis’ attention “to posts made by them on social media regarding their military service, and to the fact that anti-Israeli elements may exploit these posts to initiate baseless legal proceedings against them.”
Pinheiro said that HRF presented proof to Brazilian authorities that the Israeli soldier and members of his battalion had “posted about being involved in the controlled demolition of multiple residential homes,” among other evidence in the case.
She told CNN that HRF verified the evidence with a team of open-source intelligence investigators, “which is nowadays one of the main ways that international crimes and international human rights violations are being investigated.”
HRF has also sought the apprehension of Israeli soldiers visiting Thailand, Sri Lanka, Chile and other countries, according to its website. In the Sri Lankan case, the organization posted a photograph of the soldier and said that it had appealed to Sri Lankan authorities, the International Criminal Court and Interpol, demanding his arrest over the killing of a civilian in Gaza.
There is no confirmation that any Israeli soldier has been detained or arrested as a result of the cases it has brought.
The Brazilian case has kicked off a political furor in Israel. The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, said: “The fact that an Israeli reserve soldier had to flee Brazil in the middle of the night to avoid being arrested for fighting in Gaza is a monumental political failure of a government that is simply incapable of functioning.”
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar shot back, saying: “Even the empty Lapid knows that what we are witnessing is a systematic and anti-Semitic campaign aimed at denying Israel’s right to self-defense. Countless international actors and many countries are complicit in this.”
“Moms Up,” a group of Israeli soldiers’ mothers, has written to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF Chief of Staff following the case in Brazil, saying: “We see you as the sole responsible party for removing the legal risk facing our children.”
It added that the Israeli military had been “forced to operate within a political vacuum and under pressure from extremist groups, without the vital legal protection that would safeguard its soldiers from malicious actors worldwide.”
A former senior officer in Israel’s Judge Advocate General’s department told CNN that there was a rising number of attempts overseas to bring charges against Israelis who served in the war, but so far none had resulted in arrest or trial.
He said that unlike in the past, activist groups were not going after high-ranking officers and politicians but ordinary soldiers. The lawyer declined to be identified for this report.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/05/middleeast/hamas-hostages-list-israel-intl-latam/index.html,"Hamas approves list of Israeli hostages for potential exchange, Reuters reports",2025-01-05 19:36:17,"Hamas has approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be exchanged in a possible ceasefire deal, Reuters reported, citing a Hamas official.
The Israeli government denied receiving a list of hostages from Hamas, adding that the names published in the media are from an older list that Israel had presented to mediators.
“Contrary to what was claimed, Hamas has yet to provide a list of hostages,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.
“The list of hostages published in the media was not provided to Israel by Hamas but was originally transferred from Israel to the mediators back in July 2024,” Netanyahu’s office said. “So far, Israel has not received any confirmation or response from Hamas regarding the status of the hostages on the list.”
Reuters reported on Sunday, citing an unidentified Hamas official, that the release of the hostages would be contingent on reaching an agreement regarding Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire.
Israel and Hamas are also negotiating the number and identities of Palestinian prisoners and detainees who would be released in exchange for the hostages.
It is not clear which hostages are on the list reported by Reuters, or whether they are living or dead. In recent weeks, Israel has told CNN they have yet to receive a full list of living hostages from the militant group.
This comes just days after indirect negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal resumed in the Qatari capital Doha, talks that have so far shown few signs of progress, according to Israeli and Egyptian officials.
A source familiar with the matter told CNN that despite reports of new “optimism” around talks, “there is not much new, slow progress for now.”
White House Middle East adviser Brett McGurk is among the officials in Doha, a US official and another person familiar with the matter told CNN. Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer is expected to travel to Washington this week and meet with Biden administration and Trump transition officials, according to an Israeli source.
“What we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks is a re-intensified engagement, including by Hamas, but we have yet to see agreement on the final points,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters during a trip to South Korea on Monday. “We very much want to bring this over the finish line in the next two weeks, the time we have remaining.”
On Saturday, Hamas turned up the pressure on Israel at the negotiating table, releasing a video of 19-year-old hostage Liri Albag.
Albag’s family called on Netanyahu to seize the opportunity for a ceasefire deal, describing the footage as having “torn our hearts to pieces.”
As of December 5, Hamas was still holding 100 hostages in Gaza, most of whom were abducted during the militant group’s October 7, 2023, cross-border attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Of the hostages remaining in captivity in Gaza, at least 36 are believed to be dead, according to Netanyahu’s office.
CNN has reached out to Hamas and the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum for comment.
Attacks continue
While negotiations in Doha are underway, Israeli attacks in Gaza continued on Sunday.
Israeli strikes on a residential building in northern Gaza killed 12 members of the same family, with more trapped under the rubble, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense.
Four airstrikes targeted the house of the Zuhd family in the district of Sheikh Radwan, north of Gaza City, the Civil Defense said.
CNN footage from the strike’s aftermath shows people desperately digging through the wreckage for survivors. Ammar Zuhd told CNN that a child was pulled out alive from the rubble and 11 other people were missing.
The footage also shows a young man’s lifeless body hanging suspended from an upper floor of the house. “This is my nephew; do you see how he is hanging? He was a young man who hadn’t yet married; he was just starting his life at 20 years old,” Zuhd said.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the target of the strikes.
Local Palestinians told CNN they fear the Sheikh Radwan area is turning into a “red zone” amid the destruction.
“They attack us every day now, with missiles and bombs dropped by drones among the people. Everyone is at risk of being bombed at any moment,” Wissam Zuhd said.
The director of Gaza City’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital said it had been overwhelmed tending to casualties.
“Operating rooms are packed with critically injured patients, hallways filled with those waiting for surgery, and beds occupied by the suffering. The gate is crowded with bodies for burial,” Dr. Fadel Naim posted to X.
“We’ve never witnessed such horrors,” he said, adding that if the Israeli attacks did not end soon, the hospital would “no longer be able to handle the influx of victims.”
Gaza’s health ministry reported Sunday that 88 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours, bringing the cumulative death toll of Israel’s war on Hamas to at least 45,805 people, with more than 109,000 injured in the enclave as a result of Israeli military operations since October 2023.","['Hira Humayun', 'Lauren Izso']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/middleeast/israel-gaza-hussam-abu-safiya-high-court-petition-intl/index.html,Israeli government pressed to reveal location of detained Gaza hospital director,2025-01-03 10:11:15,"A human rights group has filed a petition with Israel’s top court demanding to know the whereabouts of a prominent Palestinian hospital director detained by the Israeli military.
Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya has not been seen publicly since he was arrested during an Israeli raid last week that closed Kamal Adwan Hospital – the last major functioning health facility in northern Gaza.
Recently released former detainees told CNN on Monday that Dr. Abu Safiya is being held along with other medics from the hospital at Sde Teiman – a notorious military base in Israel’s Negev desert that doubles as a detention facility.
Physicians for Human Rights - Israel (PHRI) said in a statement Thursday that it filed the petition with the High Court after receiving a response to an inquiry from the Israeli military claiming that it had “found no indication of the arrest or detention of the individual in question.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has since told CNN that Dr. Abu Safiya “was apprehended for suspected involvement in terrorist activities, and for holding a rank in the Hamas terror organization, while hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were hiding inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital under his management. He is currently being investigated by Israeli security forces.”
It made similar allegations about the hospital and its director around the time of the raid on the facility, without providing evidence for the claims.
PHRI said Sunday that it had requested a lawyer meet with Dr. Abu Safiya, so that the lawyer, named Nasser Ouda, could assess his condition and the circumstances of his detention.
According to PHRI, the Israeli military said that Ouda, who regularly visits Palestinian detainees held in Israeli prisons, was prohibited from meeting with Dr. Abu Safiya until January 10. The IDF has also not provided any official information regarding Dr. Abu Safiya’s location, PHRI said Sunday.
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
Israeli forces launched an aerial and ground incursion in several parts of northern Gaza in early October, saying they were targeting Hamas’ renewed presence there. The onslaught has razed streets into carpets of debris, killed entire families, and severely depleted food, water and medical stocks.
Before the raid on December 27, the Israeli military had fired on Kamal Adwan Hospital on a daily basis, and raided the facility at least six times since October 5, Dr Abu Safiya told CNN.
In the months prior, the Palestinian doctor was in regular contact with CNN, and issued updates about impact of attacks on patients and medical workers at Kamal Adwan Hospital. Dr. Abu Safiya repeatedly called for the protection of health care facilities in Gaza.
In another development, the Israeli military on Friday ordered patients and staff members inside northern Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital to evacuate, despite the fact that many patients cannot walk, a nurse at the hospital told CNN.
The Indonesian Hospital, which is “out of function” according to the World Health Organization, opened its doors to 23 people including patients and staff who were forced out of Kamal Adwan Hospital.
The nurse, Rawiya Hussein Tamboora, told CNN, the group were being forced out of hospital again, including elderly patients and people with broken legs.
“The Israeli military is around us burning homes and houses… all day there is gunfire hitting the windows and walls,” the nurse said.
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
‘Great risk of torture’
On Thursday, UN experts said they were “gravely concerned” about the fate of Dr. Abu Safiya, and called on Israeli authorities, as the occupying power in Gaza, to “respect and protect the right to life.”
“The heroic actions of Palestinian medical colleagues in Gaza, teach us what it means to have taken the medical oath. They are also a clear signal of a depraved humanity that has allowed a genocide to continue for well over a year,” the experts said in a statement.
More than 1,057 Palestinian health and medical professionals have been killed in Gaza, according to the statement.
PHRI said it had “highlighted (to the High Court) that this case is part of a broader pattern of non-disclosure and unreliable information provided by the Israeli military and prison authorities regarding Palestinian detainees.”
Amnesty International secretary general Agnes Callamard said on X on Thursday that the rights group is “extremely alarmed by the latest information we have received regarding the whereabouts of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiyyah.”
She added that he is “at great risk of torture and ill-treatment,” demanding that Israel reveal where he is.
An Arab Knesset member has sent a letter to Israel’s Minister of Defense Israel Katz, calling on authorities to disclose Dr. Abu Safiya’s whereabouts and asking on what charges he is being held.
Dr. Ahmed Tibi asked to visit the Palestinian hospital director “as soon as possible” in light of “numerous reports of torture in detention facilities, and the dozens of detainees who have died in recent months.”

Both Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly accused each other of violating the terms of the agreement although it has largely been holding.
The two parties agreed to stop hostilities for at least 60 days from November 27. In this time, Hezbollah fighters were expected to retreat 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdrew from Lebanese territory.
The ceasefire deal stipulated that, before January 26, the only armed groups present south of the Litani should be the Lebanese military and UN peacekeeping forces.
On Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said: “If Hezbollah does not withdraw beyond the Litani River, there will be no agreement.
“Israel seeks to uphold the agreement in Lebanon and will continue to enforce it fully and without compromise in order to ensure the safe return of northern residents to their homes,” Katz said, according to his spokesperson.
“But the first condition for the agreement’s implementation is the complete withdrawal of the Hezbollah terrorist organization beyond the Litani River, the dismantling of all weapons, and the dismantling of terrorist infrastructure in the area by the Lebanese army – something that has not yet happened,” he continued.
Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem said in a speech on Saturday that it was up to the group to decide whether or not it would abide by the 60 day period.
“Our patience (regarding Israeli violations of the ceasefire) might run out or it may persist as it is now … and when we decide to act, you will see it immediately.”
Tit-for-tat strikes have occurred on multiple occasions after the truce was implemented. Israel has conducted numerous operations in southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah has fired at Israeli-occupied territory, citing Israeli truce violations.
Less than a week after it went into effect, the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said Israel had breached the ceasefire agreement “approximately 100” times.
On Saturday, UNIFIL said that peacekeepers had seen a bulldozer belonging to the Israeli military “destroying a blue barrel marking the line of withdrawal between Lebanon and Israel in Labbouneh, as well as an observation tower belonging to the Lebanese Armed Forces immediately beside a UNIFIL position there.”
The Israel Defense Forces’ “deliberate and direct destruction of both clearly identifiable UNIFIL property and infrastructure belonging to the Lebanese Armed Forces is a flagrant violation of resolution 1701 (a 2006 resolution calling for a full cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah) and international law,” UNIFIL said.

Since October 7, Israel has been waging war in Gaza trying to dismantle Hamas militarily, but says the militants retain governing capacity through seizing aid. Such a move risks exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation.
“The humanitarian aid is not reaching the right hands,” the official said, who added it was one of “several” options currently being considered.
Relief organizations have consistently called for an increase in the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into the besieged strip, warning for months of the rising risk of famine for civilians.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update on Tuesday that only 2,205 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the month of December, excluding commercial vehicles and fuel.
Israel disputed that number, saying there is no limit on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza and that over 5,000 trucks had entered over the course of the month, according to a statement from the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which manages the flow of aid into the strip.
UN officials say the number of trucks entering Gaza before the war was approximately 500 per day, or 15,000 per month.
An estimated 91% of the territory’s 2.1 million residents are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to OCHA.
In October, less than a month before the US presidential election, the Biden administration sent a letter to the Israeli government demanding it act to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy.
The list of demands included allowing at least 350 trucks a day to enter Gaza while implementing combat pauses to enhance the flow and security for humanitarian convoys and movements.
A week after Trump won the election and the deadline expired, the Biden administration assessed that Israel was not blocking aid, despite key demands contained within the letter remaining unmet.

The State Department sent the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee the informal notification of the sale on Friday, the first day of the new Congress and just weeks before the Biden administration leaves office. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year accused the Biden administration of withholding weapons to Israel – a claim a Biden envoy called “unproductive” and “more importantly, completely untrue.”
Israel continues to face accusations from human rights groups of violations of international law, including in its use of US weapons, in its war with Hamas in Gaza, where tens of thousands have been killed. In May, the State Department said it was “reasonable to assess” that US weapons had been used by Israeli forces in Gaza in ways that are “inconsistent” with international humanitarian law but stopped short of officially saying Israel had violated the law.
The proposed sale, which was first reported on by Axios, includes AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles to be used against airborne threats, including drones, the US official said. It also includes artillery shells; Hellfire AGM-114 missiles; Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs); JDAM tail kits; 500-pound warheads; and FMU-152A/B bomb fuses, the sources said.
The US official said the proposed sale is intended “to support Israel’s long-term security by resupplying stocks of critical munitions and air defense capabilities.”
“The president has made clear Israel has a right to defend its citizens, consistent with international law and international humanitarian law, and to deter aggression from Iran and its proxy organizations,” they told CNN. “We will continue to provide the capabilities necessary for Israel’s defense.”
The official also noted that some production and delivery of the munitions cases can be fulfilled through current US stock, but “the majority will take upwards of a year to several years to deliver.”
The informal notification process is a common practice in which the relevant congressional committees – in this case House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations – get a heads up on planned sales, allowing committee leadership to raise concerns, give their input or place holds.",['Jennifer Hansler'],en

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to hold a meeting Friday to discuss the “mandate of the delegation,” his spokesperson confirmed.
Professional-level representatives from the Israel Security Agency (ISA), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, known as Mossad, will travel to the Qatari capital of Doha for the talks, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Thursday.
Hamas has also said indirect negotiations will resume in Doha, Qatar, on Friday, emphasizing “its seriousness” to reach a deal.
Hamas “confirms, as every time, its seriousness, positivity, and its endeavor to reach an agreement at the earliest opportunity that achieves the aspirations and goals of our steadfast and patient people,” the militant group said in a statement.
According to Hamas, this round of talks “will focus on the agreement leading to a complete ceasefire, the withdrawal of the occupation forces from the Gaza Strip and the details of implementation, and the return of the displaced to their homes from which they were expelled in all areas of the Strip,” according to the group’s statement.
Qatar has not released a statement on the resumption of talks in its capital.
Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have carried on even as official negotiations have been deadlocked for months as the administration of US President Joe Biden pushed for a deal to be reached.
A diplomatic source familiar with the matter told CNN in December that the deal is broadly the same as the proposal put forth by Biden earlier in 2024.
The three-phase Biden proposal in late May paired a release of hostages held in Gaza with a “full and complete ceasefire.”
The first phase would last six weeks and include the “withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza” and the “release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners,” the US president had said.
“What has changed is that Israeli forces are likely to stay in Gaza temporarily,” when phase one of a deal starts, the diplomatic source said, namely in the strip of land on the Gaza-Egypt border, called the Philadelphi corridor, and in an area bisecting the strip, known as the Netzarim corridor.
Israel’s demand that its troops remain along the Philadelphi corridor – and Hamas’ insistence that they withdraw – was a key reason for the collapse of talks in August.
Months later, in November, Qatar announced that it had paused its role as a ceasefire mediator due to a lack of willingness by the sides to reach an agreement.
Both parties have blamed the other for talks stalling as recently as last week when Hamas said Israel had set “new issues and conditions” on the terms of a deal and Netanyahu accused Hamas of “reneging on understandings.”
However, sources within Hamas and Israel have voiced cautious optimism in December about the prospects of reaching a deal.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of hostages, praised the news about renewed talks but also pushed for urgency. “We cannot miss this window of opportunity! The 100 hostages being held in the depths of Hamas tunnels in Gaza don’t have time for delays in the negotiations,” the forum said on X on Thursday.
Humanitarian crisis continues
During a temporary ceasefire deal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt at the end of 2023, more than 100 hostages were released over a period of several weeks in exchange for the release of Palestinians jailed in Israel.
Israel continued to wage war on the enclave when the ceasefire talks stalled last year.
At least 45,581 Palestinians have been killed and more than 108,400 people injured since the war began, Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported on Thursday. Israel began the war in response to Hamas killing more than 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 250 on October 7, 2023.
Ensuing Israeli airstrikes on the enclave have hit homes, hospitals, and designated humanitarian areas, causing those already displaced by the heavy bombardment to then flee again amid harsh winter conditions.
Israeli forces recently surrounded the last functioning major hospital in northern Gaza before arresting its director. The Israeli military has described its actions as a response to the reported resurgence of Hamas operations in the area which CNN is unable to independently confirm.
Meanwhile, humanitarian aid trickles into Gaza, leading to widespread shortages of food, shelter, and other live-saving supplies. The UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), among other organizations, has repeatedly called for more aid to be admitted.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/02/middleeast/israeli-strike-kills-gaza-police-chief-intl/index.html,"Israeli strike kills 11 people, including head of Gaza police, Palestinian officials say",2025-01-02 00:00:00,"An Israeli strike killed at least 11 Palestinians overnight, including the director general of Gaza police and a deputy, in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, local officials said Thursday.
Gaza’s interior ministry accused Israel of killing Maj. Gen. Mahmoud Salah, aged 50 and a father-of-four, and Maj. Gen. Hussam Shahwan, a member of the Police Command Council, to undermine law and order in the Palestinian territory.
“By committing the crime of assassinating the Director General of Police in the Gaza Strip, the occupation is insisting on spreading chaos in the Strip and deepening the human suffering of citizens,” the ministry said in a Thursday statement.
The Israeli military said it killed Shahwan, the deputy, on Thursday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that Shahwan was a “terrorist” who was “responsible for developing intelligence assessments in coordination with elements of Hamas’ military wing” in Gaza. The IDF did not acknowledge Salah’s killing in its statement.
The Israeli offensive since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks in 2023 has eroded law infrastructure in Gaza. The presence of heavily armed groups has also stifled relief efforts in a territory besieged by Israel’s sustained aid restrictions and severe hunger, disease and mass displacement. Palestinian police have played a key role in ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian aid.
But human rights agencies have repeatedly warned that Israel’s sustained aid restrictions have strangled relief operations in the enclave, citing lengthy truck inspections, damaged roads, strikes on aid convoys and impeded access to the north.
In November, the United Nations warned of a “collapse of law and order” leading to dozens of trucks being looted at gunpoint. A few days later, the chief of the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees stressed that Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure that aid flows safely into Gaza.
Israel’s war in Gaza has erased entire families, decimated the health care system and reduced entire neighborhoods to debris. At least 45,581 Palestinians have been killed and more than 108,400 people injured, the Ministry of Health there reported on Thursday.
‘We’ve grown up with bombings’
Men, women and children tried to recover survivors from the wreckage of Israel’s bombardment on Thursday.
CNN footage from the aftermath showed residents holding white bags filled with the dismembered body parts of those killed. Blood splatters can be seen marking the ground.
“We heard a whistling sound, and we covered the baby with our bodies. The entire tent turned into chaos. We didn’t know where the strikes were coming from,” Jana Abdel Aal, an 11-year-old girl, told CNN.
“The entire area was filled with smoke,” she said. “The Israelis didn’t warn us. We were sitting and suddenly heard whistling and then, boom — the tent was destroyed. No warning, nothing.”
Jana told CNN she struggled to protect her two-day-old baby brother, Sanad, from clouds of dust, adding that he “was moments away from dying.”
“He was on the verge of suffocating. We took him outside, away from the area, and he finally breathed some air,” added Jana.
“For 11 years, we’ve known nothing but humiliation. We’ve grown up with bombings, injuries, and burials,” she said. “I don’t expect anything for the future. I have no hope left – not in life, not in anything.”
The area was “full of civilians, including displaced children” when it was hit, according to the head of rescue operations at Gaza’s Civil Defense.
“Almost nothing remained of the building – it was completely destroyed,” Aqil Al-Hajjaj told CNN on Thursday. “(The building) was hit by six or seven missiles as if it were encircled by fire.”
Al-Mawasi, a coastal region west of Rafah, previously designated by Israel as a “humanitarian area,” has repeatedly come under Israeli attacks. Thousands of displaced Palestinians have moved there in search of refuge, living for months in makeshift tents made of cloth and nylon.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl/index.html,"Gaza’s population is falling, while Israel’s growth is slowing",2025-01-01 15:44:37,"Gaza’s population dropped by 6% – about 160,000 people – in 2024, according to a new report, as Israel’s war against Hamas took a heavy toll on the Palestinian enclave’s demographics.
The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said in a report released Tuesday that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks in the strip, according to official figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave.
The report also warned 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza were “endangered” due to the lack of adequate healthcare and 96% of the population were facing high levels of food insecurity.
Gaza’s population now stands at 2.1 million, including more than a million children under the age of 18, making up 47% of the population, PCBS’s report added.
Meanwhile, a separate report by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) found that Israel’s population was still growing – but more slowly than before – in a trend it attributed to Israelis leaving the country.
The Israeli report cautioned, however, that the full impact of Israel’s multi-front war on long-term migration pattern was yet to be seen.
In the report published Tuesday, the census office said that in 2024, Israel’s population grew by 1.1%, compared to 1.6% in 2023.
“The decrease is mainly due to the high number of Israelis emigrating from Israel in 2024,” it said, adding that last year, some 82,700 residents left Israel, compared to 55,000 the year before.
By December 31, 2024, Israel’s population was estimated at 10.027 million, the report said, topping the 10-million mark for the first time. However, the report included foreign nationals in the country as part of its count.
Israel has also been rocked by political turmoil. In 2023, it was shaken by mass protests against controversial plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to overhaul the country’s judicial system.
It then launched a war on Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group led brutal attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 on October 7, 2023. Israel’s attacks since then have killed more than 45,000 people and injured 108,000 in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip.
Israel is also fighting against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, which began firing at Israel on October 8, 2023, as well as conflicts with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria and Iraq who say they are attacking Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Dana Karni', 'Kareem El Damanhoury']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/palestinian-authority-freezes-al-jazeera-west-bank-intl-latam/index.html,Palestinian Authority freezes Al Jazeera operations in the West Bank,2025-01-02 00:22:06,"The Palestinian Authority has suspended Al Jazeera from broadcasting and operating in the occupied West Bank.
It accused the network of broadcasting “inciting materials” and “misleading reports” that “provoke strife and interfere in Palestinian internal affairs,” Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, said Wednesday.
“The decision also includes the temporary suspension of all journalists and staff associated with it, as well as the channels under its umbrella, until its legal status is rectified, due to Al Jazeera’s violation of the laws and regulations in force in Palestine,” the Palestinian news agency said.
Al Jazeera condemned the decision, calling it “in line with the practices of the occupation against its crews.”
A video from Al Jazeera shows three Palestinian law enforcement personnel entering a hotel room in Ramallah, in the central West Bank, and handing a letter to journalist Najwan Simri, who then signs it. The letter signed by the Palestinian Authority’s attorney general Akram Al-Khateeb, orders the “banning and freezing of all operations of Al Jazeera Satellite channel and its office in Palestine and freezing the work of all journalists working with the station, crews and affiliate channels temporarily until its situation is corrected due to [Al Jazeera’s] violation of the provisions of the laws and regulations.”
CNN has reached out to the Palestinian Authority for details on the reason behind the decision, and how long the ban will be in effect.
This marks the first time the network has faced such restrictions from Palestinian officials, including the Palestinian Authority which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.
However, Israeli officials have repeatedly attempted to stifle the news network, shutting down its operations in May, seizing equipment, and stopping broadcasts.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has long complained about Al Jazeera’s operations, alleging anti-Israeli bias and accusing the network of being a “mouthpiece for Hamas.” Al Jazeera has rejected the claims as “unfounded allegations.”
Months after shutting down the network’s Jerusalem office, Israeli forces raided and shut down its Ramallah office in the occupied West Bank in September. Al Jazeera said it would “continue reporting on the war on Gaza and the ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories and the regional escalation.” Since then, employees from Al Jazeera have used the title of “journalist” rather than “network correspondent” when reporting from the West Bank.
Following Monday’s announcement by the Palestinian Authority, Al Jazeera reiterated its “commitment to continue covering events and developments in the West Bank with full professionalism.”
The decision came from the Palestinian Authority’s specialized ministerial committee, which includes the Ministries of Culture, Interior, and Communications, according to Wafa. Lawyers like Muhannad Karajah from Lawyers for Justice – an independent Ramallah-based Palestinian group of lawyers – have challenged the legality of the order which did not come from a judicial ruling.
A controversial operation
In its statement on Monday, Al Jazeera said it “views the Palestinian Authority’s decision as an attempt to deter it from covering the escalating events taking place in the occupied territories.”
“The closure decision comes in the wake of a continuous campaign of incitement and intimidation from entities sponsored by the Palestinian Authority against our journalists,” the news network said. It called the decision “an attempt to conceal the truth of events in the occupied territories, especially in Jenin and its camp.”
The Qatari-based news network, which has produced dogged, on-the-ground reporting of Israel’s war in Gaza, has also extensively covered an operation by Palestinian security forces that began in December, in the occupied West Bank to combat what they describe as extremist “outlaws” in Jenin. The fighting between the Palestinian Authority’s security forces and Palestinian militant groups aligned with Hamas – who accuse the authority of selling out to Israel - has been highly controversial.
Al Jazeera was also criticized by the Palestinian Authority following the network’s coverage of the killing of Palestinian journalist Shatha Sabbagh, whose family accused Palestinian security forces of shooting her in the head on Saturday during their Jenin operation.
In a virtual interview on Sunday with Al Jazeera anchor Ahmed Taha, alongside Sabbagh’s mother, the spokesperson for the Palestinian security forces Anwar Rajab said he was not notified he would be on air with the mother. After listening to her for about three and a half minutes, in which she accused the security forces of killing her daughter, Rajab offered his condolences and then accused Al Jazeera of being “unprofessional” and “taking advantage of people’s suffering and pain.”
After an apology from the anchor for not notifying the spokesperson beforehand, Rajab said the security forces were not responsible for the killing of Shatha Sabbagh and said investigations were ongoing. Following a further heated exchange with the anchor, Rajab accused Al Jazeera of “inciting and leading sedition” before leaving the interview.
Widespread condemnation
Al Jazeera said it was “astonished” by the Palestinian Authority’s decision and said the authority is “fully responsible” for the safety of the network’s staff in the West Bank. The network demanded the authority revoke their decision and allow teams to continue their coverage in the area “without intimidation.”
Others across the Palestinian territories echoed Al Jazeera’s calls for rescinding the decision.
Independent Palestinian politician and head of the Palestinian National Initiative Mostafa Al Barghouti said the network’s Palestinian reporters “face continuous assaults from the occupation” and said the order against it “does not benefit the Palestinian people or their just cause, nor does it benefit those who made this decision.”
The order also drew condemnation from the Palestinian Journalists’ Protection Center, a Ramallah-based NGO that called the decision a “shameful assault on press freedom.”
Hamas condemned the decision as “illegal and unjustified.”","['Abeer Salman', 'Hira Humayun', 'Kareem El Damanhoury']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/middleeast/gaza-winter-palestinians-intl-latam/index.html,‘We’re dying from the cold’: Displaced Palestinians battle winter in Gaza,2025-01-01 00:43:48,"Standing barefoot in the mud with an empty container in hand at a crowded water station in central Gaza, Palestinian Alaa Al-Shawish is fearing the winter weather and looking for clean water for her family.
Her family are living in a makeshift tent in Deir Al-Balah, after being displaced from Gaza City amid heavy Israeli bombardment. But their new home holds deadly perils of its own.
“We’re dying from the cold. This is not life, this is not living – I pray every day that we die to be relieved from this life,” Alaa says as she fights back tears. “No food, no water, no life.”
Several Palestinians, including at least five babies, have died in recent days due to severe cold weather. The UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) warned on Tuesday that “more babies will likely die” in the coming days.
The babies who died from hypothermia were all under one month old, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. A 2-year-old has also died from the cold in recent days, health officials said.
“I am watching my children die before my eyes,” says Yahya Al-Batran, the father of 20-day-old Jumaa, who died on Sunday. “He died from the cold, he froze,” he adds as he holds his child’s lifeless body at the hospital.
The cold weather has not only claimed the lives of children. On Friday, the health ministry said a nurse was found dead in his tent in Al-Mawasi on Friday due to severe cold.
Temperatures in Gaza can reach lows of 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by wind and rain.
Flooded makeshift tents
The winter has also brought with it heavy rainfall that has flooded tents housing displaced Palestinians across Gaza over the past couple of days.
The Gaza Civil Defense says it received hundreds of distress calls on Monday and Tuesday from displaced Palestinian families whose tents and shelters have been flooded in Al-Mawasi, Rafah, Deir Al-Balah and central Gaza City, among other locations across the strip.
More than 1,500 tents were flooded with over 30cm of rainwater, the Civil Defense said, damaging the little that people have and soaking bedding and belongs. Hundreds of other tents were also damaged by the rain and unusable until the water recedes.
CNN footage taken in Deir Al-Balah on Tuesday shows pools of water in the roads in between tents, children and adults shoveling mud. Mattresses, rugs, and clothes are soaking wet inside tents made of cloth and nylon.
More than 100 tents in Khan Younis have been extensively damaged by the heavy rain, UNRWA said on Tuesday.
“Displaced people, already living through the unlivable due to the war, are now battling heavy rainstorms,” UNRWA said.
The UN agency has called for Israel to allow the entry of more winter supplies into Gaza.
“Blankets, mattresses and warm clothes are sitting outside Gaza waiting for approval to get in,” UNRWA said on Tuesday. “More and regular humanitarian assistance must come into Gaza to help people stay warm this winter.”
According to COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza, 1,290 humanitarian aid trucks entered the strip last week. This is well below the average of 500 trucks per day before the war started on October 7, 2023.
Salem Abu Amra is among the civilians who are bearing the brunt of the cold and lacking supplies in Gaza. He says his family is “struggling for survival” in their makeshift tent in Deir Al-Balah.
“We are suffering from the rain, we were flooded,” he said. “I have three children who were freezing cold overnight in the camp from this weather. They need clothes, they need tents, proper tents that we can live in.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/middleeast/last-hospital-north-gaza-israel-raid-intl/index.html,Israel raid empties northern Gaza’s last functioning major hospital of all patients and detains its director,2024-12-30 13:17:09,"Northern Gaza’s last remaining major hospital is now out of service after a raid by Israeli forces severely damaged the building and emptied its wards of patients and doctors.
On Friday, Israeli forces raided the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, putting some 75,000 Palestinians remaining in the north of the enclave at risk, the United Nations said. They also arrested the hospital’s prominent director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, accusing him of being a suspected “Hamas terrorist operative.”
The raid has rendered the hospital “empty” of patients, some of whom are critically ill, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Those in critical condition were transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, “which is itself out of function,” WHO said. Some patients were also transferred to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, WHO added.
The UN said that WHO is planning a mission to the Indonesian Hospital to move the evacuated patients to southern Gaza for continued care.
Mohammed Salha, director of Al Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, which is barely functioning and severely damaged due to recent airstrikes, told CNN Monday that Kamal Adwan Hospital is “totally out of service” and that his own medical facility has very little fuel and is overflowing with patients, despite limited supplies.
“We have one surgeon who is only performing when a case is in a life-threatening situation,” Salha told CNN.
“The health system in the north is completely deteriorated,” he said. “We are working to save what is left.”
Salha said his hospital must wait for approval from the Israeli military to allow the Red Cross to move cases that require specialist treatment from the north of Gaza further south.
The UN Human Rights Office published a report on Tuesday saying, “the conduct of hostilities in Gaza since 7 October has destroyed the healthcare system in Gaza,” and the situation has reached a “catastrophic level” since last year.
The report said that hostilities resulted in the “killing of hundreds of health and medical professionals,” as well as patients and civilians.
“It is essential that there be independent, credible and transparent investigations of these incidents, and full accountability for all violations of international humanitarian and human rights law which have taken place,” the report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said.
The raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital came amid renewed Israeli aerial and ground operations in several parts of northern Gaza, aimed at targeting what the IDF called a resurgent Hamas presence in the area. The onslaught has left streets as carpets of debris, killed entire families, and severely depleted food, water and medical stocks.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) over the weekend said it had detained at least 240 “Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists” around the hospital, alleging the facility was being used as a “Hamas terror stronghold.”
It said Monday that troops had also “operated to identify and eliminate multiple terrorists in the area overnight.”
On Saturday, after detaining the hospital director, Dr Abu Safiya, the Israeli military claimed that the facility was being used by Hamas as a “command and control center.” The military did not provide any evidence to support the claims.
Abu Safiya’s arrest was met with outrage by Palestinians, the UN and rights groups.
Amnesty International on Sunday called him “the voice of Gaza’s decimated health sector,” adding that since the war, “Israel has detained hundreds of Palestinian healthcare workers from Gaza without charge or trial.”
In a statement on X, Amnesty said that “health workers have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment and been held in incommunicado detention” by Israel.
Trickling aid
As Gaza’s northern hospitals are forced out of service, aid is barely reaching the few hundred thousand Palestinians still trapped in the area.
Since October 6 of this year, when Israel’s concentrated operation in the north began, 5,565 truckloads of aid have entered the enclave, according to data from the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Since December 1, Israeli authorities have denied 48 of 52 UN attempts to coordinate humanitarian access to northern Gaza, OCHA said on December 24, adding that the “four approved movements all faced impediments.”
OCHA’s database says that on December 26, 27 truckloads of aid entered Gaza. There are no records of aid into the enclave after December 26, according to the UN database.
Jonathan Whittall, acting head of office at OCHA, said on Monday that his team has been denied entry into northern Gaza more than 140 times.
“We don’t have the ability to provide the level of assistance that is needed to meet the most basic requirements,” Whittall said in a video posted on X.
“The basics of human survival are being destroyed in Gaza,” he said.
However, the IDF said on Saturday that prior to its weekend operation against Kamal Adwan in north Gaza, it evacuated patients and delivered “tens of thousands of liters of fuel, food, and medical supplies.”
According to COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza, one fuel truck went to northern Gaza for the refueling of bakeries, the group said on Monday.
The multiple humanitarian crises in Gaza – food shortages, lack of shelter and medicine – have been compounded by a snap of cold weather. Gaza’s Health Ministry said a 20-day-old newborn died from the cold, the fifth in the last week.
One surgeon in Gaza, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta, said on X that hypothermia, malnutrition and injury represented the triad of death. “In Gaza this means that people will die of hypothermia at higher temperatures, will starve to death much quicker and will succumb to less severe wounds,” he wrote.

The vehicle, belonging to Al-Quds Today Television, was parked outside Al-Awda Hospital when it was hit, according to the hospital. The Gaza-based television channel is affiliated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group.
Ayman Al-Jadi, Faisal Abu Al-Qumsan, Mohammed Al-Lada’a, Ibrahim Al-Sheikh Ali, and Fadi Hassouna were all sleeping in the vehicle when the strike hit, other journalists at the scene said.
Footage of the aftermath seen by CNN shows the vehicle in flames with the words “TV” and “PRESS” in large letters visible on the back doors. Another video seen by CNN shows it completely engulfed by flames.
Al-Quds Today Television condemned the attack and said the five were killed “while performing their journalistic and humanitarian duty.”
The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the strike, and said that a list discovered by its soldiers in Gaza “explicitly identified” four of the men killed as Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) members. The IDF published what it said was a copy of the list, edited to translate the names and details of the men.
“Intelligence from multiple sources confirmed that these individuals were Islamic Jihad operatives posing as journalists. One source was a list of Islamic Jihad operatives discovered by the IDF during operations in the Gaza Strip. This list explicitly identified four of the eliminated individuals as members of the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization,” the IDF said.
The IDF said four of the men had been involved in “combat propaganda,” describing one of them also as a former Islamic Jihad naval operative and another as a PIJ operations operative, and said the fifth was head of security for PIJ in Nuseirat.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a US-based non-profit group, has said at least 141 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since October 7th last year, “making it the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.”
Of those killed, 133 were Palestinians in Gaza, who “face particularly high risks as they try to cover the conflict.”
Earlier this month, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed an Al Jazeera photojournalist, one year to the day after an attack killed one of his colleagues.
Ahmad Al-Louh, 39, and four other people were killed by the strike that targeted an office of the Civil Defense service in central Gaza’s Nuseirat Camp area, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which treated the casualties.
Al Jazeera condemned the attack, saying Al-Louh was “brutally killed” while covering a Civil Defense attempt to rescue a family that had been severely injured in an earlier bombing.
Mohammad Al Sawalhi, a stringer for CNN in Gaza, said Al-Louh was well known among journalists in Gaza and was often embedded with the Civil Defense in his capacity as a journalist, covering rescue missions.
The Israeli military confirmed it targeted the Civil Defense offices in a “precise strike,” claiming the site was being used as a “command-and-control center” by Hamas and alleging that Al-Louh was a “terrorist” who had previously served with Islamic Jihad. The IDF did not provide any proof for its allegations.

Kamal Adwan Hospital is “now empty” after the remaining patients – some of them critically ill – along with caregivers and health workers were transferred to the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, the World Health Organization said.
The facility has come under frequent Israeli fire in recent months and its closure exacerbates a dire humanitarian situation in northern Gaza.
The whereabouts of Kamal Adwan’s director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, and other staff are unclear, friends, family and colleagues say.
“We do not know the fate of Dr. Hussam. He was actually threatened by the army as soon as they arrived at the hospital,” a nurse from Kamal Adwan Hospital, Rawiya Al Batsh, told CNN.
In a statement shared with CNN Sunday, Abu Safiya’s family said: “We do not know the fate of our father, and we urge you to take action by applying media pressure, making appeals, and sharing news reports to help us push for his swift release from captivity.”
Two Palestinian prisoners released this weekend from Israel’s notorious Sde Teiman detention center said they saw Abu Safiya at the prison, and another former detainee said he heard Abu Safiya’s name being read out. CNN cannot independently verify their accounts. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military to confirm whether Abu Safiya is held at the center.
The Israeli military acknowledged Saturday it had detained Dr. Abu Safiya, saying he was “suspected of being a Hamas terrorist operative.”
Local journalist Mohammad Al-Sharif told CNN he was with Abu Safiya up until the doctor was arrested. He said the doctor was “beaten and dragged by his clothes.”
Waleed Al Buddi, a nurse who worked at Kamal Adwan Hospital, told CNN on Saturday that Abu Safiya was allowed to leave after Israeli security forces interrogated him at the Al Fakhoura school next to the hospital. Al Buddi, who was also interrogated and later released, said Abu Safiya refused to leave without the rest of his staff. Later that evening, some of the staff were released, while others including Abu Safiya, were arrested, Al Buddi said.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it raided the area of the hospital and detained at least 240 “Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists,” alleging the facility was being used as a “Hamas terror stronghold.”
“Individuals are being questioned. Those found not to be involved in terrorist activities are released,” the IDF said.
Hamas, in a statement Saturday, called on “the United Nations and all relevant international institutions to urgently intervene.”
“We demand the sending of international observers to these facilities to ascertain the truth of what is happening and to refute the lies and claims of the occupation regarding their use for military purposes,” the statement read.
Israeli forces launched a renewed aerial and ground incursion in several parts of northern Gaza in early October this year, saying they were targeting a resurgent Hamas presence there. The onslaught has razed streets to carpets of debris, killed entire families, and severely depleted food, water and medical stocks.
‘No limit to the beating’
On Friday, Dr. Safiya said in a post on social media that Israeli forces were besieging the facility, “and issuing orders for its evacuation.” Multiple nurses have said staff and patients were then ordered to leave the hospital and gather outside.
Once outside, staff and patients were separated by gender and both men and women were told to remove their clothes, two nurses told CNN. “Those who refused to remove their clothing were beaten,” Shorouq Saleh Al-Rantisi, a nurse working in the laboratory, said on Friday.
After hours of being held, they were forced to move to the nearby Indonesian Hospital, the staff said, a facility the WHO has described as “destroyed and nonfunctional.”
Some patients said they asked to be transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, but were not allowed.
“They told us to sit down. After gathering everyone, they made us strip down to our underwear in the cold,” Abdulrahman Rayan told CNN, adding that a significant number of people were detained and injured patients were beaten.
“There was no limit to the beating. They struck people on the head with hoses. They dragged three people at a time, including an injured person with a cast, and beat them on their heads,” added Rayan. “They spared no one – not the injured, not the elderly, not the children.”
Other patients were allegedly made to walk hours on foot to a school in northern Gaza, alongside medical staff. “They made us strip down to our underwear. It was a tough situation, and they assaulted the wounded and women,” Abu Mahmoud Al-Attawi, an injured patient, told CNN on Friday.
“We were told to gather in the hospital yard. They ordered us to remove our clothes, and after complying, we were taken to a location near the hospital yard,” local journalist Ahmad Al-Sharif recounted, “I was detained from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and lived under extremely harsh conditions. When I asked for water, the army officer insulted and cursed me with unbearable words.”
The IDF said it had helped evacuate staff and patients ahead of the operation, later adding that “an additional 95 patients, caregivers and medical personnel” were taken to the Indonesian Hospital “to maintain and operate essential systems.”
It is often necessary for terror suspects to take off their clothes so that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry. According to IDF guidelines, as soon as possible after the search, their clothing is returned to them or alternative clothing is provided.”
Asked by CNN about the allegations of strip searches and beatings of patients, as well as if they had evidence to the claims against Dr. Abu Safiya, the IDF responded the claims, saying, “The detention of suspects involved in terrorism, their arrest, and the search conducted on their bodies were carried out in accordance with international law.
Video sent by nurse Rawiya Al Batsh from the Indonesian Hospital, seen by CNN, showed upturned furniture and tattered blankets strewn along the dusty corridors. The buzz of Israeli drones can be heard overhead.
CNN has reached to the Israeli military asking for comment on allegations that men and women were forced to strip.
Several staff also reported a large fire breaking out. Al Batsh told CNN that the blaze broke out in the hospital after Israeli strikes on the building, with staff forced to use water from a kidney dialysis machine to fight the flames.
“Unfortunately, this water was mixed with chlorine and other substances, resulting in burns on their hands and faces,” Al Batsh said, adding one patient died in the fire.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN that “there was a small fire in an empty building inside the hospital that is under control,” adding that it is “unaware” of allegations that the fire was caused by IDF gunfire. It added that its troops “are operating in the area of the hospital and not inside of it.”
An audio message from staff at Kamal Adwan said that surgical departments, laboratory, maintenance, and emergency units have been completely burned.
The WHO has previously said that Israeli authorities have repeatedly denied humanitarian access to Kamal Adwan Hospital and just this week said that a request to deploy international emergency medical teams was denied by Israeli authorities, “despite the need for immediate surgical interventions for injured patients.”
Some patients were taken to Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. CNN footage shows patients who had arrived from Kamal Adwan Hospital, including women, children and those with special needs.
In the video, a man with special needs is trying to explain what happened to him, making signs of gunfire and gestures indicating that he has been beaten on his arms and face. He arrived alone and his bare feet are covered in dust.
The patient’s name is Khaled Hazzaa, according to another man stood nearby who says he is Hazzaa’s nephew. The man says they had not seen each other for 82 days until Al Shifa Hospital called him. Hazzaa was being treated at Kamal Adwan Hospital, the man says.
Another woman CNN spoke to at Al Shifa Hospital said she arrived at Kamal Adwan hospital for treatment two days ago after her house was hit in an Israeli strike and her son was killed. During the raid on Friday, Fatmeh Al Najjar also said that men and women were interrogated and then soldiers “took us in military vehicles and left us at Abu Sharekh roundabout. From there, they told us to walk south.”
MedGlobal, the US-based nonprofit Abu Safiya was lead physician in Gaza for, also expressed concern for the doctor and condemned the raid on the hospital.
Dr. Zaher Sahloul, president and co-founder of MedGlobal and a close colleague of Abu Safiya, said on Sunday: “Dr. Abu Safiya has dedicated his life to protecting the health and lives of children in Gaza, providing care under conditions no medical professional should have to endure. His arrest is not only unjust – it is a violation of international humanitarian law, which upholds the protection of medical personnel in conflict zones. We urgently call for the immediate and unconditional release of Dr. Abu Safiya.”
In a Friday statement, the group’s Country Director for Gaza, Rajaa Musleh, said Abu Safiya and his team are the “lifeline of healthcare provision” in northern Gaza.

Israeli forces “are besieging Kamal Adwan Hospital and issuing orders for its evacuation,” hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya said in a post on social media early Friday.
A nurse and a journalist inside the hospital, which is in the enclave’s Beit Lahiya district, said the same. In audio messages CNN has listened to, they said people there had been ordered to leave the hospital and go to the yard of the compound.
The World Health Organization (WHO) raised concern about the hospital on Friday, saying the raid has put the “last major health facility in north Gaza out of service.” It also warned that at least “60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition, including those on ventilators, remain in the hospital.”
Some staff members accused the Israeli military of starting a fire. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has denied any connection to the blaze. “After preliminary examination, no connection was found between IDF activity to the fire,” an IDF spokesperson said on X.
A video shared by nurse Walid Al Budi, who was also inside the hospital, showed a fire burning in its archive department. Heavy gunfire can be heard in the background.
The Israeli military had been “burning all the operating departments in the hospital,” Abu Safiya said in an Instagram post. Abu Safiya said that some staff had been detained and that a large number had been injured.
An audio message from staff at Kamal Adwan said that “surgical departments, laboratory, maintenance, and emergency units have been completely burned, and the fire is now spreading to the buildings.” Ambulances were sent to transport survivors to the Indonesian Hospital, the message added.
In a separate statement, the IDF told CNN that “there was a small fire in an empty building inside the hospital that is under control,” adding that it is “unaware” of allegations that the fire was caused by IDF gunfire. It added that its troops “are operating in the area of the hospital and not inside of it.”
The IDF said earlier that it had begun operations around the hospital based on intelligence “regarding the presence of terrorist infrastructure and operatives” there. “The Kamal Adwan Hospital serves as a Hamas terrorist stronghold in northern Gaza,” the IDF claimed, adding that its troops are conducting “targeted operations in the area.”
“IDF troops facilitated the secure evacuation of civilians, patients, and medical personnel prior to the operation,” it said, “with ambulances for transportation to additional hospitals in the Gaza Strip to ensure continued medical treatment.”
Israeli forces launched a renewed aerial and ground incursion in several parts of northern Gaza in early October this year, saying they were targeting a resurgent Hamas presence there. The two-month onslaught has razed streets to carpets of debris, killed entire families, and severely depleted food, water and medical stocks.
The Israeli military has fired on Kamal Adwan Hospital on a daily basis, and raided the facility at least six times since October 5, Abu Safiya told CNN earlier this month. Four doctors were killed at the hospital after Israeli forces stormed the compound, killing and injuring dozens of people in surrounding areas, eyewitnesses told CNN in early December.
‘Death surrounds us’
Two nurses told CNN that after the IDF told patients and staff to leave the building, Israeli troops rounded them up and separated them by gender – a process that took over two hours.
The IDF told men and women to remove their clothes and headscarves, Shorouq Saleh Al-Rantisi, a nurse working in the laboratory at Kamal Adwan Hospital, said on Friday. “Those who refused to remove their clothing were beaten,” she said. “I didn’t have a phone but those who were refusing to hand over their phones were beaten.”
Al-Rantisi said the IDF returned their belongings, before positioning a military vehicle at either end of the group of Palestinians and forced them to walk towards Shadi Abu Ghazala street in the Beit Lahiya neighborhood.
“(They) ordered us to take off our hijabs and clothes like the men, but we refused,” she told CNN. “The hardest part was the long distance we walked, and their demand that we remove our clothes was the most difficult. They did not respect that we are women; they looked at us and mocked us.”
Another nurse, who remains in Kamal Adwan Hospital, told CNN on Friday that Israeli forces are interrogating staff “one by one” inside a truck outside the hospital.
“All the young men who were at the hospital have been arrested, including my husband,” she told CNN. “They have assaulted the women, ordering them to remove their clothing as well, which we refused to do… Death surrounds us from all sides.”
‘Bodies remain in the street’
The hospital and its surroundings have come under an onslaught of Israeli attacks in recent months, Abu Safiya has said. Late on Thursday, about 50 people, including five medical workers, were killed after Israeli strikes nearby, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza and Abu Safiya.
Among the three hospital workers killed was a paediatrician Dr. Ahmed Samour, who was on duty on Thursday but went to the building opposite the hospital – where he and his family live – when the strike hit, said Abu Safiya.
Two paramedics were killed in a strike near the hospital while on their way there, the director said.
“The number of casualties reported in the media does not align with the information held” by the Israeli military, it said.
Israel says that Hamas operates inside and underneath hospitals, and is using them for military operations, including as command centers, weapons stores and to hide hostages. The Israelis have released footage they say is evidence of those Hamas operations. The videos do not offer definitive proof, and Hamas has denied the claims.
The WHO has previously said that Israeli authorities have repeatedly denied humanitarian access to Kamal Adwan Hospital and just this week said that a request to deploy international emergency medical teams was denied by Israeli authorities, “despite the need for immediate surgical interventions for injured patients.”
Israeli organization Physicians for Human Rights has filed an urgent petition with Israel’s High Court “demanding an immediate cessation of ongoing attacks on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza,” a statement from the organization said on Wednesday.
The “petition presents grave evidence of the catastrophic impact on the hospital and its staff over the past year,” the statement says.
“Evacuating Kamal Adwan Hospital would abandon thousands of residents in northern Gaza without access to medical treatment for the sick and injured. Many of the patients currently receiving care cannot be safely evacuated due to constant gunfire in the vicinity and the military’s restrictions on ambulance operations,” the Israeli human rights organization added.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/26/middleeast/israeli-strikes-yemen-sanaa-houthis-intl/index.html,WHO chief and UN team caught up in Israeli strikes that killed six in Yemen,2024-12-26 00:00:00,"Israeli forces unleashed a series of strikes on the Yemeni capital Sanaa and the western city of Hodeidah on Thursday, killing at least six people and injuring dozens more, the Houthi militant group said in a statement.
An assault on the capital’s airport hit as a “high-level UN delegation,” led by World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was due to fly out of it, a spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement.
“The Secretary-General is gravely concerned about intensified escalation in Yemen and Israel,” the statement added.
One crew member from the UN team was injured, according to Ghebreyesus. The delegation later evacuated to Jordan, the WHO chief said on Friday, adding that his colleague would “receive further medical treatment” there.
On Thursday, the Yemen-based, Iran-backed Houthis vowed to retaliate for the strikes, and hours later Israel’s military said a missile launched from Yemen was “intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory.” No injuries were reported, Israel’s emergency service said.
The Houthis have yet to comment on the intercepted missile.
The strike on Sanaa International Airport killed at least three people and injured 30 others, the Houthi-run al-Masirah television reported. WHO chief Tedros said he and a UN team were about to get on a plane when the airport came under bombardment.
“As we were about to board our flight from Sanaa… the airport came under aerial bombardment. One of our plane’s crew members was injured,” Tedros said in a statement Thursday, adding that he and his team were safe.
“The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge — just a few meters from where we were — and the runway were damaged. We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave.”
The UN statement said the delegation “had just concluded discussions on the humanitarian situation in Yemen and the release of UN and other detained personnel.”
The organization’s Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) said it will temporarily suspend operations at the airport, Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Programme, which manages the air service, said in a post on X.
UNHAS provides passenger and light cargo transport for the humanitarian community to and from areas of crisis.
McCain said the suspension “will negatively impact the humanitarian response at a time of immense and growing needs.”
Further west of Sanaa, at least three people were killed and 10 others injured in the attack on Hodeidah, reported al-Masirah. The strikes hit the ports of Hodeidah and Ras Issa, and a power station in Hodeidah governorate, the Houthis added.
The strikes injured at least 40 people in total, the Houthis said, calling the attack “a brutal aggression” as it vowed revenge.
Hezam al-Asad, a member of the militant group’s political council, threatened Israel in a post in Hebrew on X, saying “Gush Dan is no longer safe.” Gush Dan is a metropolitan area in central Israel that includes Tel Aviv.
The Israeli military said on Thursday it hit “military targets” belonging to the Houthis.
“The targets that were struck by the IDF include military infrastructure used by the Houthi terrorist regime for its military activities in both the Sanaa International Airport and the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
In addition, the IDF said it had struck “military infrastructure” in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports on the western coast.
The Houthis hold large swaths of territory in Yemen, including Sanaa.
Along with Hamas and Hezbollah, they are part of an Iran-led alliance spanning much of the region that has attacked Israel and its allies since the beginning of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 45,300 Palestinians.
The Israeli military has repeatedly struck Yemen since launching its war in Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7 attack.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said strikes on Yemen would not stop “until the mission is complete.” Speaking from Israel’s Air Force Command Center on Thursday, he said “we will persist in severing the terror arm of Iran’s axis of evil until the mission is complete.”
Months-long hostility
The UN delegation was in Yemen to negotiate the release of UN staff detainees and to assess the health and humanitarian situation there. On behalf of WHO, Tedros sent his condolences to the families whose loved ones lost their lives in the attack, the statement read.
“Deepest gratitude to the UNHAS team for their service and swift evacuation from Yemen, where we were on a UN mission to negotiate for the release of detained colleagues,” the WHO chief posted on X. “Attacks on civilians and humanitarians must stop, everywhere.”
The United States and the United Kingdom have previously struck the Houthis after the group disrupted shipping in the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest waterways. The US State Department considers the Houthis a global terrorist organization.
Last week, a projectile fired from Yemen hit Tel Aviv, Israel’s second-largest city, injuring at least 16 people. Days before, Israel intercepted another missile launched by the Houthis, with shrapnel causing extensive damage to a school near Tel Aviv.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/26/middleeast/israel-sara-netanyahu-investigation-allegation-intl-latam/index.html,Sara Netanyahu: Israel’s attorney general orders probe into prime minister’s wife on suspicion of witness harassment,2023-08-17 00:00:00,"Israel’s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara has ordered an investigation into Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after a report alleged that she had harassed opponents.
“An investigation should be opened into suspicions of witness harassment and obstruction of justice regarding the findings of the Uvda show,” which aired on Israel-based Channel 12 television last week, Israel’s attorney general said in a statement on Thursday.
On Thursday, Channel 12 released an investigation alleging that Sara Netanyahu was intimidating a witness in her husband’s criminal trial.
The report also alleges that she had indirectly harassed the attorney general and the deputy state attorney.
CNN has reached out to the prime minister’s office for comment.
Hours before the investigation was ordered, Prime Minister Netanyahu defended his wife in a video speech released by his office on Thursday where he described the Channel 12 report as “biased” and “false propaganda.”
He went on to say: “I would like to see Channel 12 or the other incitement channels conduct an investigation about the left-wing camp. But don’t count on it. It simply won’t happen.”
Israel’s Justice Minister Yariv Levin criticized the attorney general’s order, describing it as “extreme selective enforcement has reared its ugly head once again.”
“While Israeli citizens expect that anyone who threatened the police commissioner or called for defiance will be summoned for questioning, the advisor [AG] and the state attorney are busy opening investigations following gossip on television,” Levin said in a post on X on Thursday.
The far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also criticized Baharav-Miara. “Someone who persecutes government ministers and their families politically cannot continue to serve as the Attorney General - it is a shame that there are still those who bury their heads in the sand and refuse to understand this,” he said in a statement.
Netanyahu’s corruption trial first began in January 2020, making him the first sitting Israeli prime minister to appear in court as a defendant on trial for charges of fraud, breach of trust, and bribery. Netanyahu has repeatedly denied the allegations against him and has pled not guilty, Reuters previously reported.
He faces charges in three separate cases. In Case 1000, he is charged with fraud and breach of trust in connection with allegations that he received gifts like cigars and champagne from overseas businessmen.
In Case 2000, he is also charged with fraud and breach of trust and is accused of seeking favorable coverage in one of Israel’s top newspapers in exchange for limiting the circulation of one of the paper’s main rivals.
In the most serious case, Case 4000, he is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust for allegedly advancing regulatory benefits worth the equivalent of more than $250 million at the time to his friend Shaul Elovitch, who was the controlling shareholder for the telecommunications company Bezeq.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/25/middleeast/israel-gaza-babies-freeze-to-death-winter-intl/index.html,"Four babies die from hypothermia in Gaza, as Israel’s war pushes Palestinians deep into tent camps",2024-12-25 19:16:25,"A newborn baby died from the cold in a tent encampment in Al-Mawasi, in southern Gaza, a health official said Wednesday, highlighting the stark challenges to survival faced by Palestinian children displaced from their homes amid Israel’s ongoing assault on the strip.
Sela Mahmoud Al-Fasih “froze to death from the extreme cold” in Al-Mawasi, Dr. Munir Al-Bursh, the director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, posted on X on Wednesday.
In the past week, at least four infants have died of hypothermia from low temperatures and a lack of access to warmth while living in tents, Dr. Ahmed Al-Farra, the head of pediatrics and obstetrics at Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis, said on Thursday. Among them were a three-day-old and a one-month-old who also died in Al-Mawasi, he said.
Staff in the neonatal ICU see at least five cases of hypothermia per day, added Al-Farra. Reduced breastfeeding and limited availability of infant formula has severely compounded the risk of hypothermia among babies, he told CNN. Meanwhile, health workers are struggling to treat young patients due to shortages of electricity, diesel and other fuel.
“This is one of the disastrous results of this criminal war,” said Al-Farra.
Al-Mawasi, a coastal region west of Rafah, previously designated by Israel as a “humanitarian area,” has repeatedly come under Israeli attacks. Thousands of displaced Palestinians have moved there in search of refuge, living for months in makeshift tents made of cloth and nylon.
CNN footage from a courtyard in Al-Mawasi showed Sela’s small body wrapped in a white shroud, her 31-year-old father, Mahmoud Al-Fasih, holding her. In another shot, a group of young Palestinian men and boys crouch by her grave.
“(Sela) died from the cold,” her mother, Nariman Al-Fasih, told CNN on Wednesday. “I was warming her and holding her. But… (we) didn’t have extra clothes for me to warm this girl.” The video showed the three-week-old baby’s face had turned blue.
Israel’s assault, launched after the Hamas-led October 7 attack, has gutted Gaza’s once-lively neighborhoods, erased entire families, and spawned a humanitarian crisis of starvation, displacement and disease. More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed and 107,000 people injured, the health ministry there reported on Monday.
‘War on children’
Human rights advocates have warned that Palestinian children are bearing the brunt of Israel’s bombardment and siege.
More than 17,600 children have been killed since the war started, Al-Bursh said on Wednesday. One child in Gaza is killed every hour, the chief of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said on Tuesday, citing UN data.
As many as 17,000 children have been left unaccompanied or separated from their parents and caregivers, the International Rescue Committee reported in October. Others struggle to find enough food, water and warmth, as Israel’s siege has drained supplies.
Children are unable to receive adequate care in the medical system, which has been paralyzed by Israel’s attacks, doctors have told CNN. Just 20% of neonatal care units are operational in the Gaza Strip, according to Al-Farra. Premature babies are dying due to lack of medical supplies including ventilators, while doctors are forced to triage cases to save children’s lives, he said.
The UN’s children’s agency, UNICEF, warned that many displaced children in Gaza are wearing little more than the clothes on their backs – after many were forced to flee Israel’s bombardment in summer clothes, earlier this year.
“For over 14 months, children have been at the sharp edge of this nightmare… In Gaza the reality for over a million children is fear, utter deprivation and unimaginable suffering,” Rosalia Bollen, a UNICEF communications specialist, said in a statement on December 20.
“The war on children in Gaza stands as a stark reminder of our collective responsibility. A generation of children is enduring the brutal violation of their rights and the destruction of their futures.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/26/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-year-popularity-intl-cmd/index.html,"Analysis: Accusations of genocide. Charges of corruption. But improbably, Netanyahu had a good year",2024-12-10 00:00:00,"This time last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the doldrums.
“He started very low,” said Nadav Shtrauchler, a political strategist who has worked closely with Netanyahu. “The lowest point that he had.”
Many Israelis accused him of being asleep at the wheel on October 7, the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Some even said he enabled it by funding Hamas.
His political support was dismal – even if the Gaza war let him brush aside calls for an election. Polls suggested support for his Likud Party was down 25% from just three months prior.
On its face, the year that followed was hardly uplifting. It brought tens of thousands of deaths, regional conflict, indictments, and accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide. And yet, Netanyahu ends the year having transformed his standing in Israel.
“I am running a marathon,” he told a Tel Aviv courtroom earlier this month, facing charges – which he denies – of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. “I can run it with 20 kilos on my back, and I can run it with 10 kilos on my back.”
‘Mr Security’ once again
Netanyahu has spent the year managing – and in some cases instigating, his critics allege – an expanding regional conflict, while simultaneously shoring up his domestic political footing.
“2024 was the year in which he began to recover from the very serious losses in the public image,” the polling and political analyst Dahlia Scheindlin said.
Were elections held today, Likud would still lose a few seats, but support is back to pre-October 7 levels. Opposition from the likes of retired general Benny Gantz has slackened. Netanyahu has neutered dissent by firing Yoav Gallant as defense minister and bringing in obsequious politicians whose loyalty and Knesset relationships decrease the risk that the extreme right or ultra-Orthodox parties could collapse the coalition.
While Gaza is still a manacle – stickers with the faces of hostages plaster Israeli streets – regional conflict has lessened its salience. It has also been key to his success, Scheindlin argues. He has returned to form, positioning himself as the only leader willing and able to defend the Jewish people and prevent the creation of a Palestinian state.
For Israelis he is, once again, “Mr Security.”
“The moment Hezbollah got involved,” Scheindlin said, referring to the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, “it became something beyond Netanyahu’s failure or the failure of his government. It became proof that the rest of the world is against us and wants to kill us and nobody understands the Iran ‘octopus threat’ better than Netanyahu. And so he gets the credit for dealing with it as well.”
Even the corruption trial and an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for war crimes are proof, to Netanyahu and his supporters, that it’s him against the “deep state.”
Again and again, he repeats familiar catchphrases that are as hollow as they are comforting: “a Palestinian state is a reward for terrorism” and Israel will achieve “total victory.”
Iran may be a familiar bogeyman, but Shtrauchler argues that the aggressive military campaign played against “orthodox” instincts for Netanyahu, who before October 7 was seen as relatively averse to using adventurous military tactics abroad.
“He knows how to take a situation and adapt to it,” he said. “Politically I don’t think that many would have believed in November or October last year that this would be his status now.”
For a year, Israel kept a low-level conflict in Lebanon, started by Hezbollah in solidarity with Hamas. The Israeli cabinet overruled hawks who wanted an aggressive campaign last fall. At the end of September that changed, and Israel launched a devastating offensive that killed thousands, displaced more than a million, and flattened much of Lebanon’s southern border.
The aggressive strategy led to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar is also now dead. The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria severed Hezbollah’s most important supply line from Iran. The Israel Defense Forces dusted off its Syria plans, and in a few days destroyed Assad’s naval, air and rocket capacity. Israeli commandos occupy the strategic summit of Mount Hermon, in southern Syria.
“A year ago, I said something simple: we would change the face of the Middle East, and we are indeed doing so,” Netanyahu said earlier this month after a phone call with President-elect Donald Trump.
That ally will soon move into the White House. The incoming president has chosen as ambassador to Israel a Christian evangelical who won’t bother with platitudes about a future Palestinian state.
Though pro-Palestine protests have become commonplace in Western capitals, and Western leaders have stiffened their rhetoric, arms deliveries to Israel have continued.
There are stark partisan and age divides when it comes to Western support for Israel. But polling in the United States suggests that views on Israel, the Palestinians and the war have not changed much in the past year – or even since before October 7.
In the US, according to a survey by the Pearson Institute/AP-NORC, 40% of those polled said in November 2023 that Israel had “gone too far” in its war in Gaza. That rose to 50% by January. But by September this year, it was back down to 42%.
Public support for military aid to Israel has barely budged. Sympathy has risen for both Palestinians and Israelis. The number of Americans who say a hostage deal is “extremely” important has decreased slightly, along with the number who say it is “extremely” important to provide aid to the Palestinians. Strong support for a permanent ceasefire is more or less the same as it was a year ago, at 52%.
Death, indictments, and protest
That Netanyahu has recovered as he has is even more surprising given the devastation 2024 has brought.
Ninety-six hostages taken on October 7 remain in Gaza. Many are believed to be dead.
Fewer Israelis think the country is in a “very bad” situation, according to a survey by the Israel Democracy Institute, but still nearly half hold that view.
Israel’s war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands – the majority of whom are women and children, according to the UN.
In the Western world, politicians and protesters alike are criticizing Israel in a way once thought to be impossible.
It is unclear whether Netanyahu can travel to Europe or any of 124 nations that are bound to honor the ICC’s arrest warrant for him and his former defense minister. The ICC prosecutor says that the prime minister has “intentionally and knowingly” deprived Gazans of humanitarian supplies with the aim of starving them, and is responsible for attacks targeted at civilians. Netanyahu accused the court of “moral bankruptcy” and said the charges were aimed at deterring Israel “from exercising our natural right to defend ourselves.”
Ireland, South Africa, and Amnesty International have all leveled genocide accusations at Israel – the refuge for the Jews, the people for whom the Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin coined the term. Israeli lawyers have rejected that claim as “grossly distorted.”
He had already been the first Israeli prime minister to face criminal charges and prison time. In December, he became the first prime minister to defend himself in a courtroom.
The war has been the longest and most expensive in Israel’s history. Tourism is barely existent. Businesses are closing their doors.
And though Netanyahu ends the year much better off than he started it, his future is far from secure.
Israeli politics is as fractured as ever, and he remains a deeply divisive figure. His governing coalition is more stable, but still fragile. Israel’s image internationally may be forever altered. A ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza appears close but remains elusive. Iran is weakened but remains a serious threat.
“If you took it as a movie, we still haven’t seen the last scene,” Shtrauchler said.",['Mick Krever'],en

Khalil Al-Daqran, spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, told CNN that others had been injured in the strike on a house east of Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip.
In a statement to CNN, the Israeli military said the strike targeted an “Islamic Jihad terrorist” operating in a building located in the humanitarian area of Deir al-Balah. The military also asserted that the reported number of casualties does not align with their information.
Elsewhere, the Israeli military said that it had conducted a strike on Hamas operatives who were operating “inside a command and control center in the area of Daraj Tuffah” that it said was once a school in northern Gaza City.
Gaza Civil Defense said Sunday that its teams had retrieved six bodies and a number of injured people from the site, which shelters displaced people.
The IDF also reported ground operations in the Beit Lahia area on the northern edge of Gaza, “during which the troops eliminated numerous terrorists and dismantled terror infrastructure sites both above and below ground.”
Gaza’s health ministry says Kamal Adwan hospital in the north of the Strip has been subject to intense fire since Saturday.
Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan, said Sunday that artillery shells had targeted the buildings near the hospital, and bombs were dropped in its courtyards by drones.
The Israel Defense Forces told CNN it was unaware of any strikes or shelling on the hospital on Saturday. But the director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the reports of strikes around Kamal Adwan – which has come under frequent fire - as “deeply worrisome.”
However, the WHO said that it had been able to supply 5,000 liters of fuel to the hospital as well as blood supplies and had transferred eight patients to another hospital amid “ongoing hostilities and explosions close to the hospital during the mission.”
A UN convoy with nine trucks was able to reach a neighborhood in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza that had been cut off from assistance for over 75 days. The convoy included two trucks of bottled water and seven of wheat flour and canned food, according to the World Food Programme.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate amid sky-high prices for food.
A producer for CNN witnessed long queues for food at an NGO facility in central Gaza on Saturday.
One woman, Yasra Salem Abu Al-Rous, said she was there to secure food for her children, as she could not afford flour and other basics. “If it weren’t for the charity, the situation would be unbearable,” she said.
Another mother, Aya Al-Batoon, said her daughter’s pre-existing sickness had dramatically worsened during the conflict because of a lack of nutrition.
“Before the war, her weight was about 9.5 kilograms; now, it has dropped to 4 kilograms due to the lack of food and water. Even if food is available, it’s too expensive — we can’t afford it for her,” she said. “Every time I look at her, I feel she won’t live much longer.”","['Mohammed al Sawalihi', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Tim Lister', 'Dana Karni']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/20/middleeast/tel-aviv-hit-by-projectile-from-yemen-intl-hnk/index.html,"Tel Aviv hit by missile fired from Yemen, Israel and Houthis say",2024-12-21 00:00:00,"A missile fired from Yemen hit Tel Aviv overnight into Saturday, Israeli authorities said, in a rare instance of a failed interception over the city.
Israel’s military said the projectile landed in Tel Aviv’s southern Jaffa area, adding that attempts to intercept a missile from Yemen failed shortly after sirens sounded in the area. More than a dozen people sustained minor injuries, according to emergency services, but no fatalities were reported.
Israel’s second-largest city, Tel Aviv is the country’s commercial and diplomatic center. Direct hits from projectiles fired at the coastal city are rare, due to Israel’s extensive air defenses.
After the strike, the Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile labeled “Palestine 2” at an Israeli military target in the Jaffa area early on Saturday.
“The missile struck its target accurately and the defenses and interception systems failed to intercept it,” the militant group said in a statement.
At least 16 people sustained minor injuries from glass fragments that broke in nearby buildings, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said.
In addition, 14 victims were treated for slight injuries they sustained seeking shelter, as well as seven panic victims.
Resident Beth Shahai, 69, told the Reuters news agency that she heard sirens but the missile exploded before she had time to flee her home.
“The ballistic missile landed right behind our building, and all the windows blew in on the first, second floor, and the whole area. It was very frightening,” she said.
Since Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza started in October last year, the country has come under fire from missiles and rockets from Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, both Iran-backed militant groups, as well as from Iran itself. Almost all of the projectiles have been intercepted by Israel’s air defenses.
Israel’s besiegement and bombardment of Gaza has led to tens of thousands of deaths and a humanitarian catastrophe, while its attacks on Lebanon have killed about 4,000.
The Houthis have for months targeted ships in the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest waterways, calling the attacks a response to the war in Gaza.
The Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah are all part of an Iran-led alliance spanning much of the region, that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war began last year. They say they won’t stop striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is reached in the Palestinian enclave.
Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel – in which militants killed more than 1,000 people and took hundreds hostage – sparked the more than 14 months of conflict.
On Thursday, the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen, with shrapnel causing extensive damage to a school near Tel Aviv.
In November, shrapnel from an intercepted Hezbollah rocket hit a building in the city.
And in July, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv – the first such strike on the city by the group.","['Lauren Izso', 'Edward Szekeres', 'Kareem El Damanhoury']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/middleeast/hrw-israel-genocide-restricting-water-intl/index.html,Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of genocide by ‘deliberately’ restricting water in Gaza,2024-12-19 06:03:51,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Thursday accused Israel of “acts of genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza by depriving them of adequate water supplies.
The group, in an extensive report, found that between October 2023 and September 2024, Israeli authorities deprived Palestinians of what the World Health Organization (WHO) says is the minimum quantity of water required for survival in prolonged emergency situations. This has contributed to thousands of deaths and the spread of numerous diseases, the report found.
Israel, which has repeatedly denied allegations of genocide and of using hunger as a weapon of war, denied HRW’s latest accusations, with a foreign ministry spokesperson saying the report was “full of lies.”
The Biden administration said Thursday it disagreed with the report’s findings but is “continuing to press” Israel on the issue, according to a State Department spokesperson.
“Specifically when it comes to a determination of something like genocide, the legal standard is just incredibly high, and so the finding in this scenario we just disagree with,” State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said at a press briefing.
Patel added that the US has brought up water access as part of conversations with Israel. “We need to be doing everything we can to ensure that water access is strong, and that everybody who needs water in Gaza is able to get it,” he said.
According to WHO, a person needs between 50 and 100 liters (13 and 26 gallons) of water per day to ensure their “basic needs are met.” In protracted emergency situations, the minimum amount of water can drop to 15 to 20 liters per day for drinking and washing.
For the over 2 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, even this is out of reach, HRW found. Most or all of the water Palestinians in Gaza have access to is not safe to drink.
HRW says Israel’s actions amount to acts of genocide under the Genocide Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). It stresses that the deprivation of water is leading to the slow deaths of Palestinians in Gaza, including newborn babies whose mothers can’t feed them due to malnourishment and dehydration, and who are drinking formula mixed with dirty water.
Israel’s war in Gaza, launched after Hamas’ attack in October 2023, has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians and injured 106,000 more, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
HRW says that the obstruction of water in Gaza is a deliberate act by Israeli authorities, citing Israel’s obstruction of humanitarian aid including supplies relating to water treatment and production, restrictions on the flow of clean water through pipelines from Israel into Gaza, as well as “massive” damage to Gaza’s water infrastructure caused by Israeli strikes.
In January, the World Bank and Ipsos, a market research firm, estimated that nearly 60% of Gaza’s water and sanitation infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed by hostilities. By August, that had risen to 84%.
In July, Israeli soldiers destroyed a critical water reservoir serving Rafah, southern Gaza. The blast was captured in a now deleted video, which was reportedly shared by an Israeli soldier on Instagram and geolocated by CNN.
In a statement on X, Oren Marmorstein, the spokesperson for Israel’s foreign ministry, denied the accusations and said Israel had “facilitated the continuous flow of water and humanitarian aid” into Gaza.
He said Israel had also ensured water infrastructure, including four water pipelines and water pumping and desalination facilities, remain operational.
Col. Abdullah Halabi, the head of Israel’s Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza, said in an interview with CNN: “We (are) facilitating water from the Israeli side via three big pipes to the north of Gaza and to the central and south of Gaza. We don’t have any information that says that there’s a water problem in Gaza.”
Pressed on that claim, he reiterated: “There’s no water problems in Gaza.”
‘Brazen breach of international law’
Israel has previously faced accusations of using water as a weapon of war in Gaza.
Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, said in November 2023 that “every hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases related to the lack of safe drinking water.”
The crisis has fueled diseases in Gaza and caused deaths estimated in the thousands, HRW said. The scale of the devastation caused by a lack of water may likely never be fully understood, the organization warned, due to the decimation of Gaza’s health care system including disease tracking.
Polio, a highly contagious viral disease often caused by insufficient access to safe water and sanitation, is one example of this. WHO testing first discovered the polio virus in samples of sewage taken from overcrowded tents of people displaced by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July. On August 16, the Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed a case of polio in a 10-month-old child – the first case in Gaza in 25 years.
Bacterial infections like diarrhea have become commonplace in the enclave due to the consumption of contaminated water. Describing the impact of being forced to drink from an unclean well, one man told HRW: “I was getting sick, my kids were vomiting and had diarrhea, and I had diarrhea…This was from the moment we started drinking the (dirty) water.”
The HRW report comes as an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal remains elusive, although negotiations appear to have taken a more positive turn in recent days.
In an official statement on Tuesday, Hamas said reaching an agreement was “possible.” A Hamas source also added that talks were “positive and optimistic.” However, the militant group cautioned that hurdles remain.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/middleeast/israel-houthis-yemen-strikes-intl-hnk/index.html,Israeli military strikes Yemen hours after Houthi attack targets Israel,2024-12-19 00:00:00,"Israel’s military launched deadly strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen early Thursday, just hours after the Iran-backed militant group’s latest attack on Israel.
Nine people were killed and three others injured in Israeli airstrikes on a port and oil facility near the capital Sanaa, said Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, in a post on X. Earlier, Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV said the Israeli strikes targeted the Heyzaz and Dhahban power stations near the capital, and the Hodeidah port and Ras Isa oil facility.
Israel’s military said the airstrikes were retaliation for Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israel over the past year, most of which were intercepted.
“Israel’s long hand will reach you as well,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a warning to Houthi leaders following the strikes. “Whoever raises a hand against the State of Israel - his hand will be cut off, whoever harms us - will be harmed sevenfold.”
Tensions between Israel and the Houthis have escalated for months as Israel wages its war on Hamas in Gaza following the Palestinian militant group’s October 7 attacks – with world leaders warning of the potential for a wider Middle East conflict.
Earlier Thursday, sirens were heard in central Israel after the Israeli military intercepted a missile launched from Yemen, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. A school was damaged and no injuries were reported, the IDF said.
The Houthis later claimed they had achieved their goals in twin missile attacks on Israeli military targets in the Tel Aviv area.
The Houthis have attacked Israel, its allies and vital Red Sea shipping lines in rejection of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians. The group, which controls Yemen’s most populous regions, say they won’t stop striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is reached in the Palestinian enclave.
In July, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center – the first such strike on the city by the group.
Israel hit back the next day with deadly airstrikes on a Yemeni port in the first such Israeli strike on Yemen, according to Israeli officials.
In September, the Houthis fired a missile deep into Israel, and earlier this month, they claimed to have fired a drone that hit a building in central Israel. No injuries were reported in either attack.
Israel’s key ally the United States has also struck Houthi targets in Yemen multiple times over the past year, including consecutive nights of strikes in November.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/middleeast/idf-mount-hermon-2025-intl-latam/index.html,"Netanyahu tells Israeli troops to stay in area of Syria’s Mount Hermon until end of 2025, source says",2024-12-17 00:00:00,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the country’s military to remain in the area of Syria’s Mount Hermon until at least the end of 2025, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN on Wednesday.
Israel captured the strategically important mountain, Syria’s highest peak, following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime to a rebel-led coalition earlier this month. Israeli officials including Netanyahu had initially characterized the advance as a temporary security measure.
The source said Netanyahu’s order was intended to keep forces in place long enough for the political-security situation in Syria to stabilize. He is also waiting, the source said, for clarity on whether Syria’s new leaders intend to honor a 1974 agreement that created a buffer zone along the shared border, on which Mount Hermon’s summit sits. Until the takeover, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world.
Syria’s new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, accused Israel of crossing “the lines of engagement” with its actions in Syria. Meanwhile, several Arab states have accused Israel of exploiting instability in Syria to execute a land grab and “occupy more Syrian territories.”
Netanyahu however has doubled down on the security need for control of the area saying that “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities” in the occupied Golan Heights, an area in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon and which Israel captured and later annexed in 1981.
Just this past Sunday, the Israeli government approved a plan by Netanyahu to expand settlements in the Golan Heights, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office, saying that was “out of a desire to double the population” there.
Mount Hermon is a strategic position that overlooks Lebanon, Syria and Israel. It’s also just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also currently in the hands of Israeli troops – put the Syrian capital within artillery range.
The Israeli military has continued its advance beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 km from Damascus, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/middleeast/why-foreign-powers-still-targeting-syria-mime-intl/index.html,The Assad regime has fallen. Why are foreign powers still targeting Syria?,2024-12-18 15:51:47,"Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and his years-long regime have fallen, but the country remains a battleground for an array of actors seeking to secure interests in what may emerge to be a dangerous power vacuum.
As Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) assumes de facto leadership, Syria is still under attack by neighboring countries, and remains a scene of infighting by groups with opposing interests. Some players appear to be seeking to exploit this potential power vacuum, keen to use the post-Assad terrain to expand control or take out foes.
Turkey is seeking to eliminate armed Kurdish militants, Israel has struck the remnants of the Syrian Arab Army’s capabilities and expanded its territorial control, while the United States has ramped up its strikes on ISIS and moved warships to the region.
Here’s what we know about the fighting in Syria.
Turkish interests in the northeast
Turkey has long had vested interests in Syria. Before Assad’s fall, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had repeatedly pledged an imminent ground operation into northern Syria, aiming to empty the area of fighters allied to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a militant group that Turkey and the US deem a terrorist organization, as well as to create a safe zone for refugee return.
After the rebel offensive started almost two weeks ago, fighting between the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Kurdish militants in the northeast erupted.
The Turkish government has long regarded Syrian Kurdish groups as part of or linked to the PKK. However, Kurdish forces served as key US partners in the fight against ISIS and control swathes of land in northeast Syria.
When Assad was successfully ousted by the HTS-led groups, open combat between the Turkish-backed SNA and Kurdish forces escalated over the past weeks.
Fears of a Turkish incursion have also not abated. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal cited unnamed US officials saying Turkey and its militia allies are building up forces near Kobani, a Kurdish majority city in Syria, with fears that a cross-border operation is imminent.
Israeli bombardment
On the same day rebels took over the Syrian capital Damascus, Israel started striking military assets that had belonged to Assad’s regime. In the days that followed, Israel escalated its bombardment, striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy and taking out, the Israeli military claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles.
Israeli officials said that the strikes on Syrian military assets are to prevent them from falling “into the hands of extremists.”
The Israeli government has reveled in the downfall of Assad, a staunch ally of Iran who allowed his country to be used as a resupply route for Hezbollah in Lebanon. But it also fears what could come from radical Islamists governing Syria, which borders Israel in the occupied Golan Heights.
Its military also started advancing on the ground, capturing further territory in Syria. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) now occupies Syria’s highest peak, Mount Hermon, a strategic position that overlooks Lebanon, Syria and Israel. The summit of Mount Hermon lies in a buffer zone that, until the fall of Assad, had separated Israeli and Syrian forces for 50 years.
The IDF continued its advance beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim.
The Syrian rebel leader Mohammad al-Jolani accused Israel of crossing “the lines of engagement” with its actions in Syria, while a group of the country’s neighbors called on Israel to withdraw its forces from all Syrian territories.
US fears of ISIS resurgence
The US has for years maintained a presence in Syria, partnering with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces for anti-ISIS operations in the country. There are some 900 US troops stationed there, mostly in the northeast.
US bases have come under more attacks over the last year as Iran-backed armed groups supportive of Hamas in Gaza target American assets in Syria and Iraq, protesting US backing for Israel. The US has responded with airstrikes.
In the wake of Assad’s downfall, the US was clear that its mission against ISIS would continue. US Central Command (CENTCOM) has continued to strike locations in Syria that it says are known ISIS camps and operatives, fearing the group might take advantage of a potential power vacuum following Assad’s demise.
“CENTCOM, working with allies and partners in the region, will not allow ISIS to reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in Syria,” said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, according to a statement from CENTCOM.
On Monday, CENTCOM said it killed “12 ISIS terrorists” in precision airstrikes, which are meant to prevent the group from seeking “opportunities to reconstitute in central Syria.”
“These recent strikes are in former Regime and Russian controlled areas ensuring pressure is maintained on ISIS,” CENTCOM said in its statement.
An added complication was resurgent fighting between the US-allied SDF and Turkish-backed militants. After Assad was topped, the SDF said it has come under attack by the Turkish-backed groups, some targeting ISIS detention facilities the SDF says it is trying to guard.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Ankara last week, meeting with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan to discuss the situation in Syria – and the risk that renewed conflict in the north could provide an opening for ISIS’ revival.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/middleeast/hamas-optimism-gaza-hostages-ceasefire-deal-intl-latam/index.html,Hamas expresses optimism for Gaza deal even as obstacles remain,2024-12-17 17:32:38,"Hamas has become the latest party to the Gaza hostage and ceasefire negotiations to voice optimism about the prospects of reaching a deal, amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region.
In an official statement on Tuesday, Hamas said reaching an agreement was “possible.” A Hamas source also added that the talks were “positive and optimistic.”
Top US, Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials have all touted progress in the negotiations in recent days. While officials caution that a deal is neither sealed nor guaranteed, the upbeat language and recent diplomatic activity point to significant momentum toward reaching a deal.
The CIA director, Bill Burns, is expected to travel to Qatar this week to participate in further talks on a ceasefire in Gaza, a US official and a second source familiar with the plans told CNN, with Burns expected in Doha as early as Wednesday, according to the second source.
An Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN that a deal was still potentially weeks away.
Hamas also cautioned that hurdles remain, suggesting that Israel was “imposing new conditions” in the negotiations.
“The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas affirms that in light of the serious and positive discussions taking place in Doha today, under the auspices of our Qatari and Egyptian brothers, reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is possible if the occupation stops imposing new conditions,” the organization said in a statement.
Both Israeli and Hamas teams are in the Qatari capital for indirect negotiations. The Israeli delegation includes representatives from the Mossad and Shin Bet security services, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. It is the most intensive period since talks fell apart at the end of August.
The terms of the deal are broadly the same as the proposal put forth by US President Joe Biden earlier this year, according to a diplomatic source familiar with the matter.
The three-phase Biden proposal in late May paired a release of hostages held in Gaza with a “full and complete ceasefire.” The first phase would last six weeks and include the “withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza” and the “release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners,” the US president had said.
“What has changed is that Israeli forces are likely to stay in Gaza temporarily,” when phase one of a deal starts, the diplomatic source said, namely in the strip of land on the Gaza-Egypt border, called the Philadelphi corridor, and in an area bisecting the strip, known as the Netzarim corridor.
Israel’s demand that its troops remain along the Philadelphi corridor – and Hamas’ insistence that they withdraw – was a key reason for the collapse of talks in August.
A US official told CNN that the Doha meetings were at the lower “working” level. “US officials believe that a deal is closer than it has been but caution that there are gaps and sticking points that remain between Israel and Hamas,” the official said.
The optimistic language follows a slew of regional diplomatic activity, including a visit by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to Israel, Egypt and Qatar last week.
“My goal will be to put us in a position to be able to close this deal this month,” Sullivan said last week, speaking after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Brett McGurk, a top Middle East adviser to President Biden, remained in Doha with other US officials working toward a ceasefire in Gaza as US officials believe that a deal is closer than it has been.
McGurk had been traveling in the region with Sullivan and the fact that he stayed is a sign the administration feels positive momentum, but a deal is not expected imminently.
US and Israeli officials have said conditions have ripened for an agreement to be reached in the wake of the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which has further isolated Hamas in its battle against Israel.
Officials also point to the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and other Israeli military achievements as giving the Israeli government the victories it has sought to achieve before reaching a ceasefire deal.
Since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the death toll from Israeli military action in Gaza has risen to almost 45,000, with more than 106,000 people injured, according to the health ministry in the territory.
US President-elect Donald Trump has also impacted talks, nudging Netanyahu toward a deal and threatening that there would be “all hell to pay” if the hostages were not released by the time he took office. His incoming team has also coordinated closely with the Biden administration and made trips to the region to help secure a deal.
US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday there is “cautious optimism tempered by realism” about the possibility of finally achieving a truce in Gaza.
“Based on the remaining issues, we should be able to get to an agreement, we should be able to bridge the disagreements between the two parties,” Miller said, without going into detail about the remaining issues.
“But that is not to say that that we will, because again, there have been times before where we were close and we thought the differences were bridgeable, and ultimately we didn’t get a deal,” he said at a press briefing Tuesday. “As you’ve heard me say before, all the United States can do is push and try to come up with compromises, but we cannot dictate to either side what choice they have to make. They have to make those decisions for themselves.”
The longtime Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin cautioned that “there is no deal until there is a deal.”
“Hamas has been ready since September for a comprehensive deal to end the war, return all the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and even agreed to give up control in Gaza,” said Baskin, who is not directly involved in the talks but remains a keen analyst. “What is brewing now, perhaps, is a major Egyptian-Qatari effort to reach a deal in stages.”
“Public anger against Hamas is erupting throughout Gaza,” he said. “At the same time, Hamas will not agree to release all the hostages if the IDF remains in Gaza, and even if there is a temporary ceasefire, it will not last if Israel intends to prevent the free movement of a million Gazans who want to return to their homes that no longer exist.”
The Israeli prime minister has also vowed that he will not end the war until Hamas is completely defeated in Gaza, raising the prospect of the war resuming once a number of hostages are released in the first phase of the agreement.
Amid the optimism, more destruction
Renewed optimism over the talks comes even as Israeli forces continue to pound northern Gaza in an offensive Israel says is targeting Hamas’ renewed presence in the area.
Israeli attacks killed at least a dozen people in Gaza overnight, health officials in the enclave said on Wednesday.
Ten people were killed and a number of others wounded in Israeli strikes on a home near Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry. The area has been hit repeatedly in the past week.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a strike there on Tuesday had targeted Hamas militants who were planning to attack Israeli forces. Islam Ahmad, an eyewitness who was inside the hospital at the time told CNN the strike hit a residential building housing displaced families.
The destruction around Kamal Adwan has restricted the flow of medical supplies to what is one of only three hospitals still operational in northern Gaza.
The hospital has been “bombarded relentlessly” in recent days, according to its director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya. Attacks on its generators have left it without electricity, its water tank has been destroyed and staff in its intensive care unit – the last functioning one in the area, according to Safiya – have been shot at.
“Anyone who moves in the hospital risks being injured or killed. As of now, there is no electricity, water, or oxygen at all,” he said Tuesday, adding, “It is clear that the whole world either does not see or does not want to see what is happening.”
Of the three minimally operational hospitals left in northern Gaza, Kamal Adwan is the closest to Israeli military activity in Beit Lahiya and the Jabalya Refugee Camp and has been receiving most of the injured from the surrounding fighting.
On Monday, the World Health Organization’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said WHO staff had finally reached the hospital two days earlier after four previous missions were denied access, leaving the hospital without specialized personnel for surgical and maternal care.
The WHO chief said the ongoing hostilities around the hospital had “further damaged the oxygen supply, generators, and broken windows and doors of the patients’ rooms.”
“The conditions in the hospital are simply appalling,” he said.

Khaled Nabhan drew global attention in a widely shared social media video of his moment of grief in November 2023, as he kissed his lifeless granddaughter Reem goodbye – the 3-year-old girl he called “the soul of my soul.”
“I used to kiss her on her cheeks, on her nose and she would giggle,” he told CNN at the time. “I kissed her but she wouldn’t wake up.”
His grandchildren, Reem and 5-year-old Tarek, were killed while they were sleeping in their bed. Their home was brought down by what Nabhan said at the time was a nearby Israeli airstrike in the Al Nuseirat refugee camp in southern Gaza.
Speaking to CNN following the strike, Khaled described his final evening with his grandchildren, breaking down in tears as he recalled how they begged him to take them outside to play. He had refused because of the danger from Israeli airstrikes, he said.
On Monday, Khaled was killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat, central Gaza.
Saed Nabhan, Khaled’s nephew, told CNN on Monday that there was tank shelling in their neighborhood. As he ran towards Al-Awda Hospital, he was shocked to find his uncle among those killed.
Saed said eyewitnesses told him that his uncle “saw injured people and ran to help, but he was instantly killed by another tank shell.”
He added: “What a great man we have lost. We will never have someone like him again.”
In footage shared on social media by local journalists in Gaza, Nabhan’s lifeless body is seen lying on a hospital bed, covered in blood, as weeping crowds huddle around him.
“Oh, Abu Diaa,” people are heard crying, referring to Nabhan by his nickname.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/middleeast/israeli-strike-kills-al-jazeera-photojournalist-intl-latam/index.html,Israeli strike kills Al Jazeera photojournalist on one year anniversary of colleague’s death,2024-12-16 00:16:34,"An Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed an Al Jazeera photojournalist on Sunday – exactly one year to the day after an attack killed one of his colleagues.
Ahmad Al-Louh, 39, and four other people were killed by the strike that targeted an office of the Civil Defense service in central Gaza’s Nuseirat Camp area, according to Al Awda Hospital, which treated the casualties.
Al Jazeera has condemned the attack, saying Al-Louh was “brutally killed” while covering the service’s attempt to rescue a family that had been severely injured in an earlier bombing.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had targeted the Civil Defense offices in a “precise strike,” claiming the site was being used as a “command-and-control center” by Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who were planning an “imminent terror attack against IDF troops.”
It said Al-Louh was among those killed in the strike and alleged he was a “terrorist” who had previously served with Islamic Jihad. The IDF did not provide any proof for their allegations.
In late July, an IDF strike killed Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul, who it accused of being a Hamas member – an allegation the network slammed as “baseless.”
CNN has reached out to Al Jazeera about the IDF’s allegations about Al-Louh.
CNN footage shows ambulances taking the casualties to the hospital. Some of them are still wearing civil defense vests. It shows one motionless body being carried on a blanket being used as a makeshift stretcher. It also shows Al-Louh’s body on the floor, press vest draped over him, as people surround him. His brother Sajed leans over Al-Louh crying, “Hamada! Oh God,” addressing his deceased brother by nickname.
According to the hospital, the other people killed in the strike were three Civil Defense workers and one civilian.
A spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense strongly denied the IDF’s claim of a terrorist presence at the site.
“These teams work around the clock to rescue people. Everyone knows that the Civil Defense organization is a humanitarian body that provides services during both peace and war to civilians and has no political involvement. The team was directly targeted,” said Zaki Imad Eddine.
This ‘follows a pattern’: Al Jazeera
Al Jazeera, which has in the past accused Israel of systematically targeting its journalists – a charge Israel denies, described Al-Louh’s killing as a crime and said it followed a pattern of attacks in which its workers had been killed or injured by Israeli attacks.
It noted that Al-Louh’s death coincided with the first anniversary of the killing of one of its cameramen, Samer Abu Daqqa, who died on December 15, 2023, after sustaining injuries in an Israeli attack on southern Gaza.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Abu Daqqa was the first Al Jazeera journalist to have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war since the October 7 terror attack of 2023. Since then, a string of other journalists with the network have been killed or injured in Gaza, in disputed circumstances.
On Sunday, Al Jazeera extended its condolences to Al-Louh’s wife and family, adding that just days earlier an Israeli strike had destroyed his house in the Da’wa neighborhood of Nuseirat Camp.
The network also said it was committed to pursuing “all legal measures to prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes against journalists” and urged international legal institutions to take “urgent measures” to hold the Israeli authorities to account and “to put an end to the targeting and killing of journalists.”
Israel’s military has in the past said it “takes all operationally feasible measures to protect both civilians and journalists” and that it “has never and will never deliberately target journalists.”
The Committee to Protect Journalists says the Israel-Gaza war has killed more journalists in a year than any other conflict the group has documented. At least 137 journalists have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, according to the CPJ, making it the deadliest period for journalists since it began collecting data in 1992. Of those killed, 129 were Palestinian. According to Gaza’s government media office, at least 196 journalists have been killed.
Mohammad Al Sawalhi, a stringer for CNN in Gaza, said Al-Louh was well-known among journalists in Gaza and was often embedded with the Civil Defense in his capacity as a journalist, covering rescue missions.
“He was a very fun person to be with, he always tried to help everyone and bring joy to everyone’s face,” Al Sawalhi said.
“He had a great relationship with all journalists, helping them all because he knew central Gaza very well.”
Dozens killed across Gaza
Al-Louh was just one of dozens of people killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday.
At least 15 people were killed early Sunday when an Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering displaced people in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza, according to the Civil Defense.
Eyewitnesses reported 10 to 15 charred bodies after fires caused by “intensive Israeli bombing” at the Khalil Awida school, which was sheltering about 1,500 displaced people, the Civil Defense said.
The IDF said it had carried out a “targeted raid on a terrorist meeting point in the Beit Hanoun area.”
In Deir al Balah, a strike on tents killed four people and a strike on a family home east of Gaza city killed six, according to the Civil Defense.
Meanwhile in the south, Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said 12 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a UN school compound.
The Israeli military said it carried out the strike, claiming there was a Hamas “command and control center embedded” within the compound.
Videos of the aftermath seen by CNN show chaotic scenes as people search through the destruction, with a fire still burning. A man is sitting on the floor, screaming and wailing over what appear to be covered bodies, some quite small.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-call-gaza-syria-intl-latam/index.html,"Netanyahu says he spoke with Trump about need for ‘victory,’ as Israeli government approves plan for Golan expansion",2024-12-15 19:59:36,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that he had a “very warm” phone call with US President-elect Donald Trump, during which they spoke about the need for Israel’s victory in its war on Hamas in Gaza and its stance on Syria.
In a video statement, Israel’s leader said he discussed a range of issues with Trump during the call on Saturday evening, including Israel’s commitment to preventing Lebanon-based Hezbollah from rearming and Israel’s conflict with Hamas, which has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians in the besieged Gaza strip.
The leaders also spoke of the need to bring home the remaining hostages in Gaza, Netanyahu said.
“I discussed all of this again last night with my friend, US President-elect Donald Trump,” Netanyahu said.
“It was a very friendly, very warm and very important conversation. We spoke about the need to complete Israel’s victory, and we also spoke at length about the efforts we are making to free our hostages.”
Hamas and other groups are believed to still be holding 100 hostages in Gaza, including seven Americans. All but four of the hostages were captured during Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
Netanyahu said that Israel continues to “work tirelessly to bring our hostages home, both the living and the dead. And I add, the less we talk about it, the better, and so with God’s help, we will succeed.”
CNN has reached out to the Trump transition team for comment.
‘No interest in confronting’ Syria
Regarding Syria, where a rebel coalition overthrew the regime of President Bashar al-Assad last weekend following a lightning advance through the country, Netanyahu said that Israel had “no interest in a conflict” the country, but would adjust its policy according to the “emerging reality on the ground.”
His latest comments come after Israeli forces following Assad’s fall took control of a long-standing buffer zone that had separated Israeli and Syrian forces for decades – a move the rebels now in charge of Syria and some of the country’s neighbors have criticized.
Israeli officials have said the measure is temporary and Netanyahu has previously insisted Israel has “no intention” of intervening in Syria’s internal affairs.
However, in his statement Sunday, the Israeli leader noted that Syria had “allowed Iran to arm Hezbollah through its territory” and said Israel was committed to preventing the militant group from rearming.
“This is an ongoing test for Israel, we must meet it – and we will meet it. I say to Hezbollah and Iran in no uncertain terms – to prevent you from harming us, we will continue to act against you as much as necessary, in every arena and at any time,” he said.
Israel reached a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah in November after a 13-month conflict largely fought along Israel’s border with Lebanon which saw Israel kill a string of high-ranking Hezbollah commanders. Continuing tit-for-tat strikes have put strain on the deal.
Plan to expand Golan settlements
Israel’s control of the buffer zone has added to tensions with Syria over its decades-long presence in the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that Israel has occupied since a war in 1967. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981.
Since the fall of Assad last week, the Israeli military has also taken control of Mount Hermon, which abuts the Golan Heights and lies within the buffer zone that had previously separated the two sides’ troops.
Despite Israel’s insistence the move is temporary, several Arab states have accused Israel of exploiting instability in Syria to execute a land grab, while the rebel coalition now in charge of Syria has accused it of “crossing the lines of engagement.”
Adding to those tensions, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a plan by Netanyahu to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.
“In light of the war and the new front against Syria, and out of a desire to double the population of the Golan Heights, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today submitted for government approval the first amendment to the plan to encourage demographic growth in the Golan Heights and Katzrin Heights,” the statement said. Katzrin is an Israeli settlement in the Golan.
The plan “will assist the Golan Regional Council in absorbing the new residents who will arrive,” the statement added.
“Strengthening the Golan Heights is strengthening the state of Israel, and it is especially important at this time. We will continue to hold on to it, make it flourish, and settle it,” Netanyahu said, according to the statement.
The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration in 2019. Israel does not view its presence in the Golan as settlements.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar condemned the plan to expand the Golan settlement. Qatar said it considered the expansion plan a “blatant violation of international law” and a new aggression on Syrian territories; Saudi Arabia said the move would derail Syria’s chances of restoring security and stability.","['Eugenia Yosef', 'Sophie Tanno', 'Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Michael Rios']",en

“The actions and antisemitic rhetoric used by Ireland against Israel are rooted in the delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, along with double standards. Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel,” Sa’ar said, according to a foreign ministry statement.
“Israel will invest its resources in advancing bilateral relations with countries worldwide according to priorities that also take into account the attitudes and actions of these states toward Israel,” he added.
The statement pointed to action taken by the Irish government, including Ireland’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state, and its support for South Africa’s legal action against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, criticized the move in a post on X, calling it a “victory for anti-Semitism and anti-Israel organizations.”
“The way to deal with criticism is not to run away, but to stay and fight!”
His comments sparked backlash from Sa’ar, who on his own X account wrote: “Shame on you, Yair!… This is clear anti-Semitism based on delegitimization, dehumanization and double standards towards the Jewish state.”
Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris described Israel’s decision as “deeply regrettable.”
“I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-International law,” he wrote on X.
Ireland announced in May that it would formally recognize the State of Palestine. “There is never a wrong time to do the right thing,” Prime Minister Harris told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour at the time. In response, Israel ordered the immediate recall of its ambassador to Ireland.
Dublin in March said it would intervene in a genocide case against Israel at the ICJ, reflecting the country’s long-standing position of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
The case was first brought to the ICJ by South Africa, and in an initial ruling in January, the court ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power” to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of accusing it of genocide.",['Sophie Tanno'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/world/israel-syria-golan-mount-hermon-intl/index.html,Why Israel captured Syria’s tallest mountain just hours after Assad fell,2024-12-13 00:00:00,"Israel wasted no time after Bashar al-Assad’s fall to bomb all the Syrian military assets it wanted to keep out of the rebels’ hands – striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy, and taking out, it claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles.
But it is Israel’s capture of Syria’s highest peak, the Mount Hermon summit, that may prove among the most lasting prizes – though officials have insisted that its occupation is temporary.
“This is the highest place in the region, looking upon Lebanon, upon Syria, Israel,” said Efraim Inbar, director of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS). “It’s strategically extremely important. There is no substitute for mountains.”
The summit of Mount Hermon lies in Syria, in a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for fifty years until last weekend, when Israeli troops took control of it. Until Sunday, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world.
Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, on Friday ordered the military to prepare for the harsh conditions of winter deployment. “Due to developments in Syria, it is of immense security importance to maintain our control over the summit of Mount Hermon,” he said in a statement.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has advanced beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. An Israeli military spokesperson this week denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus.
Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon, in the 1967 war and has occupied it since. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration.
Israel has for decades held some lower slopes of Mount Hermon, and even operates a ski resort there, but the peak remained in Syria proper.
“We have no intention to intervene in Syria’s internal affairs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video days after Israel bombed hundreds of Syrian targets and seized the demilitarized buffer zone. “But we certainly intend to do everything necessary to take care of our security.”
Mount Hermon’s summit is a tremendous asset under Israel’s control. At 9,232 feet (2,814 meters), it is higher than any point in Syria or Israel, and second to only one peak in Lebanon.
“People sometimes say in the age of missiles, land is not important – it’s simply untrue,” Inbar said.
In an academic paper published in 2011, he wrote of the many advantages presented by Mount Hermon.
“It enables the use of electronic surveillance deep into Syrian territory, giving Israel early-warning capacity in case of an impending attack,” he wrote. Advanced technological alternatives like airborne surveillance, he argued, was simply not comparable. “In contrast to an installation on a mountain, these cannot carry heavy equipment such as big antennas, and they can be shot down by anti-air missiles.”
The peak is just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also now in IDF hands – put the Syrian capital within range for artillery cannons.
The Syrian rebel leader Mohammad al-Jolani on Saturday accused Israel of crossing “the lines of engagement” with its actions in Syria, while a group of the country’s neighbors called on Israel to withdraw its forces from all Syrian territories.
After meeting in Aqaba with officials from Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, and the European Commission, Jordan’s Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of trying to exploit a power vacuum in Syria. Safadi warned that the country’s stability was a “pillar of the region’s security” and that if Israel did not respect Syrian sovereignty it risked “an explosion of the situation.
Israel’s Netanyahu, meanwhile, has insisted his “hand is extended” to the new government in Syria. But in the post-October 7 world, he and other national security heavyweights have made clear they are not going to take any chances.
“Mostly, it’s a comfort for us,” retired Brigadier General Israel Ziv said of Israel’s operations in Syria. “We have learned what happened in other countries when you have a terror organization that captures military equipment.”
Netanyahu has also insisted that the occupation is temporary. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7 style attacks,” he said. His criteria for withdrawing, he said, was a Syrian force “that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.”
It is unclear when that may be achieved.
Whether the military withdraws “is a political decision,” Inbar said. “The military would love to stay there.”

Israeli forces dropped bombs from quadcopters and injured at least three medical staff, including one colleague who had been injured at least twice before, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, told CNN on Friday.
“Tonight was one of the most difficult nights,” Abu Safiya said on a voice message, which was punctuated by the sound of bombardment. The area around the hospital has been targeted with intense strikes this week.
The scale and ferocity of the attacks blew off doors and windows on one side of the hospital, said Abu Safiya, adding water tanks “were blown away from the intensity of the explosion.”
“As of now, heavy bombing persists throughout the night, accompanied by ongoing destruction of buildings,” he added.
“It is a catastrophic scene, with airstrikes and artillery shelling occurring with unprecedented intensity and frequency.”
Israeli forces launched an aerial and ground incursion in several parts of northern Gaza in early October, saying they were targeting Hamas’ renewed presence there. The two-month onslaught has razed streets into carpets of debris, killed entire families, and severely depleted food, water and medical stocks. The Israeli military has fired on Kamal Adwan Hospital on a daily basis, and raided the facility at least six times since October 5, Abu Safiya told CNN.
The Israeli military says Hamas uses hospitals for its military operations. Hamas denies using hospitals as cover. CNN cannot independently verify either claim.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military about Abu Safiya’s accusations.
On Friday, COGAT, Israel’s aid agency said that “intense fighting has been taking place in certain areas of the northern Gaza Strip between IDF forces and terrorist organizations operating in the area.”
More than 4,000 Palestinians have been killed or reported missing, Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, said on Tuesday, since October 5. Another 12,000 people have been injured. Emergency crews have previously told CNN that the magnitude of the Israeli assault means they are struggling to access survivors trapped under the rubble of pancaked buildings.
COGAT said the Israeli military had “allowed and facilitated the evacuation of patients, escorts, and staff” from Kamal Adwan Hospital, to other health centers in the northern and southern parts of the strip.
COGAT added that “efforts had been made to facilitate and coordinate the delivery of supplies to the hospital, including food, water, medical equipment, and fuel.”
But humanitarian agencies have warned that barely a trickle of aid has entered neighborhoods and hospitals in northern Gaza. Israel’s sustained aid restrictions have cut off between 65,000 to 75,000 trapped residents from access to food, water, electricity or reliable healthcare, the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) reported on December 12.
On Thursday, the head of the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said Israeli authorities had repeatedly denied humanitarian access to Kamal Adwan Hospital, where at least 96 patients, and health staff, “urgently need support.”
“The World Health Organization was denied three times in the last four days to access the hospital to deliver medical supplies and fuel; transfer critical patients to Al-Shifa Hospital; and deploy an international emergency medical team,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X.
“Hostilities continue. Today a nurse was killed in an attack while he was on the way to Kamal Adwan,” he added. On Thursday, a leading orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Saeed Jouda, was killed on Thursday while traveling near Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, according to the hospital. CNN asked the Israeli military about Jouda’s death.","['Abeer Salman', 'Kareem Khadder', 'Sana Noor Haq']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/middleeast/israel-alleged-spy-cells-iran-intl-cmd/index.html,Israel accuses an ‘unprecedented’ number of Israelis of spying for Iran,2024-12-13 05:01:42,"In the months before Iranian ballistic missiles struck the Nevatim Airbase in October, Iran dispatched spies to film and photograph the site in southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities.
The alleged operatives were neither highly trained nor seemed especially suspicious to the people who knew them in their day-to-day lives. Many of them appeared to struggle financially.
And yet, Israeli authorities allege that the images they captured of the base provided Iran with valuable targeting intelligence.
The Israel Police arrested the suspects in October, a group of seven Israelis living in Haifa, northern Israel, representing one alleged cell.
They are among more than 30 Israelis arrested by Israeli authorities over the past year for allegedly carrying out missions for Iran – with the accusations ranging from photographing military bases to plotting to kill senior Israeli officials.
It is an unprecedented number, according to Israel Police Superintendent Maor Goren, who oversees counterintelligence investigations.
“If we go check the last years – the last decades – we can count on two hands how many people got arrested for this,” Goren said.
It is a sign both that Iran has ramped up its intelligence-gathering efforts in Israel in recent years, and that – after operating for months or, in some cases, years without being detected – Israeli authorities are finally catching on to these under-the-radar activities.
Israeli authorities are still uncovering more alleged Iranian intelligence-gathering efforts. Earlier this week, Israeli police arrested a 33-year-old Israeli citizen from the north who allegedly carried out tasks on behalf of Iran in exchange for thousands of dollars.
The arrests have made waves in Israel in recent months. Beyond the sheer numbers, the majority of those arrested have been Jewish Israelis – a shock in a country where Jewish citizens are imbued with a deep sense of patriotism and national pride.
“I wasn’t surprised – I was shocked. It was like thunder amid clear skies,” said Leonid Gorbachovsky, the next-door neighbor of the accused ringleader of the Haifa cell, Azis Nisanov.
“He didn’t have anything prominent in him, nothing that would make me or anyone from our house suspect that he would be connected to something illegal. He was an ordinary man.”
Gorbachovsky was home when police pried open Nisanov’s door with a metal bar and watched as police turned the apartment inside-out, finding piles of cash, he said.
Like most of the other Israelis arrested on charges of spying for Iran, Nisanov had immigrated to Israel. Combined with financial struggles, intelligence experts say that an immigrant background could make the accused easier targets for Iran’s recruitment efforts.
To Gorbachovsky, who moved to Israel 25 years ago from Belarus, it is unfathomable.
“How can a person come to a foreign country – to Israel – from a different state and hate it?” Gorbachovsky said. “Well, if it was because of money, then this is a rotten person. How can you sell your motherland for money, even if this is big money? This is your state. How can it be?”
The ‘Haifa Seven’
Israeli police allege that Nisanov, an Azerbaijani immigrant, began carrying out tasks for Iran more than two years before his arrest, after being contacted by an Azerbaijani national who was working as a foreign agent for Iran. According to the indictment, the foreign agent tasked Nisanov with photographing military bases.
For two years, Nisanov and six others he recruited photographed dozens of military bases, Iron Dome batteries and other strategic sites across Israel, receiving between $500 and $1,200 per task, according to the indictment. The indictment notes that several of the bases they photographed were later struck in missile attacks by Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah.
While the GPS coordinates of the bases are known to Iran, Israeli authorities say the zoomed-in images Iran received from these Israelis provided additional targeting intelligence.
“We can’t tell for sure if they are directly responsible for the hit, but we can say for sure that they were there before the attack… so you can say it at least helped, if not more,” Goren said.
Israeli police claim Nisanov and the six others knew they were working for Iran. All seven are still awaiting trial on spying charges. They have not yet entered a plea.
Nisanov’s attorney Maher Talhami did not deny that Nisanov photographed Israeli military bases, but told CNN that Nisanov “didn’t know that he was dealing with the Iranians.”
“He needed a lot of money. He owed money to a loan shark, and he had really bad financial problems,” Talhami said. “He never thought that he was doing something that is harming the security of the state of Israel.”
Others arrested by the Israeli police included a couple in the city of Lod in November for allegedly “conducting intelligence gathering missions” on behalf of an Iranian spying network.
A police statement, quoting a senior official in the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, said that these cases “add to a series of thwarted attempts exposed in recent weeks, during which Israeli citizens operated by Iranian intelligence elements were arrested.”
CNN has reached out to the Iranian government for comment on Israel’s allegations but has yet to receive a response.
Alleged assassination plots
While many of the alleged Iranian spies were only tasked with photographing and filming strategic sites, others are accused of plotting to kill senior Israeli officials and other prominent Israelis.
In August, Israeli police arrested 73-year-old Moti Maman, an Israeli from the southern city of Ashkelon, for allegedly plotting to assassinate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar.
Maman was smuggled into Iran twice and met with Iranian intelligence agents who asked him to carry out attacks against Israel, according to his indictment. Authorities allege he received payments to carry out missions on behalf of Iran.
The indictment detailed Maman’s travel history as a businessman who lived for extended periods in Turkey, where he allegedly developed relations with Iranian nationals.
It alleged that Maman agreed, through Turkish middlemen, to meet with a wealthy Iranian businessman known as “Eddy” to discuss business in the Turkish city of Samandag. On two separate occasions in April and May, the businessman was unable to leave Iran due to “legal difficulties,” so Maman was then smuggled into the country through a land crossing in eastern Turkey.
In Iran, Maman allegedly requested an advance payment of $1 million, the indictment said.
According to the indictment, “Eddy” allegedly said the plots would be revenge against the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July, which would prevent the outbreak of all-out war with Israel.
His attorney, Eyal Beserglick, told CNN that Maman traveled to Iran for business purposes only and nothing nefarious.
In another case, Goren, the police superintendent, said police arrested a man who was suspected of plotting to carry out an assassination on Iran’s behalf with a gun and 15 bullets.
Iranian tactics
Iran and Israel have been waging a shadow espionage war for decades, using spies and informants to gather intelligence to carry out attacks against each other.
Israel’s intelligence capabilities inside Iran are understood to be vast and Israeli intelligence has carried out multiple successful assassinations inside Iran.
Following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, that silent war was thrust out in the open, resulting in the first open military attacks carried out between the two countries.
Iran has also arrested several of its citizens over the last year, whom the regime and the Revolutionary Guard Corps accuse of spying for Israel or collaborating with its foreign intelligence agency Mossad, according to Iranian state media.
Israeli officials and intelligence experts say the uptick in Iranian spying activity that has been exposed in Israel reflects broad-based recruitment tactics employed by Iran.
Oded Ailam, the former head of counterterrorism for the Mossad, calls it “the theory of the big numbers.”
“They are not really discouraged by failure,” Ailam said. “And most important, they don’t really care what happens afterwards to their assets… they say to themselves, ‘OK, if we fail, here we go to the next one.’ And they don’t really care about the outcome.”
According to Goren, the police official, Israel’s Shin Bet was primarily responsible for uncovering and infiltrating the alleged Iranian spy rings, through a combination of digital surveillance and undercover operations.
Israeli authorities say while some of the accused spies were recruited through intermediaries, others were approached on social media platforms, including Telegram.
In a series of Telegram messages provided to CNN by Shin Bet, an alleged Iranian operative sends spam-style offers for “interesting and exciting jobs” that pay “a very high salary.”
One message read: “I have various missions in the cities of Israel that not everyone has the ability to do. My missions have rewards from $100 to $100,000.”
Another said: “We just need brave men. Are you brave? For a lot of money?”
CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the messages.
Goren said the Iranian recruiters often began by asking their targets to carry out small “test missions” for easy money, steadily increasing the seriousness of the missions and further compromising their targets. Goren said such a test mission could involve taking a picture of a building or spraying graffiti on a wall.
In one series of messages provided by the Shin Bet, the target was tasked with buying gasoline to set off forest fires.
“They want fast money,” Goren said of the accused spies. “They don’t care about the country, they don’t care about their own people, they just want money.”
‘Easy prey’
Ailam, the former Mossad official, said those who fall into the wide net cast by Iran are often “desperate people from the part of society that is usually neglected and overlooked.” Many of those arrested are also immigrants, who Ailam said may not have “the same affiliation and the same attitude towards Israel” as others.
“They are much more easy prey,” Ailam said.
Vyacheslav “Slava” Gushchin, alleged to be part of the “Haifa Seven,” appeared to fit this profile to a T.
His neighbors said he had immigrated to Israel from Belarus in recent years, had severe financial problems and was frequently drunk. The dentist who worked next door said he was missing most of his teeth and had sought his help for infections. CNN found dozens of discarded cans and bottles of beer in the small patio in front of the apartment he rented.
When he was arrested, neighbors at first thought it stemmed from a fight he had gotten into with an attendant at the nearby convenience store.
None of them suspected he was allegedly spying for Iran. Gushchin’s attorney declined to comment.
“He looked like a miserable low-life,” his neighbor, Riki Yazdi, told CNN, sitting alongside her husband Moshe.
His arrest sent shockwaves through a neighborhood that had sought to help him, giving him food, clothes and even lending him money.
“No one could believe it,” Moshe Yazdi said. “People here that know him – that also brought him food and everything – want to kill him. If he came here again, the neighbors would kill him.”","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Zeena Saifi']",en

The attack in the eastern suburb of Woollahra comes as police search for three suspects over an arson attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne on Friday and follows other antisemitic attacks by vandals in Sydney.
The spate of attacks has prompted authorities to set up a special task force, Operation Avalite, to tackle antisemitism and increase patrols of Jewish sites including schools and synagogues.
Speaking Wednesday alongside the New South Wales Police Commissioner and Jewish community leaders, state Premier Chris Minns said the latest vandalism was “a deliberate attack designed to put fear into the hearts of the people that live in Sydney’s east.”
He said he’d spoken to Israel’s Ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, on Wednesday and assured him that authorities took the matter very seriously.
“I made it very clear to him that we regarded this as a disgusting display of antisemitism, and that the vast, vast majority of people that live in New South Wales are horrified by it and recognize Israel as an ally and friend of Australia,” Minns said.
Maimon also took to social media platform X to condemn the attack. “This rising tide of antisemitism must end now,” he said.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the attack had no place in Australia.
“Australians want to live peacefully side by side and Australians reject this abhorrent criminal behavior,” he told ABC Radio National. “This is not a political act. This does not change anything that is occurring on the ground in the Middle East. This is an attack against their fellow Australians.”
Rising antisemitism
Australia’s Jewish community has reported thousands of antisemitic incidents in the past year, as tensions rise over Israel’s unrelenting offensive in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attack.
More than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage by Hamas fighters on that day, according to Israeli authorities. In the year since, Israel has bombed the coastal strip in pursuit of Hamas and the return of the hostages, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians.
The conflict has spilled onto Australian streets in the form of pro-Palestinian rallies, including at university campuses that mirrored student protests in the United States.
At the same time, the Jewish community has reported a rise in antisemitic incidents that include a previous attack in Woollahra in November when 10 cars were damaged and graffiti was scrawled on nearby buildings. Two men ages 19 and 20 have been charged with multiple offenses.
Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), said the most recent Woollahra attack was “completely predictable” because authorities had failed to adequately respond to previous incidents.
“We’ve seen a progression from increasingly aggressive and hateful street rallies, the burning of flags, slogans daubed on public buildings and graffiti, the intimidation and vilification of individuals, a surge in online hatred to now this,” he told CNN.
“It’s predictable… It moves from the online space and from words to actions, and the fear in the community now is that someone’s going to get killed very soon.”
Ryvchin said the deployment of extra police to Jewish sites is necessary in the circumstances, but the Jewish community does not want “more guards, more fences, higher walls.”
“None of that makes anyone feel safer. It makes people feel more insecure, more vulnerable,” he said.
Ryvchin said a longer-term solution lies in education “to teach people about this form of hatred and what it does to communities and what it does to society and humanity.”
Later Wednesday, Albanese said 8.5 million Australian dollars ($5.4 million) would be spent on redeveloping Sydney Jewish Museum to promote greater understanding of Jewish culture and the contribution of Jewish Australians to the country.",['Hilary Whiteman'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/middleeast/israel-syria-assad-strikes-intl/index.html,Israel strikes Syria 480 times and seizes territory as Netanyahu pledges to change face of the Middle East,2024-12-10 15:18:31,"The collapse of the Assad regime has prompted a punishing military response from Israel, which has launched airstrikes at military targets across Syria and deployed ground troops both into and beyond a demilitarized buffer zone for the first time in 50 years.
The Israeli military on Tuesday said it had carried out about 480 strikes across the country over the past two days, hitting most of Syria’s strategic weapon stockpiles, while Defense Minister Israel Katz said the Israeli navy had destroyed the Syrian fleet overnight, hailing the operation as “a great success.”
Just a day earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had hailed the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime as “a new and dramatic chapter.”
“The collapse of the Syrian regime is a direct result of the severe blows with which we have struck Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran,” he said during a rare press conference Monday. “The axis has not yet disappeared but as I promised – we are changing the face of the Middle East.”
Israeli officials have reveled in the downfall of Assad, a staunch ally of Iran who allowed his country to be used as a resupply route for Hezbollah in Lebanon. But they also fear what could come from radical Islamists governing Syria, which borders Israel in the occupied Golan Heights.
Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told journalists on Monday that Israel was bombing Syrian military facilities housing chemical weapons stocks and long-range missiles to prevent them from falling “into the hands of extremists.”
“With regard to what will be in the future, I’m not a prophet,” he said. “It is important right now to take all necessary steps in the context of the security of Israel.”
A CNN team in Damascus heard loud explosions throughout the early hours on Tuesday, a continuation of strikes that began over the weekend. Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group, said the overnight bombing campaign was “the most violent in Damascus in 15 years.”
Of the 480 strikes carried out by the Israeli Air Force, about 350 were manned aircraft strikes targeting airfields, anti-aircraft batteries, missiles, drones, fighter jets, tanks and weapon production sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyra, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The rest of the strikes were in support of ground operations that targeted weapons depots, military structures, launchers and firing positions.
The IDF also said its ships struck two Syrian naval facilities, where 15 vessels were docked. Dozens of sea-to-sea missiles were said to have been destroyed.
Images captured by AFP photographers showed large scale destruction of military vessels at the Syrian naval port in Latakia and destroyed Syrian military helicopters at the Mezzeh Air Base southwest of Damascus.
Meanwhile, several Arab states have accused Israel of exploiting instability in Syria to execute a land grab.
The Arab League, a grouping of Arab nations, said Israel was “taking advantage of the developments in the internal situation in Syria,” and Egypt said its moves “constitute an exploitation of the state of fluidity and vacuum… to occupy more Syrian territories.”
‘Beyond the buffer zone’
Nadav Shoshani, a spokesperson for the Israeli military, denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus, but acknowledged they were operating in Syria beyond the buffer zone. The Israeli military has insisted that it “is not interfering with the internal events in Syria.”
Katz said in a statement on Monday that Israel was creating a “security zone free of heavy strategic weapons and terrorist infrastructures” in southern Syria, “beyond the buffer zone.”
Voice of the Capital said on Tuesday that Israeli forces had advanced as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital and several kilometers beyond the Syrian side of the buffer zone. CNN could not independently confirm that claim, but the village lies in the Syrian foothills of Mount Hermon, which Israeli forces captured on Sunday. Mount Hermon is a strategic high point that sits on the border between Syria, Lebanon, and the Golan Heights.
Israeli ground forces entered Syrian territory after Netanyahu on Sunday ordered the military to seize that demilitarized “area of separation” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria. That zone was established in 1974, after Israeli forces – responding to a Syrian attack – captured the Golan Heights in 1967. Israel annexed the territory in 1981, but it is still considered to be occupied Syria under international law.
Israeli officials have refused to give details on how far Israeli forces will advance, or how long they will stay there. Danny Dannon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council in a letter on Monday that his country had “deployed temporarily in few points.” He said they were “limited and temporary measures to counter any further threat to its citizens.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/politics/gaza-israel-hamas-ceasefire-biden-trump-backing/index.html,Biden administration races to secure a ceasefire in Gaza with Trump’s backing,2024-12-07 00:00:00,"The Biden White House is working increasingly closely with officials from the incoming administration as it races to try to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal to halt the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas before Donald Trump is inaugurated on January 20, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.
In the wake of the recent ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, talks over a Gaza deal have resumed quickly but quietly, with US officials scarred by a year of faltering efforts that have gone nowhere.
Not only would the Biden White House like to finally reach a ceasefire in its final weeks in office, but Trump’s desire to start his second term with both the Lebanon and Gaza conflicts wrapped up and the hostages held by Hamas released has breathed new life into a framework that collapsed several months ago.
Five sources familiar with the conversations said there has been close coordination, with Trump’s team being kept apprised of the sensitive and painstaking work by Joe Biden’s administration.
The primary efforts are still being guided by Biden’s team and the two officials driving the ceasefire deal, CIA Director Bill Burns and the White House’s Brett McGurk. Their counterpart in the Trump camp is Steve Witkoff, Trump’s recently named Middle East envoy.
Witkoff visited both Israel and Qatar at the end of November, two sources familiar with his travel said. In his meeting with the Qatari prime minister, a principal mediator of the talks, they discussed the war in Gaza and the potential for a ceasefire deal.
In a social media post last week, Trump proclaimed that he wanted the hostages to be released by the time he takes office, warning that otherwise: “There will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity.”
During a bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi, Witkoff echoed his boss, telling Reuters: “Listen to what the president has got to say. It’s not a pretty day if they’re not released.”
Secretary of State Antony Blinken even sought to spin Trump’s bellicose warning, also telling Reuters that the president-elect’s post was “a powerful reflection of the fact that we as Americans are determined to get the hostages back.”
“I think that’s a strong position across parties held by the United States, and we’re going to pursue every avenue we can in the time that we have left to try to get the hostages back and to get a ceasefire,” he added. “And I think the president-elect’s statement reinforces that.”
Biden officials have welcomed Trump’s support
Despite sharp policy differences between Biden and Trump on countless issues, current administration officials have welcomed the president-elect’s support rather than seeing conflict in the work to try to support a hostage deal.
“Both the outgoing and incoming teams are in constant touch, so there will be a smooth transition,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday on CBS, adding that he spent “considerable time” briefing his expected successor, Rep. Mike Waltz, on Syria over the weekend.
Trump has bucked speculation that he might prefer to see the end of the 14-month war on his watch, surprising some who thought that might mean more credit for the 47th president.
“He’s still going to want to take the credit, he’s still going to take the win,” said a source familiar with Trump’s thinking. “But he’s going to get credit for maintaining the ceasefire.”
Witkoff did not respond to a request for comment. CNN has reached out to the Trump transition team.
A year since the last truce in Gaza fell apart, participants in the talks are clear on their efforts but sober about their likelihood of success.
“I’m not going to sit here and describe the intricacies of the negotiations in public, but we very much believe a ceasefire is possible,” said Jon Finer, Biden’s deputy national security adviser, said on CNN on Monday. “It’s a huge priority of this administration to try to achieve one.”
The other principal Middle East adviser Trump has named, Massad Boulos, said recently that the war is “practically over” and that only the question of a hostage deal remains, which should happen “immediately” and not be linked to any “day-after” plans.
“There might be some disagreement on certain Palestinians [to be released in the deal], but apart from that the two camps have agreed on the broad outlines of an agreement,” Boulos told French outlet Le Point.
The flurry of contact and travel by Biden and Trump officials will soon include a trip by Sullivan to Israel this week for talks on a range of issues, including Gaza. He follows James Rubin, a top deputy to Blinken, who visited Jerusalem last week.
Trump officials engaging with Israelis
Key members of Trump’s national security team – and the president-elect himself – have also been engaged with members of the Israeli government, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Incoming national security adviser Waltz recently met in Washington with Netanyahu’s closest aide, Ron Dermer, according to one source familiar with the meeting.
Hamas and other groups are believed to be holding 100 hostages in Gaza – all but four of whom were captured on October 7, 2023. Around half are believed to still be alive, according to people familiar with the intelligence.
The framework again under discussion reflects earlier efforts spearheaded by the Biden administration, Qatar and Egypt, in which a first “humanitarian” phase would see the remaining female, elderly and wounded hostages be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
Turkey is now involved in the discussions since Qatar closed the Hamas political office in Doha and much of the negotiating team decamped to Turkey, according to a diplomat involved in the talks.
A major sticking point in the discussions was Hamas’ insistence there would be no ceasefire without up-front guarantees that Israel would end the war altogether, which Netanyahu has refused to do. Hamas had backed off that requirement before talks fell apart, and it’s unclear where it stands, particularly in the wake of Israel’s killing of the group’s leader, Yahya Sinwar.
A source familiar with the negotiations told CNN that Israel is seeing more flexibility from Hamas and that Qatar is applying more pressure on the Gaza-based militant group as Doha looks to get into Trump’s good graces ahead of his inauguration.
“Indirect negotiations are underway. We can be more optimistic than before – but we are not there yet. I hope we will be there,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Monday.
Trump has named Adam Boehler, who worked in his first administration and who is a college friend of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as his top official for hostage affairs.
A former national security official who worked in the president-elect’s first administration said they expect Boehler to take on a more active role in the Gaza negotiations than the office under Biden, which is called SPEHA.
Ruby Chen, whose son Itay Chen was taken hostage and later confirmed to have been killed on October 7, told CNN he hopes Boehler’s selection “gives him the mandate to succeed in our case.”
“SPEHA can dedicate 100% of their time” to US hostages, Ruby Chen said, noting that the office “has congressional approval to actually have dialect conversations with terrorist organizations.”
“So there might be a place for SPEHA Adam [Boehler] to actually take the lead in having direct conversations with Hamas to discuss the release of the hostages in the new administration,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/08/middleeast/israel-syria-security-implications-golan-intl/index.html,Israel watches Syria with trepidation as 50 years of detente is upended,2024-12-08 12:51:41,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said that the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria was a “direct result” of Israel’s military campaign against Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah.
“This is a historic day in the history of the Middle East,” he said.
But in a sign of the potential danger Israel feels from unknown rulers in Damascus, Netanyahu ordered the military to seize the buffer zone that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from the rest of Syria.
“Together with the Defense Minister, and with full backing from the Cabinet, I directed the IDF yesterday to take control of the buffer zone and the dominant positions near it,” he said while visiting the Golan Heights. “We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border.”
It is the first time Israeli troops would be stationed in the buffer zone since a 1974 agreement establishing the line of control between Israel and Syria, though they have in the past entered the area for brief periods. The buffer zone, a demilitarized area within Syria and administered by its government, was established in 1974 and was patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it in 1981.
Israeli leaders are watching events across the border in Syria with a mix of trepidation and glee, as 50 years of detente were upended in a matter of hours.
“We don’t know much,” said Boaz Shapira, a researcher with the Alma Foundation, a think tank dedicated to issues in northern Israel. “The situation that we were used to in Syria in the past – 50 years with the Assad regime – has changed completely.”
Bashar al-Assad was hardly an ally, but there was an understanding that allowed the countries to coexist. Though Israel occasionally offered treatment to casualties of Syria’s civil war, it maintained official neutrality in the conflict. The Israeli military has also for years targeted supply lines of Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Syria – most notably killing Iranian military commanders in the Iranian consulate in Damascus, in April – but avoided targeting the Assad regime itself.
The rebels’ rapid capture of Damascus means that Israeli leaders will have to evaluate the implications for their own security.
Iran has now lost one of its most important bulwarks in the region. That will be cause for celebration in Israel, which has been fighting Iranian-backed forces in Gaza (Hamas) and Lebanon (Hezbollah) since October last year.
Netanyahu, who declared that the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was a step towards changing “the balance of power in the region for years to come,” will see this as advancing that goal.
Mordechai Kedar, who specialized in Syria affairs during a 25-year career in Israeli military intelligence, said that the events in Syria were a domino effect from Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. “It’s not only Israel – it’s the whole Middle East will celebrate,” he told CNN.
The collapse of the Assad regime is a “severe blow” for Iran, said Amos Yadlin, a former major general in the Israel Defense Forces, who also served as chief of the Military Intelligence Directorate.
“The rebels tearing down posters of (Iranian commander Qasem) Soleimani and Nasrallah from the Iranian embassy in Damascus illustrate the severity of the blow to the axis,” he said. “Rebuilding Hezbollah seems even more difficult with the loss of Syria, which was a logistical rearguard for weapons from Assad, Iran, and Russia.”
On the other hand, no one quite knows – including in Israel – who the rebels are who now control Syria, and how they will implement their power.
The offensive was led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was formerly an al Qaeda affiliate. The US Government still has a $10 million bounty on the head of its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, whose real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.
Kedar said that despite their radical roots, the opening indications were positive. “So far, they are rather rational,” he said. “For example, they are leaving the government to run the country.”
Jolani has called on rebel forces to leave state institutions unharmed. “To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former Prime Minister until they are officially handed over, and it is also forbidden to fire bullets into the air,” he wrote on Telegram.
“Here, they are learning from the mistakes of the American in Iraq. They don’t want to destroy the country. They want the system to work – of course under different rules and different leadership. This is a very rational way to run the country.”
Yadlin said that Jolani had “demonstrated great political sophistication and conquered Syria almost without a fight.”
“In the short term, the rebels are not a threat to Israel,” he said. “When he is required to establish his rule in Syria, he will not get involved with the most powerful military force in the region. Israel needs to shape the rules of the game against Syria in the same aggressive manner in which it does so in Lebanon.”
That view is not universal. Israel’s Minister of Diaspora and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chiklisaid said in a statement that “the bottom line is that most of Syria is now under the control of affiliates of al-Qaeda and Daesh.” He called for the Israeli military to establish full control within the buffer zone that has since 1974 existed between Israeli- and Syrian-controlled territory.
Indeed, Israel’s top priority will be securing its border with Syria. The IDF said the deployment of troops within the Golan buffer zone was made “to ensure the safety of the communities of the Golan Heights and the citizens of Israel.”
Shapira said he doubted Israel would want to provoke the new leaders in Damascus by pushing into Syrian-controlled Golan. “Taking more territory means we have to deal with other players who might not be so happy about it,” he added.
“There are dozens of different militias,” Shapira said. “It’s going to be very challenging for Israel.”
The Israeli military, in its statement about operations in the Golan, said: “The State of Israel does not interfere in in the domestic conflict within Syria.”
Israel’s top security and political leaders have been mostly mum on events in Syria – no doubt, as they evaluate how to react.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid said that Assad’s ouster emphasized the need “to create a strong regional coalition with Saudi Arabia and the Abraham Accords countries (Bahrain, UAE, Morocco, Sudan) in order to jointly address regional instability. The Iranian axis has weakened significantly, and Israel needs to strive for a comprehensive political achievement that will also assist it in Gaza and the West Bank.”

The Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases: one from family members who sued the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the other from the Biden administration, which is siding with those families.
At issue are a series of deadly attacks inside Israel that date to the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. The case is not directly related to – but will take place in the shadow of – the current conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas.
In one of the cases now before the justices, a federal court in 2015 awarded victims more than $650 million under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act, which permits Americans to sue for damages caused by terrorism.
But the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that verdict, ruling that courts lacked jurisdiction over the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority.
The Supreme Court declined to review that decision in 2018, but Congress then enacted a law in 2019 that allowed the plaintiffs to haul the Palestinian groups into court.
As the litigation continued, lower courts ruled that the new law violated the equal protection clause. The Biden administration intervened to defend the law, and the administration appealed to the Supreme Court in August.
The plaintiffs described the 2nd Circuit decision as “more than dangerous” and “flat wrong.”
The Palestinian Authority told the Supreme Court in a briefing that because it does not “maintain any constitutionally meaningful connection to the United States,” allowing federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over claims “for alleged attacks in Israel and Palestine would violate due process.”

The source told CNN Herzog had made the call at the request of hostage family members who hope Musk will be able to apply pressure on all parties to secure a deal.
The communication comes after President-elect Donald Trump, to whom Musk has closely allied himself, said Monday that there would be “ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East” if the hostages being held in Gaza aren’t released before he is sworn in as president on January 20.
A source close to the hostage families, who spoke with President Herzog and who is familiar with the conversation, told CNN: “There was a chat between the President and a few hostage families, where one of the subjects discussed was influence on Trump, and Elon Musk’s name came up as someone of influence on Trump. Therefore, keeping an open channel with him is important.”
It is believed there are 100 hostages, both dead and alive, currently being held in Gaza, 96 of whom were taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel last year.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the families of those captured to secure their release, but repeated efforts to strike a ceasefire-for-hostages agreement have fallen short.
Last November, Musk travelled to Israel to meet leaders and the relatives of hostages, as part of his efforts to walk back an antisemitic tweet in which he agreed with a user that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”

JPMorgan Chase pulled out of Twitch advertising in the last couple of months, a source said, though it was part of a broader strategy of brand safety and worries about what content was showing up near their ads. Antisemitism allegations went into those considerations.
Chevron, a sponsor of Twitch’s semi-annual convention, TwitchCon, expressed disappointment with Twitch in a statement to CNN after controversial comments were made during a TwitchCon panel of Middle Eastern streamers.
At least two other companies, AT&T and Dunkin’ Donuts, also pulled out of advertising on the platform, according to Bloomberg. Twitch told CNN it does not comment on advertisers.
The controversy at Twitch underscores how hard it is to deal with sensitive political topics that have become commonly discussed and shared on social media.
“There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote in a November blog post, adding that Twitch works “hard to ensure that our community is a safe place.”
Hasan Piker, who goes by HasanAbi to his 2.8 million Twitch subscribers, has been described as the left’s Joe Rogan.
Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York wrote a letter to Twitch last month “concerning antisemitic and anti-American propaganda emanating from Hasan Piker, one of Twitch’s largest online streamers.”
In the letter, Torres wrote: “Mr. Piker has demonized Orthodox Jews as ‘inbred’ and has dehumanized a Jewish man as a ‘bloodthirsty pig dog.’” Piker told NBC News last month that the videos cited in the letter were taken out of context and he was criticizing the Israeli government, not Jewish people.
“I’ve been an outspoken advocate for Palestinian emancipation for the past 10 years, professionally in my media career,” he said in an interview with Wired in August. When asked about antisemitic allegations in an interview with CNN, he said: “Of course not. The real problem here is that I’m anti-Zionist. The real problem here is that I’m extremely critical of Israel.”
A campaign to pressure advertisers to pull out of Twitch was led by supporters of Dan “DanCantStream” Saltman and people in spaces linked to Steven “Destiny” Bonnell. Saltman has criticized and targeted Piker, and Saltman told DigiDay his campaign’s group had reached out to over 100 advertisers already.
In a response to a Bloomberg journalist’s questions, he said “The goal of our campaign is simple: The CEO, Dan Clancy stepping down.” He also said “My ban from Twitch was ceremonial at best – I was in the process of deleting my account when the ban went into place.”
Both have been suspended from Twitch for different reasons; Saltman for harassment rules and Destiny for hateful conduct. Many of their fans online on forums such as Reddit want them reinstated.
Saltman claims his ban was likely to prevent him from speaking to other streamers about issues on the platform.
“When a major media company such as Twitch encourages, promotes and protects virulent antisemitism on its platform, it’s prudent for advertisers to be aware of what spaces they are supporting,” Saltman said in the letter.
However, critics allege the some of those campaigning against antisemitism are not acting in good faith.
Critics have accused Saltman, Destiny and their supporters or those associated with them of targeting and harassing female journalists and Twitch employees, actions that violate Twitch’s policy.
Controversy over streamers
Comments made at the “Ayyrabs Podcast” panel, hosted by Twitch partner and streamer Frogan at TwitchCon, are at the center of the controversy. The in-person event is dedicated to the platform, its creators and users and took place in September.
Twitch suspended those panelists, as well as separately an account for user Asmongold, after he made racist remarks about Palestinians. It was not specified to CNN how long each suspension was.
At the panel, when the panelists were ranking how “Arab” other streamers were, the lowest category on the board was “Loves Sabra.” Sabra, a hummus brand that was previously partially owned by Israeli food company The Strauss Group, was fully acquired by PepsiCo in November. Sabra is often part of pro-Palestinian boycotts.
The background of the panel featured logos from Chevron, Samsung and Capcom.
In a statement to CNN, Chevron said the “derogatory comments” made on stage were “deeply hurtful” and expressed disappointment in Twitch organizers.
“As an event sponsor, Chevron relied on conference organizers to exercise stringent oversight of presentations and content, and we are disappointed that such divisive rhetoric was allowed onstage,” a spokesperson said Wednesday. The company said it reviews its sponsorships and advertisements “periodically.”
In October, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a pro-Israel and Jewish advocacy group that works to combat anti-Semitism, said it spoke with Twitch staff a month after TwitchCon.
“Twitch must learn from this situation and improve how they address antisemitism and hate on their platform, which is an ongoing and significant challenge,” the ADL said in a statement on X. The ADL said it was not in touch with any advertisers.
One online commentator, Ethan Klein, who was featured on the board as someone who “Loves Sabra,” posted in a video alleging that the messaging of the panel was “kinda Arab good, Jew bad.”
On X, Frogan said she was banned from Twitch for 30 days, posting a screengrab citing “targeted hateful conduct.”
She also said the “habibi pass” list was a “meme tier list,” essentially equating it to an online joke in a format that’s popular online. (“Habibi” is Arabic for beloved; a “habibi pass” means someone who can use the word in line with its meaning.)
“The whole basis of my podcast ayyrabs with capri and raff is that we are all arabs from different religious backgrounds - i am muslim, capri is christian, and raff is jewish,” she said, referring to the suspended hosts of the podcast who were also part of the panel.
In October, Frogan posted that her suspension was longer than user Asmongold, whose real name is Zack Hoyt. His main channel on Twitch is popular with 3.6 million followers. While Frogan’s comments, which were made with sponsors clearly displayed in the backdrop behind her, caused a 30 day ban, she said Hoyt’s tirade against Palestinians got two weeks. Twitch did not confirm the lengths of the suspensions.
Earlier this year, he called the victims of Israel’s military campaign, who number at least 44,502 according to the local health ministry, “terrible people” adding that they come from an “inferior culture.”
“If you want to consider it genocide as a systematic killing of a group of people, they have genocide built into Sharia law right now,” Asmongold said in the viral clip. “So no, I’m not going to cry a f**king river when people who have genocide that’s baked into their laws are getting genocided. I don’t give a f**k. They’re terrible people. It’s not even a question. It’s crazy that people don’t see it that way. They’d be doing the same thing.”
Asmongold later posted an apology on X in October, saying “Looking back on it, I was way too much of an a**hole about the Palestine thing. My bad.” In a follow-up video on YouTube, he said he “deserved” the repercussions and called his comments “disgusting.”
Updating its policy
Twitch said it enforces its policies evenly.
“Any and all content on Twitch must abide by our Community Guidelines, and we apply these rules objectively, to all of our creators. When we find content that breaks those rules, we take enforcement action,” the company said in a statement Wednesday.
In November, Twitch updated its hateful content policy to include the term “Zionist” when using it “to attack or demean another individual or group of people on the basis of their background or religious belief.”
The company acknowledged that Zionism refers to a political movement, and using the term in that context, whether in support or not, does not violate the policy.
That same month, Twitch also requested streamers to use a new label, “Politics and Sensitive Social Issues,” on topics relating to those issues. Those labels help users choose what they want to consume on the site, and also for brands to have more control over where their ads appear, Twitch said.",['Ramishah Maruf'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/04/world/amnesty-international-israel-genocide-gaza-intl/index.html,Amnesty International says there is ‘sufficient evidence’ to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza,2024-12-05 00:01:42,"Amnesty International on Wednesday said that it had gathered “sufficient evidence to believe” that Israel’s conduct during the war in Gaza amounts to genocide against the Palestinian people – a charge the Israeli government has vehemently denied.
The 296-page report details evidence gathered over nine months, outlining numerous instances in which Amnesty says Israeli forces and government authorities have committed three of five acts prohibited under the United Nations’ Genocide Convention – including the mass killing of Palestinian civilians, causing serious bodily or mental harm, and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life “calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.”
“Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,” Amnesty International Secretary General Agnès Callamard said in a statement.
Amnesty said that Israel is responsible for extensive and often indiscriminate aerial and ground attacks, widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure, the forced mass displacement of Palestinians across the besieged enclave, and the obstruction of humanitarian aid.
“There is only one reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence presented: genocidal intent has been part and parcel of Israel’s conduct in Gaza since 7 October 2023, including its military campaign,” Amnesty’s report states.
Israel launched the war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants carried out an attack on southern Israel on October 7 last year, killing 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage. In a little over a year, more than 44,000 people in Gaza have been killed and 104,000 injured as a result of Israel’s ongoing military onslaught, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Israel’s military called Amnesty’s report “entirely baseless” and said it failed to account for the operational realities faced by Israeli soldiers within Gaza.
“The report’s allegations of genocide and intentional harm are not only unfounded but also ignore Hamas’ violations of international law, including its use of civilians as human shields and its deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that the military tries to mitigate harm to civilians.
While Amnesty says that it recognizes that Hamas has put Palestinian civilians in danger by operating from, or in the vicinity of, densely populated residential areas, the organization asserts that this does did not relieve Israel from its own obligations under international humanitarian law to spare civilians and avoid indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks.
Israeli government lawyers, speaking earlier this year at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, rejected what they called “grossly distorted” accusations of genocide leveled against it by South Africa. The lawyers argued that the convention was adopted only to “address a malevolent crime of the most exceptional circumstances,” and was “not designed to address the brutal impact of intensive hostilities” on civilians during warfare. It called South Africa’s accusation “a concerted and cynical effort to pervert the meaning of the term ‘genocide’ itself.”
The report is the latest in a string of accusations over Israel’s conduct in Gaza. Over the weekend, former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’lon – who served for three decades with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) – described the Israeli military’s actions in northern Gaza as “ethnic cleansing.” A United Nations Special Committee warned in November that Israel’s conduct in Gaza was “consistent with the characteristics of genocide.” And Human Rights Watch said last month that the forced mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza amounted to a war crime and a crime against humanity. The military rejected those accusations and said its forces act within international law.
Amnesty’s Israel office issued a dissent, saying that it did not believe the “genocide” threshold had been reached.
“Many of us have doubts regarding the possibility of proving unequivocally, and beyond any reasonable alternative explanation, the element of intent,” the organization said in a statement, though it acknowledged that that was not a universal view among its staffers. It did say that there was “no dispute within the Israeli section” that Israel’s conduct in Gaza raises “suspicions of widespread violations of international law and may amount to crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.”
What constitutes a violation of the UN Genocide Convention?
The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which Israel ratified in 1950, says that genocide has occurred when any of five prohibited acts are are carried out with the intent “to destroy in whole, or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.”
The organization said it believes Israel’s acts were committed with the specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza. As evidence for that, it cited calls by Israeli military and government officials for the targeting of Palestinians in Gaza using language that “equated Palestinian civilians with the enemy to be destroyed.” It also noted the use of indiscriminate weapons within densely populated areas, and actions taken by Israeli authorities to obstruct or prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the besieged enclave.
The investigation – which focuses on Israel’s actions between October 7, 2023, and July 2024 – examines the repeated and consistent targeting of residential buildings and civilian infrastructure in densely populated areas, including apartment buildings, religious sites, schools and markets.
Amnesty also noted the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, such as US-manufactured Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), in some cases without warning or between the hours of 11pm and 4am, when residents would likely be sleeping.
“Even where Israeli forces targeted what could be considered military objectives, Israel’s use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, especially aerial bombs of 250 pounds to 2,000 pounds, on residential buildings and in the proximity of hospitals in one of the world’s most densely populated areas likely constitute indiscriminate and/or disproportionate attacks,” Amnesty said.
In a detailed report verifying fatalities in Gaza in the first six months of the conflict, the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it “found close to 70 per cent to be children and women, indicating a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law” on the part of the Israeli military.
It added that of the confirmed deaths, 80% were killed in residential buildings or similar housing, of which 44% were children and 26% were women.
In a series of case studies examined by Amnesty, the human rights organization highlighted a deadly Israeli strike on a residential building in Rafah in December 2023, which killed at least 30 civilians, including 11 children. Among the fatalities was three-month-old Ayla Nasman, who was killed alongside her mother, grandparents, and two siblings – aged just five and four. Ayla’s father, Ahmad, survived the attack. He said it took him four days to retrieve Ayla’s body from the rubble, and that he found his five-year-old daughter, Arwa, had been decapitated by the blast.
“While Amnesty International’s investigation has focused only on a small fraction of Israel’s aerial attacks, they are indicative of a pattern of repeated direct or indiscriminate attacks by the Israeli military in Gaza over the nine-month period under review,” the organization said.
The report also refers to the staggering number of injuries recorded over the course of the war, which Amnesty said meets the UN convention’s criteria of causing serious bodily or mental harm. According to the UN’s World Health Organization, approximately 22,500 people were estimated to have suffered life-changing injuries requiring long-term rehabilitation by late July, with more than 3,000 limb amputations reported. Recent data from the Palestinian Ministry of Health places the total number of injuries recorded at over 100,000.
As the humanitarian situation in Gaza grows more desperate, Amnesty International says Israel has brought the Palestinian population within the enclave “to the brink of collapse,” noting the “disastrous conditions” within the strip, caused by Israel’s destruction of critical infrastructure.
Evidence featured in the report explores the deepening hunger crisis civilians in Gaza are facing, with obstructions to vital humanitarian aid reaching the strip. According to the UN, the number of aid trucks entering Gaza was critically low in November, with the number of food trucks received last month equating to just 36% of the monthly average since 2023.
Amnesty’s report also examines the forced mass displacement of Palestinians in “unsafe and inhumane conditions,” with civilians repeatedly ordered by the Israeli military to evacuate to so-called “humanitarian zones,” which offer little in the way of shelter and have repeatedly been targeted by Israeli airstrikes.
“Israel has forcibly displaced 90% of Gaza’s 2.2 million inhabitants, many of them multiple times, into ever-shrinking, ever-changing pockets of land that lacked basic infrastructure, forcing people to live in conditions that exposed them to a slow and calculated death.”
In a statement on Wednesday, Callamard said the organization’s damning findings “must serve as a wake-up call” to the international community, warning that states who continue to transfer arms to Israel could be at risk of becoming complicit in genocide.
“All states with influence over Israel, particularly key arms suppliers like the USA and Germany, but also other EU member states, the UK and others, must act now to bring Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza to an immediate end,” Callamard said. “This is genocide. It must stop now.”",['Nada Bashir'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/middleeast/israel-nablus-hospital-undercover-raid-intl/index.html,"Undercover Israeli forces raid West Bank hospital, seize alleged militant from ICU",2024-12-05 13:00:32,"Israeli forces dressed in civilian clothes raided a hospital in the northern occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and detained an alleged Palestinian militant who had days earlier been injured in an Israeli airstrike that killed two Hamas members.
“Around 20 undercover Israeli special forces – wearing doctors’, nurses’, and even female Palestinians’ outfits – stormed the hospital,” a hospital official, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak with the media, told CNN. “The entire process took less than six minutes – storming, kidnapping and departure.”
Video from bystanders shows Israeli forces, one of whom wore a white medical coat, wheeling the suspect out of the Nablus hospital in a wheelchair and into an unmarked van.
In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that following an “elimination attempt” of the alleged militant, “security forces precisely operated and apprehended him today” at a hospital in Nablus.
The military said the alleged militant, Ayman Ghanam, took part in an August shooting attack near an Israeli settlement in the northern West Bank, which killed one Israeli civilian and injured another.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says that international law bars perfidy, which includes “feigning civilian or non-combatant status” to kill, injure or capture an adversary.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health called the raid “a flagrant violation of all international laws and conventions that stipulate the protection of treatment centers and patients.” The IDF said the operation was planned to “mitigate harm to patients and the medical staff of the hospital.”
In January, Israeli special forces, dressed as civilians and medical staff, infiltrated the Ibn Sina hospital in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday and killed three Palestinian men.
Ghanam was injured in an Israeli airstrike on a car near the town of Aqaba in the northern West Bank on Tuesday, which the IDF said targeted “a terrorist cell planning an imminent terror attack.”
In the hours after that strike, Israeli forces raided a hospital in Tubas city, handcuffing medical staff and arresting several people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health and videos taken by bystanders. The IDF said soldiers “did not enter the hospital.”
Hamas’ military wing, the Qassam Brigades, said in a statement that Tuesday’s strike killed two of its members “following a treacherous Zionist bombardment that they were subjected” to while carrying out a mission with other fighters near Aqaba.
The hospital official told CNN that Ghanam, who had been “seriously injured,” was in the ICU at the time of the Israeli raid and had undergone surgeries to treat abdominal and leg injuries.
The IDF said that “security forces will continue to operate wherever necessary to thwart terrorism in the area and to maintain the safety of Israeli civilians.”",['Mick Krever'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/04/middleeast/gaza-soup-chef-killed-israel-intl/index.html,"‘They killed him on the spot.’ Israel targeted Gaza soup kitchen chef in drone attack, brother says",2024-12-04 13:40:41,"Mahmoud Almadhoun, 33, walked towards Kamal Adwan Hospital early Saturday to drop off produce to hundreds of patients in the besieged Beit Lahiya neighborhood, in northern Gaza.
But moments later, an Israeli drone struck and killed Mahmoud, according to two relatives – months after he told CNN that surviving more than a year of war is “our greatest victory.”
“They killed him on the spot,” Hani Almadhoun, Mahmoud’s brother, said on Monday. “They’ve targeted him… It is an attack against him. It’s not an accident.”
A friend rushed to take Mahmoud to the medical facility, but was immediately surrounded by gunfire, Hani, who is based in Virginia, alleged to CNN.
“They thought they could save him, but they said the sniper fire started shooting at them or near them,” he added. “They tried to find another route and they couldn’t. So, they just took him home, said a final goodbye, wrapped him in a blanket [and] quickly buried him.”
Over the past year, the Israeli military had detained Mahmoud twice in northern Gaza and released him both times, Hani told CNN. “He was detained unclothed, and they released him,” he said. “They had no interest in them, they let them go.”
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on Hani’s allegations.
The Israeli military campaign in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has eviscerated entire families, turned once-lively neighborhoods into sprawling displacement areas, and triggered a humanitarian crisis of severe hunger, dehydration and disease.
A strike on southern Gaza’s Al Mawasi area, which Israel itself had designated as a humanitarian zone, is one of the latest attacks on areas where displaced Palestinians are sheltering. At least 20 people were killed, including at least 11 children, according to Nasser hospital officials on Wednesday. The Israeli military said efforts were taken to mitigate civilian harm before its “precise strike” on senior Hamas militants in the humanitarian area.
At least 44,502 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health there. Another 105,454 people have been injured, the ministry added.
Hani told CNN that at least 180 of his relatives, including immediate and extended family members, have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza. Last winter, his other brother, Majed, his wife, and their four children, were killed by an Israeli airstrike – just two hours before a temporary ceasefire came into effect.
Mahmoud is survived by his wife, Alaa, and their seven children – the youngest of whom is a baby girl named Aline, who was born just two weeks ago. The family have since fled from Beit Lahiya to another neighborhood in northern Gaza, Hani told CNN.
“There is nobody there to support them,” he said. “[Mahmoud] was their breadwinner, and he was the father.
“He had a soft side to him. He was a jokester. He was always teasing my mom and dad. He just cared for his neighbors.”
‘He refused to leave’
Before the war, Mahmoud owned a store selling mobile devices. But like many other retailers in the enclave, Israel’s bombing campaign destroyed his business. Instead, he turned to running a soup kitchen.
In September, Mahmoud told CNN that he feeds between 600 and 800 families per day in the northern Gaza strip. “Thank God we survived physically,” he said. “That is our greatest victory.”
Then on October 5, Israeli forces unleashed a volley of aerial and ground attacks on three neighborhoods in northern Gaza, decimating entire street blocks, compounding chronic hunger and leaving emergency crews unable to rescue civilians wounded by the onslaught.
The Israeli military says the attacks are targeting Hamas’ renewed presence in the region. More than 3,700 Palestinians have been killed there, according to Gaza’s Government Media Office (GMO). Another 10,000 people have been injured, the GMO said on Monday.
As Israel’s attacks intensified, the soup kitchen’s operations became increasingly precarious, Hani recalled. In the days preceding his death, Mahmoud delivered meals for as many as 200 to 250 families per day. He started sending produce to the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, serving patients and medical staff, according to his cousin based in Gaza.
“In his last effort, he managed to bring in vegetables with the aid supplies and ambulances that had arrived in the north, bringing joy to many during such difficult times,” Yahya Almadhoun told CNN on Monday.
“He refused to leave the north. When we fled the north, we spoke with him and urged him to come with us, but he declined, saying, ‘As long as there are people and the hospital is here, I will stay to support and provide them services. I cannot leave.’
“He had a kind heart and was very active in providing psychological support for children and helping those in need.”
Virtually no aid has entered besieged parts in northern Gaza since early October, the UN reported on November 19. Famine is “imminent” in those areas of northern Gaza, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition, said on November 8.
On Monday, the Israeli agency that controls the flow of aid into Gaza said that the UN’s World Food Programmed collected 52 food trucks through the Erez West crossing, for distribution in the northern Gaza Strip.
“This is really purely ethnic cleansing. They’re just killing everybody. This is not a targeted operation,” Hani told CNN. “There is nothing left for them. They’re just destroying homes and kicking people out.”
“This is really reliving the Nakba,” Hani added, referring to “the catastrophe” of 1948 – when at least 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forcibly expelled from their homes in historic Palestine, during the creation of Israel.
“Mahmoud, and people like him, were doing God’s work. And that was good enough to put a target on his back,” he said. “He was punished because he was helping people fight the famine.”","['Sana Noor Haq', 'Abeer Salman']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl/index.html,Israel threatens to ‘go deeper’ into Lebanon as strikes strain ceasefire,2024-12-03 15:15:52,"As tit-for-tat strikes strain a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah less than a week since it went into effect, Israel’s defense minister on Tuesday threatened to directly target the Lebanese state should the agreement fall apart.
Monday was the deadliest day since that agreement came into force last Wednesday, with Israeli strikes killing nine in southern Lebanon after Hezbollah fired at Israeli-occupied territory, citing Israeli truce violations.
“If we return to war, we will act with strength, go deeper,” Israel Katz said during a visit on Tuesday to the 146th Division of the Israel Defense Forces, near the Lebanese border.
Were the ceasefire to collapse, he said, “there will no longer be any exemptions for the State of Lebanon. If until now we separated the State of Lebanon from Hezbollah – and the entirety of Beirut from Dahiyeh, which took very hard hits – this will no longer be the case.”
It comes a day after Israel conducted airstrikes across southern Lebanon. The attacks were retaliation for Hezbollah firing two rockets at Israeli-occupied territory – themselves a response to near-daily Israeli attacks on Lebanon beginning the day after a truce began last Wednesday.
The exchange of fire casts doubt on the longevity of the ceasefire brokered by the United States – though State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller insisted on Monday that “we have not seen the ceasefire break down.”
Both the American and French governments have privately told Israel that they believe it is violating the agreement, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the defense ministry, said in an interview with Israel’s Kan radio. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said Israel had breached the ceasefire agreement “approximately 100” times since the truce went into effect.
“Both the French and the Americans didn’t really like it,” Smotrich said, referring to Israeli strikes on Lebanon since the truce. “But the IDF, in the days since the ceasefire, is enforcing it in a very determined way, both against Hezbollah and against civilians who are trying to return to villages in the border area without permission.”
Except for Tuesday, Israel has launched daily airstrikes in Lebanon since the day after a ceasefire went into effect last week. The military has said that it acted “in response to several acts by Hezbollah in Lebanon that posed a threat to Israeli civilians, in violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.”
Those strikes led Hezbollah to target Israeli-occupied territory, at Shebaa Farms, on Monday. In a statement, the group said that Israel was guilty of “firing on civilians and airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, resulting in the martyrdom of citizens and injuries to others, in addition to the continued violation of Lebanese airspace by hostile Israeli aircraft reaching the capital, Beirut.”
Hezbollah’s rockets fell in an open area and injured no one. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “a serious violation of the ceasefire,” and Israel launched airstrikes across southern Lebanon, killing nine, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Smotrich said the IDF had struck 29 targets in Monday’s attack.
Israeli officials contend that far from violating the ceasefire, they are acting to enforce it.
“Yesterday was the first test – firing toward Mount Dov as if it were outside the usual conflict or open to interpretation,” Katz said on Tuesday, using the Israeli term for Shebaa Farms, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and has occupied ever since. “For us, it is not open to any interpretation. We responded with strength, and we will continue to do so.”
On Tuesday, the IDF said it also launched an airstrike on a car near Damascus, Syria, where it claimed to have killed a senior Hezbollah figure, Salman Nemer Jamaa, whom it accused of involvement in weapons smuggling. Hezbollah has not confirmed the alleged killing.
Israel rarely acknowledges its attacks in Syria; in a rare announcement last month, it said it struck Hezbollah intelligence assets near Damascus.
The ceasefire deal stipulates a 60-day cessation of hostilities, which negotiators have described as the foundation of a lasting truce. During that time, Hezbollah fighters are expected to retreat some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdraw from Lebanese territory. Under the agreement, Lebanon would implement a more rigorous supervision of Hezbollah’s movements south of the country’s Litani River, to prevent militants from regrouping there.
“We will act with full force to enforce all the understandings of the ceasefire agreement, and we will respond with maximum response and zero tolerance,” Katz said.",['Mick Krever'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/middleeast/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-projectiles-ceasefire-intl-latam/index.html,"Deadly Israeli strikes hit southern Lebanon after Hezbollah attacks, testing shaky ceasefire",2024-12-02 00:00:00,"Israeli strikes killed at least nine people in southern Lebanon, Lebanese authorities said Monday, the deadliest day since a ceasefire brokered by the United States and France came into effect last week.
The strikes in the Nabatiyeh governorate near the Israeli border killed five people in the town of Haris and four in the town of Tallousa, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said. Three people were injured, it added.
But the uneasy truce between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah appeared to be holding — even as the two sides accused each other of breaching the deal.
Hezbollah on Monday fired two projectiles toward Israeli-occupied territory, responding to repeated Israeli strikes that have hit Lebanon daily since Thursday, the day after the ceasefire came into force.
The projectiles landed in an open area and no one was injured, according to the Israeli military. It did not specify the type of projectile fired.
Hours later, Israel’s military said it began striking “Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon,” after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate, calling Hezbollah’s attack “a serious violation of the ceasefire.”
Lebanese state media also reported that Israeli drones flew low over Beirut and its southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold. CNN teams on the ground reported hearing a drone flying low over the Lebanese capital.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier Monday that its own cross-border strikes, despite the ceasefire, had been “in response to several acts by Hezbollah in Lebanon that posed a threat to Israeli civilians, in violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.” It said it had struck military vehicles at a Hezbollah missile manufacturing site in the Beqaa Valley and tunnels near the Syrian border in northern Lebanon.
The United States and France have both warned Israel they believe it has violated the ceasefire terms, according to CNN affiliate Kan and Israeli news outlet Ynet.
A source with the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said Israel has breached its ceasefire agreement with Lebanon “approximately 100” times since the truce went into effect last week. CNN has asked the IDF for comment.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told his French counterpart in a phone call that his country is, in fact, enforcing the ceasefire – which stipulates Hezbollah’s withdrawal from the Israel-Lebanon border area – rather than violating it, Sa’ar said on X Monday.
“The presence of Hezbollah operatives south of (Lebanon’s) Litani is a fundamental violation of the agreement and they must move north,” Sa’ar said, adding that Israel is “committed to the successful implementation of the ceasefire understandings.”
Hezbollah, in a statement, said it targeted Israeli military positions “in light of the repeated violations initiated by the Israeli enemy of the ceasefire agreement.” Hezbollah accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire by “firing on civilians and airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, resulting in the martyrdom of citizens and injuries to others, in addition to the continued violation of Lebanese airspace by hostile Israeli aircraft reaching the capital, Beirut.”
The IDF said the two Hezbollah projectiles were fired toward Shebaa Farms, known in Israel as Har Dov (Mount Dov), which under international law is considered occupied Syrian territory. Israel seized Shebaa Farms, along with the Golan Heights, from Syria after it was attacked in 1967. The US recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights in 2019.
A shaky start
Since the early hours of last week’s ceasefire, both sides have accused each other of violations — and the escalating tensions risk endangering the agreement altogether.
A senior Israeli official said Friday that the military intends to aggressively and unilaterally act against any ceasefire violations by Hezbollah.
Unilateral Israeli military action to enforce the ceasefire was not enshrined in the agreement between Israel and Lebanon, but the US provided Israel with a separate letter that provided assurances about the Jewish state’s right to act under certain scenarios, Israeli officials told CNN earlier.
US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday that the truce has not broken down. “Broadly speaking,” the ceasefire “has been successful,” he said.
“Obviously, when you have any ceasefire, you can see violations of it,” Miller acknowledged. He noted that the US and France had set up a mechanism “to look at all of these reports of violations of the ceasefire and deal with them through the channels that the mechanisms set up, and that’s what we’ll do over the coming days.”
Miller would not say whether the US had determined that any of the alleged violations breached the truce, saying the work was ongoing. He also would not comment on reports that US envoy Amos Hochstein had raised violations in a letter to the Israeli government.
The ceasefire deal stipulates a 60-day cessation of hostilities, which negotiators have described as the foundation of a lasting truce. During that time, Hezbollah fighters are expected to retreat some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdraw from Lebanese territory.
UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last all-out war between the two sides in 2006, has been the basis of the deal and the negotiations have mainly revolved around the treaty’s enforcement.
Under the agreement, Lebanon would implement a more rigorous supervision of Hezbollah’s movements south of the Litani river, to prevent militants from regrouping there.
UN peacekeeping troops, the Lebanese military, and a multinational committee are tasked with supervising the Iran-backed group’s movements.","['Mick Krever', 'Charbel Mallo', 'Ruba Alhenawi', 'Tamara Qiblawi', 'Lauren Izso']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/middleeast/israel-idf-gaza-moshe-yaalon-palestinians-ethnic-cleansing-intl/index.html,Northern Gaza: Former defense minister Moshe Ya’alon accuses Israel of ethnic cleansing,2024-12-02 14:32:20,"A highly decorated former Israeli defense minister has caused a firestorm by accusing Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in northern Gaza.
Moshe Ya’alon, who served for three decades in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), including in the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit, and as the military’s chief of staff, also said that he believed Israel was losing its identity as a liberal democracy and becoming a “corrupt and leprous fascist Messianic state.”
“Conquering, annexing, ethnic cleansing – look at northern Gaza,” Ya’alon told Israel’s Democrat TV.
The interviewer expressed surprise at Ya’alon’s use of the phrase “ethnic cleansing,” asking, “Is that what you think – that we’re on the way there?”
“Why ‘on the way?’” he responded. “What’s happening there? There’s no Beit Lahia. There’s no Beit Hanoun. They’re currently operating in Jabalya, and essentially, they’re cleaning the area of Arabs,” he said, referring to the IDF.
The Israeli military has for two months been carrying out an intense and deadly operation in northern Gaza, targeting what it says are resurgent Hamas militants. It has told all civilians that for their own safety, they must go to a humanitarian area in southern Gaza. Thousands of Palestinian civilians have refused to leave, after more than a year of being told to evacuate to areas of Gaza that are then also targeted by Israeli strikes. Vanishingly few aid deliveries have been allowed into northern Gaza, according to the World Food Programme.
The Israeli military, responding to Ya’alon, denied that it was ethnically cleansing northern Gaza and said that it operated “in accordance with international law, and evacuates civilians based on operational necessity, for their own protection.”
The government has not yet presented a plan for post-war governance in Gaza. It has also denied it is implementing a “surrender or starve” proposal in northern Gaza put forward by a retired military general, Giora Eiland – though it did consider the plan.
“I held up a mirror to the statements of many ministers and Knesset (parliament) members in the government,” Ya’alon said in a second interview, with Channel 12. “Under this title, ethnic cleansing is effectively being carried out; I don’t have another word for it.”
The interviewer said that such a phrase evoked “dark periods” in history.
“That’s right, and I purposely used this term to ring the alarm bells,” the former defense minister responded.
Extremist factions in Israeli politics have called for Jewish settlement in Gaza nearly since the outset of the war , following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack. Soldiers serving in Gaza have regularly promoted the return of Gush Katif – Gaza settlements destroyed when Israel unilaterally withdrew from the territory in 2005. And the ideas have gained traction: In October, hundreds of activists and several senior sitting ministers attended a Gush Katif conference near the Gaza border.
“We need to stay there, we need to establish a flourishing Jewish settlement there,” Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said in an interview with Israel TV channel Kan on Monday. “Both because this is the land of Israel and also because this guarantees the security of the residents of the South.”
Ya’alon joined a growing chorus in recent weeks referring to Israel’s military operation in northern Gaza as “ethnic cleansing.”
Israeli newspaper Haaretz published an editorial at the end of October titled: “If it looks liked ethnic cleansing, it probably is.” Human Rights Watch last month said in a 154-page report that Israel had overseen the forced mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza in a deliberate and systematic campaign that amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, said he believes that “it is not by chance that the words ‘ethnic cleansing’ are increasingly used to describe what is going on in north Gaza.”
The International Criminal Court last month issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, saying it had “reasonable grounds” to believe that Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes including “starvation as a method of warfare” and “the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.” It also issued a warrant for a senior Hamas official.
The former defense minister said that upon seeing what’s happening in Gaza, he could no longer use the oft-cited monicker for the IDF as the “most moral” military in the world.
“The IDF is not the most moral army today,” he said. “It’s hard for me to say that.”
His intervention drew harsh criticism from former military colleagues. “To lie and harm the State of Israel and the IDF is not following a compass – this is lawlessness,” the politician Benny Gantz, who also served as IDF chief of staff, said in a statement. “The IDF has bent over backwards to minimize loss of civilian life,” Naftali Bennett, who also served in the Sayeret Matkal commando unit, said. “The population is moved away from danger for its own safety. It is not only the IDF’s right to do so, itis its obligation.”
Ya’alon said that while military commanders may believe their actions are purely operational, politicians have other plans in mind – and his words were aimed at them.
“I’m talking about soldiers moving populations, thinking it’s for operational purposes,” Ya’alon said. “But the intention of Smotrich, Ben Gvir, Strook, and Daniela Weiss” – all avowed settlers – “is an open and declared one.”",['Mick Krever'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/world/omer-maxim-neutra-american-israeli-hostage-dead-intl/index.html,"American-Israeli soldier held hostage in Gaza was ‘killed on October 7,’ Israel says",2024-12-02 12:38:55,"The Israeli military said Monday that Omer Maxim Neutra, an American-Israeli citizen who was previously believed to be alive and held hostage in Gaza, was killed during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.
Neutra, 21, served as a tank platoon commander in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the time of the attack, the IDF said, adding that Neutra’s body is still being held hostage in Gaza. It is unclear what caused the IDF to make the announcement. In previous cases when a hostage was declared dead, the finding was based on new intelligence and evidence.
“Omer loved sports, playing soccer, basketball, and volleyball, and served as the captain of his school’s sports teams,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. “Family and friends described him as a warm, optimistic, and caring individual who ‘lights up the room the moment he enters.’”
Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that Neutra “fell in a heroic battle near Nir Oz on October 7.” Nir Oz, a small kibbutz near Gaza in southern Israel, was one of the communities worst impacted by the terror attacks of October 7, with one in four residents murdered or kidnapped.
Neutra’s parents Ronen and Orna Neutra spoke to CNN last week, describing the pain of having to celebrate their second Thanksgiving without their son at the table.
Believing Omer to be alive, they said they were hoping the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon could serve as a “time to refocus” on securing his release.
“We have seen that attention both in Israel and around the world was taken from the war in Gaza to the war in Lebanon in the last four or five months, and that was a concern to us,” Ronen Neutra said. “But at the same time, we are disappointed that it was not combined with a hostage deal, which is really the most urgent element right now. We consider it a missed opportunity.”
Neutra was one of seven American citizens held in Gaza. Four, including Neutra, have been pronounced dead.
US President Joe Biden said in a statement on Monday that he and first lady Jill Biden were “devastated and outraged” following the announcement of Neutra’s death.
“Less than a month ago, Omer’s mother and father joined me at the White House to share the pain they’ve endured as they prayed for the safe return of their son – pain no parent should ever know,” Biden wrote in the statement.
“During this dark hour – as our nation joins Omer’s parents, brother, and family in grieving this tragic loss – we pray to find strength and resilience. And to all the families of those still held hostage: We see you. We are with you. And I will not stop working to bring your loved ones back home where they belong,” the president added.
‘Devastating’ news
The announcement of Neutra’s death sparked an outpouring of grief from Israeli officials. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called him “a person of great values, rich in talents, and a Zionist in every fiber of his being.”
Israel’s President Isaac Herzog, who has met Neutra’s family on several occasions, described the news of his death as “devastating.”
“Omer was born and raised in the United States and chose to (come) to Israel, and enlist in the IDF to stand in the defense of our people,” Herzog said.
The news of Neutra’s death came just days after Hamas released a video of Edan Alexander, one of the three Israeli-American hostages still believed to be alive in Gaza.
The propaganda video was released on Saturday. It shows Alexander, 20, who appears to be under duress, stating he has been held captive for more than 420 days and begging Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President-elect Donald Trump for his release. Monday marked 423 days since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted.
Speaking in front of thousands at a rally on Saturday night at “Hostage Square” in Tel Aviv, Alexander’s mother Yael Alexander said she was “shaken by the video.”
She told the crowd she had been contacted by the Israeli leader following the release of the video.
“My Edan, my love, we miss you so much. I want to tell you that following your request, about an hour ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called me. He strengthened me and assured me that now, after the deal in Lebanon, the conditions are ripe to release you and bring you home,” she said.
According to Israeli authorities, Hamas is holding 101 hostages in Gaza – 97 taken on October 7, 2023 and four others who were kidnapped before that. At least 37 of the hostages have now been confirmed dead by Israel. The hostages include 13 women and two children under the age of five, according to the authorities.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/palestinian-boy-killed-israel-east-jerusalem/index.html,"A Palestinian boy was killed by Israeli forces. Eight months later, his family still seeks answers",2024-12-01 10:50:25,"The six days after Rami Al-Halhouli was shot dead by the Israeli police near his home in East Jerusalem were a nightmare for his loved ones.
Israeli authorities were holding the 12-year-old boy’s body at an undisclosed location, refusing to release it for burial unless the family agreed to hold only a small, private funeral for him for fear of the event sparking riots.
“They threatened us that if anything happened, if any clashes happened, they would take his body from us,” Cindy Al-Halhouli, Rami’s older sister, told CNN.
Rami’s father Ali Al-Halhouli told CNN he eventually agreed. He was too scared to ask what would happen if he refused, he said.
Rami was killed on March 12, the second night of Ramadan. He and other children from the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem were letting off fireworks – a Ramadan custom – at a parking lot next to Rami’s home when he was shot in the chest, the bullet fired from a distance.
He is one of at least 169 children – 164 boys and five girls – killed by Israeli forces and Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 last year, according to United Nations data.
It was an exceptionally deadly period for Palestinian children living in the area: More were killed in a single year than in the previous seven years combined. The vast majority were shot with live ammunition, most in the head or upper body, according to the UN.
The UN and multiple international human rights groups have alleged that Israeli security forces are operating in an atmosphere of impunity across the occupied territories. The groups say most deaths are never investigated, with no accountability or consequences for those responsible for them. The Israeli authorities usually declare such killings to be in response to unspecified threats, without giving any details about the victims.
More than eight months after his killing, Rami’s family is still searching for answers.
They told CNN they haven’t been told if or why he was targeted; they were not allowed to see his body or the autopsy report; and they were not informed of any investigation into the incident.
At the time of the shooting in March, an Israeli police spokesperson said police had responded to a “violent disturbance” at the refugee camp and that an officer fired “towards a suspect who endangered the forces while firing aerial fireworks in their direction.”
CNN has repeatedly asked the Israeli police for information on the case but has not received any answers.
Searching for answers
Rami’s room in the family home remains untouched. A poster of a red Audi is pinned to the wall, Rami’s swimming goggles and a towel still hang on a mirror as if he had just put them there. The clothes he was wearing that day are laid out on the bed. The white T-shirt has a small, bloody hole in the middle.
The whole home, a modest apartment in a multistory building that can only be reached by the narrowest of streets, is decorated with photos of Rami. A sideboard has been turned into a small shrine with candles and an engraving of the family’s favorite picture of him, showing Rami sharply dressed, wearing a bowtie.
Ali Al-Halhouli said he went to the local police station several times to demand answers about what happened to his youngest child but was always given the runaround. The police first told him there was no file on Rami, he recalled, and then said that if he wanted to see any documents, he’d need special clearance.
“We only want to know how he died,” Al-Halhouli said. “But instead, they just investigated each one of my sons and nephews, asking them questions.”
A video filmed by another child in the parking lot indicates that the shot that killed Rami was fired from the direction of a police watchtower at a heavily militarized checkpoint controlling access to the camp. The reinforced concrete structure stands in an elevated position some 60 meters (66 yards) away from where Rami and his friends were playing, with several barriers between the two locations. The police have not confirmed where the fatal shot came from.
“We all heard a big explosion, and everyone jumped up because the children were screaming downstairs. We initially thought that one of the fireworks exploded in his hands,” Cindy told CNN.
“We don’t understand why they fired live ammunition. It seems that they saw a group of children and they targeted them,” she said.
The video shows Rami lighting the fuse of a firework before a loud bang is heard. As he falls to the ground, the firework in his hands goes off, lighting the sky above him. He appeared to have been aiming the firework in the general direction of the tower, but not directly at it.
“If the shooting was a result of the game that they were playing with the firework, then there was no danger whatsoever to anyone, and therefore there was no reason for the killing,” the family’s legal representative, Leah Tsemel, told CNN in an interview.
Tsemel is an Israeli lawyer who has devoted her career to defending Palestinians living under Israeli occupation, including some who have been convicted of violence against Israelis.
She has been trying to force the Israeli authorities to share any documents they have with the family, she said, and is determined to go to court if needed.
“If there was an interrogation of the police officer involved, I want to see all the documents from it. If there was no interrogation, I asked them to please immediately investigate this case and conduct an interrogation,” she said, adding that the police have so far failed to respond.
Tsemel said that instead of investigating Rami’s death, the Israeli authorities appeared to be using the incident as a threat. She said leaflets urging parents to “take care of their children” have been distributed around the camp. They warn that “negative events” happen to those who ignore police guidance.
No man’s land
The Shuafat refugee camp has long been considered something of a no man’s land, an overcrowded urban island where nobody is in charge and even basic resources are hard to come by.
The camp, established in 1965, sits inside Jerusalem’s municipal borders, which means its residents pay local taxes and the main responsibility for its administration lies with the Israeli authorities. The municipality told CNN it provides “a range” of services in the neighborhood, but locals and international humanitarian and human rights organizations said this range is at best limited. The roads are full of litter and potholes, with raw sewage and piles of uncollected garbage posing a health risk.
The whole neighborhood is densely packed, its narrow streets and alleyways lined with apartment buildings extended upward over time to make the most of limited space. The camp is cut off from the rest of annexed East Jerusalem by Israel’s separation wall.
Anyone wanting to leave it for other areas of Jerusalem is required to go through airport-style security that includes a walk-through metal detector, an X-ray machine for belongings, an ID check, as well as occasional pat-down and strip searches. The Israeli authorities have on occasions shut the checkpoint without notice and the rules on who can and cannot go through it keep changing, so people can be turned away for seemingly random reasons.
And while there is no restriction on movement to and from the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority is not allowed to run the Shuafat camp, because it is inside Jerusalem’s borders.
This leaves it up to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to provide most services, including education, sanitation, health and social care.
But UNRWA is facing an existential threat after Israel’s Parliament, the Knesset, voted last month to ban the agency from acting within Israel.
“There’s a huge amount of anxiety in the camp because of the importance of our services – and the demand for our services has been rising because of the economic problems,” UNRWA’s senior communications manager, Jonathan Fowler, told CNN.
The camp is notoriously overcrowded, with no parks or green spaces, which may explain why Rami and his friends were playing in the run-down parking lot when he was shot.
He and other children would often hang out there, noting down the license plate numbers of cars that were coming and going. Undercover operations by Israeli security forces are common in the camp, so any unknown vehicle immediately sparks anxiety among the residents.
Yousef Mukheimar, a local community leader, told CNN the unique position of the camp means the residents have no protection against crime, with criminal gangs and drug dealers frequenting the neighborhood.
“The Israeli police does not care about what is going on in here and about protecting the public; they only conduct security actions that are related to them, and Palestinian security is not allowed to come here,” he said. Most residents would never seek help from the Israel Police, he added, because it is perceived as an enemy force responsible for violence and oppression.
Mukheimar told CNN incursions by Israeli security forces have become more common and increasingly violent in the past year. UNRWA said that among the 19 camps it operates in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Shuafat experienced the second highest number of confrontations between residents and Israeli forces in 2023.
During one incursion in September, Israeli forces shot and killed another child: 16-year-old Hani Al-Qirri.
His family told CNN he was an innocent bystander, a quiet boy who enjoyed baking and lived with his grandmother after being orphaned as a young child.
The Israel Police told CNN he was “a terrorist who shot fireworks at them” and was “neutralized.” Asked by CNN about any evidence that would back up that claim, the police spokesperson did not provide any.
Al-Qirri was buried immediately after his death. His grandmother told CNN she did not want to wait for any investigation, fearing that, as in Rami’s case, the Israelis would take his body away from the family.
Israeli authorities, as well as some Palestinian militant groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, have long used bodies as bargaining chips. Both Islamic and Jewish laws require bodies to be buried as soon as possible after death, so any delay can be very distressing to the bereaved.
In 2017, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the Israeli state had no authority to do so, in response to a legal petition filed by the human rights group Adalah.
But within a few months of the court’s ruling, the Knesset passed a new law that allows the police to withhold the bodies of Palestinians who were suspected of carrying out or attempting to carry out a terrorist act, until the bereaved families agree to any restrictions placed on the burial and funeral procession.
Rami’s family was finally reunited with his body at 1 a.m. on March 18. An Israeli ambulance brought him to a checkpoint far from the family’s home.
They were not allowed to bring Rami home or bury him in the family plot at the Lions’ Gate Cemetery just outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem.
Instead, he was buried in a neighborhood several miles from his home, where the family knew no one. The funeral, as demanded, was a muted affair.
And yet, even that was not enough for the Israeli authorities, who for days after the ceremony kept contacting Ali Al-Halhouli, repeatedly asking him to identify people in videos taken during the funeral.
“They (the Israeli authorities) were there, right among us, even inside the mosque, to see what’s going on,” he said.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Abeer Salman']",en

The developments underscore the worsening humanitarian situation in the enclave, where tens of thousands of people have been killed by the Israeli military, and chronic hunger threatens the remaining civilian population. On Friday, two children and a woman were crushed to death while attempting to buy food from a bakery in central Gaza.
The deadly strikes also come with an uneasy truce underway between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said would allow his forces to focus on Gaza.
Speaking to CNN on Sunday, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, said that five buildings housing more than 200 people were struck in the Tal Al Zaatar and Beit Lahiya areas of northern Gaza.
“They were calling for help, and anyone who tried to assist was bombed. Unfortunately, the cries for help have disappeared; they were killed,” Dr. Abu Safiya said. The strike in Tel Al Zaatar left more than 100 people under the rubble, with only one person pulled out.
“This scene has become a daily occurrence, and no one is held accountable; no one can stop the killing of innocent people.”
The spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense said that more than 40 people belonging to the “Al-Araj” family were killed in a single strike on a building in the Tel Al Zaatar neighborhood.
CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for further comment on the target of the strikes and the measures taken to mitigate civilian casualties.
According to the Health Ministry in Gaza, at least 44,429 people have been killed and more than 105,000 injured in the enclave since the war began last year. The figure is thought to be an underestimate, as much of northern Gaza is inaccessible and many casualties never arrive at a hospital to be counted.
UN pauses aid deliveries
The deadly strikes coincided with the theft of trucks carrying food and other supplies into the besieged strip, prompting the UN agency for Palestinian refugees to halt aid deliveries through the main crossing point between Israel and Gaza.
The “difficult decision” to stop deliveries through Kerem Shalom comes at a time when “hunger is rapidly deepening,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini warned Sunday.
The decision was made after a “few food trucks” were “taken” on the route Saturday, he wrote on X. A source involved in transferring aid inside Gaza told CNN that a further five trucks loaded with flour were stolen near the crossing Sunday.
“The road out of this crossing has not been safe for months,” Lazzarini noted in his post, referring to an incident on November 16 when almost 100 aid trucks were stolen by armed gangs in what UNRWA described as “one of the worst” incidents of its kind.
The humanitarian operation in Gaza had become “unnecessarily impossible,” he added, citing hurdles from Israeli authorities and political decisions to restrict the amounts of aid as compounding factors in the breakdown of law and order in the enclave.
Lazzarini stressed that Israel, as the occupying power, was responsible for the protection of aid workers and supplies. Israeli authorities “must ensure aid flows into Gaza safely and must refrain from attacks on humanitarian workers,” he said.
COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, said that “dozens” of other humanitarian organizations continued delivering supplies to people in the enclave.
“Last week, over 1,000 trucks carrying humanitarian aid were collected from the various crossings and distributed throughout the Gaza Strip,” the agency added in a statement shared with CNN. “We will continue to work with the international community to increase the amount of aid making its way into Gaza, through the Kerem Shalom Crossing as well as the other four crossings between Israel and Gaza.”

One of the victims’ father, Osama Abu Al-Laban, told CNN he gave his 17-year-old daughter money to buy a loaf of bread with her sister before she got swept up while waiting in the women’s queue.
“Where did she go? How did she get in? How did she leave? I don’t know. I only found her when they brought her out dead. I have no idea what happened,” Al-Laban said.
Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, said it received the three casualties.
Bakery lines have become sites of desperation and overcrowding as Palestinians fight to find food for themselves and their family.
Hunger has mounted in the Strip as the food crisis worsens during Israel’s ongoing intense military operation in the north. Aid agencies have warned that people there are on the brink of famine, some telling CNN that commercial traffic into Gaza had “ground to a complete halt.”
The World Food Programme has previously warned that bakeries in central Gaza are facing severe supply shortages.
“Bread is a lifeline for many families – often the only food they can access. Now, even that is slipping out of reach,” it said in a recent tweet.
“The suffering here is unimaginable. I’ve been standing for four hours trying to get a single loaf of bread. Four hours, and I still can’t bring bread home,” Gaza resident Karam Afali told CNN outside the same bakery where the three Palestinians died.
Earlier this week, three women were killed by gunfire while lined up at a bakery in Deir al Balah, according to a statement from their families sent to CNN.
The United Nation’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has warned that armed looting – fueled by the breakdown in public order and safety in Gaza – has become increasingly organized.
The agency has said the the challenges involved in delivering aid to Gaza had become “increasingly insurmountable,” with “trucks frequently delayed at various holding points, often looted, and subjected to escalating attacks.”

The truce between Hezbollah and Israel had just begun, ending a two-month war. Mallah says he took to repairing his home and businesses “almost immediately.”
“My 24/7 bakery is going to be open for business tonight,” said Mallah on Friday, his chest widening and his voice bursting with triumph. Behind him, five employees, decked out in the bakery’s red and white uniform, were refitting the countertops at the storefront.
It was the third day of an increasingly uneasy ceasefire. The Israeli military had just issued an order demanding that Lebanese inhabitants of the country’s southern-most villages refrain from returning to their homes.
The nascent agreement is in its most fragile state. In the 60-day aftermath of the deal, Israel will withdraw its forces as the Lebanese army ramps up its presence in south Lebanon to ensure that the area is free of Hezbollah’s arms. But a complete absence of trust between the two sides – officially enemy states – means that the phased unfolding of the deal could fall apart at any moment, with both sides already accusing the other of violating the ceasefire agreement.
There have been a number of reports of Israeli forces on the Lebanese side of the border firing at people and villages, while Israel claims it has observed Hezbollah regrouping.
“I’m optimistic,” said Mallah, counting his prayer beads with one hand. “Even if the ceasefire collapses, we’ll just do the whole thing all over again. I was raised this way and I’ll always be this way. Nothing can break our spirits.”
Traffic jams have returned to Hadi Nasrallah Avenue in Lebanon’s capital, the southern suburbs’ main boulevard named after the son of late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. It cuts through the dense urban area where barely any building has been spared the damage wrought by two months of Israel’s near nightly airstrikes here.
This is Hezbollah’s seat of power where around one million people live, most of whom heeded Israel’s evacuation orders.
Shards of glass crack underfoot and rubble falls from above as people sweep away the damage from their flats, lobbing detritus off balconies. A gathering crops up around a pickup truck loaded with speakers blaring Hezbollah anthems. A handful of people carry posters of Nasrallah, who was killed in a massive Israeli airstrike just over two months ago, and who has not yet had a public funeral.
The mood is somber, but defiant. Hezbollah’s leaders appear to hope for a repeat of 2006 when the fiery Nasrallah addressed large crowds with rousing speeches, and when a ceasefire with a formidable Israeli military was accepted by Hezbollah supporters as a “divine victory.”
On Friday, Nasrallah’s successor – Secretary-General Naim Qassem – used similar language. “We are victorious because we prevented the enemy from destroying Hezbollah,” said Qassem, the elderly cleric who was Nasrallah’s long-time deputy, but lacks his predecessor’s charisma and fiery oration. “This is a victory because the resistance persisted and continues to persist.”
There are several parallels between the two all-out wars that raged between Hezbollah and Israel. The same agreement that ended the 2006 war was used by Lebanese officials to bring about a ceasefire more than two decades later. As in 2006, Israel’s current leaders vowed, but failed, to destroy Hezbollah. And the current rush of displaced people returning to their damaged and destroyed towns and neighborhoods is a mirror image of those emotional scenes from the aftermath of the previous war.
But the differences are also stark. Israel has decimated Hezbollah’s top military brass and Nasrallah’s absence is acutely felt. Hezbollah has also made some major concessions, reneging on a promise to only cease its rocket fire on Israel’s northern-most territory after Israel ended its ongoing, devastating offensive in Gaza. It has also agreed to a rigorous enforcement of the 2006 agreement, which stipulated that Hezbollah’s forces retreat to around 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon frontier.
And trouble is brewing at home. Inside Lebanon, there is a widely held belief that Hezbollah has emerged from this war as a shell of its former self, which may cause long-festering domestic tensions to flare.
Still, Hezbollah’s robust support base console themselves by reminding themselves that things could always have been worse, and that they were spared the fate of the Palestinians in Gaza. They also argue that the militant group, complete with its ballistic and medium-range missiles, remains one of the best-armed non-state actors in the world.
“The war was longer than we’d hoped it would be, but in the end we were victorious and that’s all that matters,” said 25-year-old Marwa from her badly damaged home in the southern suburbs of Beirut. She said that she stepped into her home after two months of displacement not knowing how extensive the damage would be.
“I couldn’t even tell you how difficult it was to see my home covered in broken glass, to see my memories ripped apart,” she said, her eyes welling up with tears. “We’ve been working nonstop, just so we can be able to have a coffee at home.”
“When we first got home, we were shocked… Barely anything was left untouched,” she said, her eyes welling up with tears. “I hoped to be able come back home after all that time. And then I found that I couldn’t stay… But it’s ok. It’s all material stuff. It can all be replaced.”
Others are less lucky. Umm Hussein, 41, stayed put as she watched throngs of returnees on the television screen. Unlike most of the displaced, she had already seen photographs of her home in the south of Beirut. An Israeli airstrike had destroyed it.
“Throughout this war, I was patient with my displacement,” said Umm Hussein on the day the ceasefire went into effect. “But today, I watch these scenes and I feel like a prisoner.”","['Tamara Qiblawi', 'Muhammad Darwish']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-lebanon-israel-analysis-intl/index.html,Gaza’s hopes for ceasefire dim despite renewed US efforts following Lebanon truce,2024-11-30 06:00:48,"As an uneasy truce between Israel and Hezbollah offers the Lebanese a desperately needed reprieve, Palestinians in Gaza feel abandoned, even as the US pushes for a renewed effort to end the fighting in the enclave.
For almost a year, Hezbollah vowed not to stop battling Israel until it agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza. In September, Israel stepped up its campaign against the Lebanese militant group, assassinating its top brass and launching a ferocious aerial and ground operation into southern Lebanon, which forced Hezbollah to abandon its condition for a ceasefire.
“Gaza is left alone. Hezbollah has its own calculations to abandon Gaza to preserve what was left of its forces… it’s not to our advantage,” said Hatem Mohamed, 47, a resident of Gaza City. “This agreement will allow Israel to only focus on the Palestinians and what is left of the Palestinian cause.”
Negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages have been deadlocked for months, with both sides refusing to compromise on their demands.
Qatar, a key mediator in previous Gaza ceasefire negotiations, stepped back from its role this month and shut Hamas’ political office in the capital Doha after concluding that the two sides are no longer negotiating in good faith. Turkey, which has ties to Hamas, dispelled reports that the group’s bureau had been relocated to the country, but said that Hamas officials come and go from the country on a regular basis.
“I don’t think a ceasefire in Lebanon has changed much for the dynamics of a Gaza ceasefire,” said Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank.
“Both sides have mutually exclusive demands and there’s no pressure on Israel to really scale back and start taking the negotiation seriously. Israel wants to destroy Hamas, keep troops on the ground and potentially resettle in the north, which is unacceptable to Hamas,” she said. “Hamas wants a total cessation of hostilities, return of people to their homes in the north and no Israeli ground presence…that’s completely unacceptable to Israel.”
Netanyahu ‘not ready’ to end the war
Despite the setbacks, Israeli and American leaders have signaled that the Lebanon truce may present an opportunity to move forward with a ceasefire in Gaza.
The outgoing Biden administration maintains that there might now be “newfound opportunity” to drive forward a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.
“Hamas is isolated. Hamas is now under pressure, and all eyes, not just from the US and Israel, but the rest of the world are going to turn to Hamas,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN this week.
On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the conditions to reach a deal to secure the release of Israeli hostages from Gaza “have improved,” but maintained that he will not agree to the end of Israel’s war in the enclave, as Hamas has not yet been dismantled.
“(I’m) ready for a ceasefire at any moment. But ending the war, I’m not ready for that, because we also need to achieve the elimination of Hamas,” he said.
President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that the US will “make another push” with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, to release the hostages and “end the war without Hamas in power.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament Wednesday his country was ready to contribute in “any way possible.” On Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Mohamed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi met in Cairo to discuss ceasefire efforts.
Hamas said Wednesday it is committed to cooperating with “any efforts” to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza after a truce was reached in Lebanon but reiterated its demand for Israel’s complete withdrawal from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Gazans to their homes.
More than 250 people were taken hostage and about 1,200 killed during the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023. The following month, more than 100 hostages were released as part of a short-lived hostage-and-ceasefire deal. Since then, a handful of hostages have since been rescued by Israeli forces. Of the 101 hostages believed to still being held in Gaza, at least 34 are thought to be dead.
Jihad Abu Yasser, a 26-year-old baker who lives in northern Gaza, called Hamas’ negotiation tactics “a failure,” saying the hostages alone were no longer sufficient leverage in talks with the Israelis.
“We remained stubborn until half the hostages died, and we are negotiating with a losing card… We have maybe less than 70 hostages alive. If the war continues and we are stalling, and the (Israelis) are stalling, the hostages will die, which is our (leverage) card,” he said, adding that most Gazans feel that way. “All are saying: What are we negotiating over?”
“People are saying if Hezbollah finished (their war) then God-willing we are close (in Gaza)…These are lies,” Abu Yasser said. “For the love of God, stop, stop, stop (the war).”",['Mostafa Salem'],en

On Sunday, the first strong storm to hit Gaza this winter was felt in all parts of the enclave.
In a makeshift displacement camp near the sea in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, thousands of families battled high tides, heavy winds and rainfall that damaged their nylon and plastic tents.
Journalists for CNN saw children walk around barefoot while their parents shoveled in the sand, attempting to build a protective barrier from the sea. Before they could make much progress, the tide washed it away.
“It’s pointless!” one man shouted.
“We came here because the sea was our only protection. And now the sea is attacking us,” another said.
The wooden poles holding up the tents, barely anchored to the ground, shook with every gust of wind. Families shuffled around them in distress, worried they’d collapse.
The head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) warned Tuesday in a post on X that as winter comes, people in Gaza “need everything, but very little comes in.”
“Winter in Gaza means people will not only die because of air strikes, diseases or hunger. Winter in Gaza means more people will die shivering because of the cold, especially among the most vulnerable including older people + children,” Philippe Lazzarini said.
In October, the amount of aid entering Gaza hit the lowest level since Israel’s war in the enclave started, according to data compiled by the UN.
COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza, said it was collaborating with the international community, including “facilitating the entry of winter supplies and shelter equipment, including heaters, warm clothing, tents and blankets.”
But UNRWA says the aid is not enough, and said Israel had blocked almost all efforts by the United Nations to deliver aid to northern Gaza in recent weeks.
The average temperature in Gaza falls to between 10°C and 20°C (50F to 68F) in December, dipping a couple of degrees lower on average in January. The rainy season typically lasts from November to February, with January the wettest month.
The water that flooded into some tents in Deir al-Balah soaked everything inside, leaving blankets and carpets a tangled, dusty mess. Large plastic sheets which served as the floor sunk into the wet sand, leaving nothing between those sheltering inside and the bare ground.
“What will keep us warm tonight?” Mohammad Younis asked, as he picked up his wet clothes.
“We’re like beggars in front of the world, and nobody cares about us. I don’t know where I’ll sleep. I’ll end up sleeping in the sea,” he cried.
The tarpaulin serving as a roof on Younis’ tent is now torn, allowing water in.
In another makeshift tent flooded by the raging sea, a displaced family of 10 sat shivering while the mother, Um Fadi, cooked over a fire. When they were displaced from Rafah months ago, she said, they were forced to shelter on the beach because there was nowhere else to go.
“We’re trapped from all directions. From the sea, from the Israelis, from not having a home, from hunger,” she said.
Families ‘cold and at risk’
After a year of war following Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel, at least 1.9 million people – or about 90% of the population across the Gaza Strip – are internally displaced, according to the UN. Many have been displaced repeatedly, some 10 times or more, it added.
The Norwegian Refugee Council said in a recent report that Israel’s continued offensive has given Palestinians fewer options for shelter this year compared to last.
“This winter, as fewer buildings remain standing, many Palestinians are forced to live in tents and makeshift shelters that provide considerably less protection against cold wind and rain,” the report said.
As of September 2024, more than 200,000 housing units in Gaza had been destroyed and severely damaged, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which added that nearly 1 million people are in need of “winterization support.”
Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought shelter in Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, designated a “humanitarian zone” by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Many are living in tents in an area with limited infrastructure or access to humanitarian aid.
In recent months, the coastal camp has been hit repeatedly by Israeli strikes, attacks the IDF says are targeting Hamas.
The tents are dilapidated after heavy rain and brutal winds.
As Sunday’s storm whipped through, people’s belongings were strewn along the beach, some having been swallowed up by the sea.
Mohammed Alkhatib, deputy director of programs for Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in Gaza said the suffering of displaced Palestinians in Gaza had “many faces” in a statement shared with CNN by MAP.
Most of the tents and makeshift shelters they rely on have been used for months and need replacement to withstand harsh winter conditions, he said.
“It is beyond imagination, knowing that they can barely survive regular weather with whatever they have… A lack of proper clothing, blankets and safe heating methods mean families will remain cold and at risk for many months,” he added. It’s a fear that haunts Um Fadi in Deir al-Balah every day.
“Tonight, we’re threatened by great danger. At any moment, the sea might engulf us. We don’t know what we will do,” she said.
Rain-soaked tents
In northern Gaza, the Israeli military is carrying out a widespread operation that has entered its second month. The bombardment has displaced up to 130,000 Palestinians since October 6, according to the United Nations Population Fund, and the need for aid is acute.
Many have sought shelter in Yarmouk sports stadium in Gaza City, where decrepit tents made of white cloth turned brown on Sunday following an evening of heavy rain.
As in the seafront shelter, young children stood barefoot on the wet asphalt or waded through puddles, wearing barely enough to keep them warm, while their parents tried to repair the damaged tents.
Weather is posing one of the biggest risks for Palestinians in Gaza now and is “another component to kill people,” Louise Wateridge, a senior emergency officer with UNRWA, told CNN on Friday from Gaza City.
“The wind and the rain is picking up and people are living in these very, very dangerous structures… this bad weather could bring these buildings down on top of people.”
Sami Salehi said he had fled “suffering, airstrikes, attacks and death” in the north, seeking shelter in Gaza City.
But water had engulfed his tent and he told CNN he had no fuel or wood to start a fire. Picking up his wet blanket and soaked mattress, he asked how he and his 14 children would sleep that night.
“This tent is made of cloth, so when water comes in, it goes everywhere. And we’re in a low-lying area, so even if the roof protects us, water will come from below,” he said.
After suffering an injury in an Israeli airstrike, Salehi said he thought he’d die, but was surprised to see that God had saved his life.
“I wish I died instead. Death is more honorable than this life.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-ceasefire-explainer-intl-latam/index.html,Israel has agreed to a truce in Lebanon with Hezbollah. Here’s what that means,2024-11-26 00:00:00,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a weekly look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon appears to be largely holding, despite accusations of violations from both sides of the border.
US President Joe Biden said the deal that took effect early Wednesday morning – raising hopes of a lasting respite after a 13-month border conflict that spiraled into an all-out war in September – “is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.”
Since then, thousands of displaced Lebanese people have begun returning to their homes in the south, despite both Lebanon’s army and the Israeli military warning residents not to return home yet.
But a fragile and complicated process must still play out over the next 60 days, and it remains to be seen how permanent the pause will be in the long term.
Here’s what you need to know about the ceasefire and the weeks ahead.
What the deal entails
The deal stipulates a 60-day cessation of hostilities, which negotiators have described as the foundation of a lasting truce. During that time, Hezbollah fighters are expected to retreat some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdraw from Lebanese territory.
UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last all-out war between the two countries in 2006, has been the basis of the deal and the negotiations have mainly revolved around the treaty’s enforcement.
Under the agreement, Lebanon would implement a more rigorous supervision of Hezbollah’s movements south of the country’s Litani river, to prevent militants from regrouping there. United Nations peacekeeping troops, the Lebanese military and a multinational committee will be tasked with supervising the Iran-backed group’s movements.
Israel has vowed to resume military operations in case of a breach of the agreement.
Will the truce hold?
The ceasefire agreement heralds much-needed respite for Lebanese civilians, hundreds of whom have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, as well as for Israelis, millions of whom have taken to shelters amid Hezbollah’s daily barrage of rocket fire.
Thousands of Lebanese have begun to travel back to their homes in the south, despite warnings from the Israeli and Lebanese governments not to return immediately.
Residents in the southern Lebanese town of Qlayaa were seen cheering and throwing rice in the air – a gesture of celebration – as a Lebanese regiment arrived in the town on Wednesday evening. Under the truce, the Lebanese military will ramp up its presence in the south to help preserve the peace.
But there are questions about how long the truce may hold. Israel insists that it will take military action in response to any breach of the agreement. That could reignite the conflict, putting US-backed diplomatic efforts in jeopardy.
Meanwhile, Hezbollah has agreed to withdraw its forces north of the Litani river, some 40 kilometers from the Israel-Lebanon frontier at its furthest point. It made that concession in 2006 but violated it, building a vast underground infrastructure in an area where its members are part of the social fabric. Israel also breached the 2006 agreement by conducting near daily overflights in Lebanon.
On Thursday, however, both countries in the agreement accused the other of violating it.
In a statement, Israel’s military that said that it had thwarted “terrorist activity” in “a facility used by Hezbollah to store mid-range rockets in southern Lebanon.”
Meanwhile, the Lebanese army said that Israel had breached the terms of the ceasefire agreement “several times” since it went into effect, through “aerial infiltrations and the targeting of Lebanese territory with various weapons.”
The violations of the 2006 truce allowed Hezbollah to strengthen its forces tremendously, while Israel gathered intelligence on the militant group that would prove to be a game-changer in the 2024 war.
Still, the truce held for nearly two decades, the longest period of calm on that political fault-line since the 1960s.
How Hezbollah and Israel got here
Hezbollah first began to fire at Israeli-held territory a day after Hamas’ October 7 surprise attack in Israel, which killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages, triggering Israel’s ongoing devastating offensive in Gaza. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah repeatedly vowed to continue firing rockets at Israel until it ceased its assault in Gaza.
In an overnight meeting that began on September 16, Israel’s war cabinet expanded its stated war goals to include the return of residents displaced in the north of the country, as Hezbollah’s daily rocket fire on northern Israel has displaced more than 60,000 Israelis from their homes.
Hours later, Israel detonated thousands of Hezbollah pagers, killing scores and wounding hundreds. That was followed by an attack on the group’s walkie-talkies the next day. On September 23, Israel launched an all-out offensive on Shia-majority areas across the country where Hezbollah wields significant influence, killing over 500 people in the deadliest day for Lebanon since its civil war that ended in 1990.
On September 27, Israel killed Hezbollah’s long-time leader Nasrallah in a massive attack in the southern suburbs of Beirut, upending the truce talks. A series of subsequent attacks decimated the group’s top brass, sending the organization even deeper underground.
Israeli attacks continued to pummel large parts of the country, mainly the Shia-majority south, east and the southern suburbs of Beirut, known as Dahiyeh, killing more than 3,700 Lebanese.
Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued to fire rockets at Israel at a steady rate, with some of the projectiles striking over 70 miles into the country. The vast majority of its missiles and drones were intercepted by Israel’s air defense systems, but some caused damage. Since October 2023, Hezbollah’s attacks on Israel have killed 47 Israeli civilians and 31 security forces in Israel. Another 46 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Lebanon.
Would this truce have an impact on the war in Gaza?
The signing of the Lebanon deal is unlikely to provide respite for Palestinians in Gaza, according to a regional analyst.
A Hezbollah-Israel agreement “means nothing for Gaza,” HA Hellyer, a senior associate fellow in security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, told CNN before the deal was signed.
“I don’t think the conclusion of any deal with regards to Lebanon is likely to make one in Gaza more likely,” Hellyer said, adding that there haven’t been substantial ceasefire negotiations in Gaza for a long time.
More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began over a year ago, according to the health ministry in the territory. Arab states, the United Nations and aid groups have repeatedly called for an end to Israel’s offensive, which has displaced almost all of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million people and flattened entire neighborhoods.
However, a senior US official last week told CNN that a deal with Hezbollah would “send a signal to Hamas” that Israel and its partners will do their utmost to secure an agreement that brings back hostages held in Gaza.
“If we have a Lebanon deal, we’re going to come down like a ton of bricks on Hamas to try to get a hostage deal,” the US official said before the agreement was signed, adding that Israel needs “to turn this military success… into a strategic success.”
The United States last week vetoed another UN Security Council resolution that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, arguing that it did not sufficiently link that ceasefire to the immediate release of the hostages in the territory.",['Tamara Qiblawi'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/28/politics/omer-neutra-family-israeli-hostage-ceasefire/index.html,Parents of American held captive in Gaza hope Biden and Trump will work together on hostage deal,2024-04-05 00:00:00,"Ronen and Orna Neutra are gathering this Thanksgiving with friends in Long Island, New York, for a moment of quiet reflection as their son Omer, an Israeli-American citizen, continues to be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.
“For us, it’s no holiday. Our holiday table is empty a second year in a row. Omer is not there,” Ronen Neutra said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. “We are hoping this is the last year that we are in this situation.”
After the US helped secure a ceasefire this week between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Neutras expressed hope the development could serve as a “time to refocus” on securing the release of their son and the other Israeli-American hostages remaining in Gaza. They said President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump each have their own strengths and should jointly work to secure a hostage deal.
“We have two presidents. We’re calling on them to work together,” Orna Neutra said. “The hostages don’t have time to wait until Inauguration Day.”
While they welcomed the ceasefire deal in Lebanon, the couple expressed some frustration that the agreement was not coupled with the release of the hostages in Gaza.
“We have seen that attention both in Israel and around the world was taken from the war in Gaza to the war in Lebanon in the last four or five months, and that was a concern to us,” Ronen Neutra said. “But at the same time, we are disappointed that it was not combined with a hostage deal, which is really the most urgent element right now. We consider it a missed opportunity.”
In their talks with administration officials in recent weeks, the Neutras said Biden’s team indicated reaching an agreement regarding Lebanon would isolate Hamas and could push them back to the negotiating table.
“We’re looking forward to that being a reality,” Orna Neutra said.
In announcing the ceasefire in Lebanon on Tuesday, Biden said the US would make “another push” to achieve a hostage deal, including working with Israel, Qater, Egypt and Turkey. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday the administration believes the Lebanon agreement provides a “newfound opportunity” for movement on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, though he offered no predictions on when or how that could come together.
The Neutras, along with other families of Americans held hostage by Hamas, have spent the last year pushing US and Israeli officials to secure a hostage deal to release their loved ones. The couple delivered remarks urging their release at the Republican National Convention in July. Four Americans, including Omer, are still believed to be held hostage, and the bodies of three Americans remain in Gaza.
The hostage families are hoping to meet with the Biden administration in the coming weeks to discuss the renewed push, the Neutras said. The families have yet to speak with Trump or his picks for key national security posts since the November 5 election.
“We are calling on President Trump to seize the moment and reach what we are calling a Reagan moment,” said Ronan Neutra, referring to the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, when Tehran released the remaining Americans held captive shortly after President Ronald Reagan was sworn in on January 20, 1981.
Biden’s fresh commitment to renew efforts to end the conflict in Gaza comes one year after the US played a key role in a multi-day ceasefire agreement that resulted in the release of more than 100 hostages in Gaza, including young American Abigail Edan.
“It’s been a year since the last release,” Orna Neutra said. “Use all your leverage. This is your moment.”
As they prepare to gather this Thanksgiving, the Neutras are continuing to hold out hope a hostage deal could come to fruition as other holidays are around the corner, noting the first day of Hannukah falls on Christmas this year.
“How wonderful it would be to have the hostages back by then,” Ronen Neutra said. “That should be the goal.”",['Arlette Saenz'],en

It starts a 60-day truce that the US and other stakeholders hope will be permanent.
In that time, troops from both sides will retreat from southern Lebanon, while the Lebanese military and families who fled in recent months will move in.
But that is a complicated and delicate process that will be closely watched in the region and beyond.
During the 60-day period of the new agreement, Hezbollah fighters are expected to retreat 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdraw from Lebanese territory, clearing the buffer area designated in a UN Security Council Resolution in 2006.
That agreement, which formed the basis of Tuesday’s deal, stipulated that Israel must withdraw all its forces from southern Lebanon, and that the only armed groups present south of the Litani river should be the Lebanese military and UN peacekeeping forces.
Israel’s forces must retreat beyond the so-called Blue Line, a “line of withdrawal” established by the UN in 2000 following 18 years of Israeli military occupation in southern Lebanon. That boundary serves as the de facto border between the two countries.
Israel launched its ground incursion into Lebanon at the beginning of October, a drastic escalation of a conflict with Hezbollah that had been characterized by daily, tit-for-tat missile strikes over the border since Hamas’ October 7 attacks in southern Israel last year.
After weeks of deadly fighting across southern Lebanon, Israel’s soldiers reached the Litani river on Tuesday for the first time since their campaign began – a symbolic milestone in the conflict just hours before the truce was agreed.
Those troops will now withdraw back into Israel. But Israeli leaders have insisted that they will take military action in response to any breach of the agreement, a warning that could reignite the conflict if realized.
The ceasefire is expected to finally end a violent chapter in the decades-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which erupted the day after October 7, when the Lebanese militants fired missiles across the border in solidarity with Hamas.
The ensuing 13 months saw daily cross-border strikes, and then near-constant volleys of missiles and rockets. Attacks ramped up in the summer, culminating in mid-September with a promise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his country would change the “balance of power” on its northern front.
Israel’s ground incursion followed on October 1, fully opening a new front of conflict in the Middle East. More than 3,000 people have been killed since Israel stepped up its campaign on September 16, according to Lebanese health ministry figures.

The Israeli security cabinet voted on Tuesday to approve the United States-brokered deal, ending more than a year of hostilities that have killed thousands.
CNN visited the border town of Shtula on Wednesday just hours after the ceasefire took effect. The frontline community is just a few hundred feet away from the Lebanese border, and was once home to some 300 residents, many of whom fled after the war began last year.
Hours into the ceasefire, Shtula remained a ghost town, with only a handful of residents living there.
While CNN was in the town, a few blasts resembling outgoing artillery could be heard nearby. At one point, CNN also heard bursts of small arms fire in the distance.
The town is one of the most dangerous places in northern Israel, having faced the threat of Hezbollah’s anti-tank missiles for months. Residents worry that the threat will persist beyond a ceasefire.
Ora Hatan, who remained in her home in Shtula, said the morning of the ceasefire deal was “unusual” after months of relentless artillery fire.
“We wake up to the quiet morning. After one year, it’s unusual,” Hatan told CNN. “It’s peaceful; we’re not woken by the bombing and running to the shelters.”
When CNN visited the border town in July, it was given just three minutes by the Israeli military to enter and exit the town, as the risk of artillery fire was too high.
Hatan’s fears have not, however, subsided with the ceasefire deal. “I don’t know how long it will hold – this agreement,” she said. “Nobody knows.”
But unlike other northern residents who would have liked to see Israel deepen its military offensive in Lebanon and establish a buffer zone in southern Lebanon, Hatan said she does not know what option the Israeli government had other than to reach a deal.
“What other option that we have? To arrive to Beirut?”
The 60-day ceasefire aims to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, a nearly two decade-old agreement that stipulated that the only armed groups present south of the Litani River should be the Lebanese military and UN peacekeeping forces.
This means that neither Israeli forces nor Hezbollah fighters are permitted to operate in southern Lebanon. While the resolution was established in 2006, both Israel and Hezbollah have accused one another of breaching it multiple times since.
Tuesday’s deal was hailed by world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, who also sought to reiterate that Israel “retains the right to self-defense” if Hezbollah “or anyone else” breaks the agreement.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the Lebanon ceasefire deal needs to ensure the safety of residents in northern Israel. “The emerging arrangement will have to meet only one test – guaranteeing full security for all residents of the north,” he posted on X Tuesday.
Hezbollah ‘will come back bigger and stronger’
While mediators hope the ceasefire deal and Resolution 1701 could form the basis of a lasting truce, many northern Israelis are less optimistic.
Before the ceasefire deal came into effect, some residents of the northern city of Nahariya were skeptical of the viability of a ceasefire deal between their country and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Nahariya is just six miles (10 kilometers) from the border with Lebanon.
Guy Amilani, a resident of nearby Kibbutz Eilon who was in Nahariya for the afternoon, said he hoped a ceasefire would now bring peace, but did not believe any cessation of hostilities would be permanent.
“It will be two years of quiet then they (Hezbollah) will start to shoot again,” he said. “Then in 30 or 40 years, my kids will guard the Kibbutz gates from whatever evil will come.”
An Israeli security official said Wednesday that residents of northern Israel can decide for themselves when to return home, adding that the decisions will vary between different communities and their proximity to the border. Issues relating to reconstruction and damage will also affect when people can return, the official added.
In September, Israel added a new objective to its ongoing war, turning its focus to the Lebanon border and the thousands of evacuated citizens. It came as officials and residents of Israel’s northern region grew increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes, piling pressure on the government to act against the threat of Hezbollah’s rockets from southern Lebanon.
More than 62,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel since Hezbollah began firing at the Israeli-held Shebaa Farms the day after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, triggering more than a year of tit-for-tat strikes. The war has also displaced more than 94,000 Lebanese across the border, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.
Hezbollah has said it fired in solidarity with the Palestinians of Gaza as Israel began bombarding the strip in response to the October attacks, which killed approximately 1,200 people in Israel and saw another 251 taken hostage.
‘I can’t tell anybody to come back in this reality’
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told mayors of Israel’s northernmost communities that he will not immediately push residents to return to their homes following the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah, according to a mayor who attended the meeting.
“He said he understands that right now we cannot go back, but no one is telling us we have to go back,” Kiryat Shmona mayor Avihay Shtern told CNN. “He understands that there’s still work to do until we can go back.”
The meeting between Netanyahu and the mayors was a contentious one, coming after several mayors – including Shtern – slammed the ceasefire deal as a “surrender agreement.”
“I left very frustrated,” Shtern said, adding that Netanyahu did not manage to convince him that the agreement would leave his community safe.
Shtern said he feared Hezbollah would re-infiltrate southern Lebanon and once again pose a threat to Israel’s northern communities.
While Shtern acknowledged that the Israeli military dealt a severe blow to Hezbollah in recent months, he did not believe it would be enough to keep Hamas from regrouping and posing a threat to his community again.
“I can’t tell anybody to come back in this reality,” he said.
On Wednesday, Shtern said in a video statement: “No one is coming home, there is no decision to return.”
Ori Eliyahu, a formerly displaced resident of Shtula who returned to the border town two months ago, panned the Israeli government as a “joke” for negotiating a ceasefire agreement.
“They’ve done nothing. An anti-tank missile was shot here two days ago,” Eliyahu said Tuesday. While he has returned, he said residents with children were unlikely to do so – distrusting the deal with Hezbollah.
“Of course we do not trust them (Hezbollah),” he said.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Mike Schwartz']",en

US President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that Israel and Lebanon accepted a proposal that is “designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities” with Hezbollah. The deal went into effect at 4 a.m. local time Wednesday (9 p.m. ET on Tuesday).
The 60-day cessation of hostilities aims to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which was adopted to end a 34-day war between Israel and Lebanon in 2006, and had kept relative calm in the area for nearly two decades. That lasted until the day after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel last year, when Hezbollah attacked in solidarity, beginning more than a year of conflict.
The resolution stipulated that Israel must withdraw all its forces from southern Lebanon, and that the only armed groups present in south of the Litani river should be the Lebanese military and UN peacekeeping forces.
The United States, which is mediating between Israel and Lebanon in the current conflict, believes a return to the principles of the resolution is in the interest of both parties, but has insisted on a mechanism to enforce it more strictly. Israel has argued that Hezbollah has breached the resolution multiple times by operating close to its border. Lebanon says Israel regularly breached the agreement over the past two decades by sending fighter jets into its airspace.
Here’s what we know about the resolution and why it is critical to a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon.
A brief history
Israel launched an invasion into Lebanon in 1982, sending tanks all the way to the capital Beirut, after coming under attack from Palestinian militants in the country.
It then occupied southern Lebanon for almost two decades until the year 2000, when it was driven out by Hezbollah, created – with backing from Iran – to resist the Israeli occupation.
In 2000, the UN established the so-called Blue Line, a “line of withdrawal” for Israeli forces from Lebanon. That boundary now serves as the de facto border between the two countries.
Lebanon has however claimed that Israel did not complete its withdrawal from the country, continuing to occupy the Shebaa Farms, a 15-square-mile (39-square-km) patch of land Israel has held since 1967.
Israel claims the Shebaa Farms area is part of the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria and later annexed. The international community – with the notable exception of the United States – considers the Golan Heights to be occupied territory belonging to Syria.
Resolution 1701
Israel invaded Lebanon again in 2006 after Hezbollah killed three soldiers and kidnapped two others – in an effort to compel the release of Lebanese prisoners. The war lasted just over a month and resulted in the death of more than 1,000 Lebanese, mostly civilians, as well as 170 Israelis, mostly soldiers.
On August 11, 2006, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1701, which called for “a full cessation of hostilities” by Hezbollah and Israel.
The resolution demanded that Israel withdraw all its forces from southern Lebanon, and for the Lebanese government and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) “to deploy their forces together throughout the south.” No other armed personnel would be permitted in the area.
It also called on the Lebanese government “to exercise its full sovereignty, so that there will be no weapons without the consent of the Government of Lebanon and no authority other than that of the Government of Lebanon.”
A 10,000-troop UN peacekeeping force, UNIFIL is the main body tasked with implementing Resolution 1701 on the ground.
A UN-mediated prisoner exchange between Israel and Hezbollah in 2008 saw the return of the remains of the two Israeli soldiers captured in 2006 for five Lebanese prisoners. Israel later released the bodies of some 200 Arabs.
Escalation since October 8
Hezbollah began firing at the Israeli-held Shebaa Farms on October 8, 2023, in what it later said was solidarity with the Palestinians of Gaza, a day after Gaza-based Hamas launched a major attack on southern Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage. Israel fired back.
Between October 8, 2023 and the end of June, UNIFIL detected 15,101 cross border trajectories, of which 12,459 were from Israel into Lebanon, and 2,642 Lebanon into Israel,” the UN said on October 1, adding that “while most exchanges of fire have been confined to within a few kilometers of either side of the Blue Line, several strikes have reached as far as 130 km into Lebanon and 30 km into Israel.”
Since then, cross border skirmishes continued but were contained along the Israel-Lebanon frontier, until September this year, when Israel expanded its war aims to including the return home for residents of the north, who were displaced due to cross border attacks from Hezbollah, which said that it would only stop attacks on Israel once a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. That was followed by a massive aerial assault on Lebanon, and the October 1 ground invasion into the country.
Where each party stands on 1701
The US has relayed to Lebanon a proposal that lies within the parameters of UN Resolution 1701 and aims to achieve a 60-day cessation of hostilities, a Lebanese official has told CNN before the deal went into effect.
It focuses on stricter mechanisms to implement Resolution 1701 in the south of the country and on the role of the Lebanese army in doing so, the official said, adding that it also deals with smuggling routes through the country’s international borders.
The proposal also requires Israeli ground forces, operating in southern Lebanon since October, to withdraw.
But some officials in Israel have said that simply returning to 1701 is not enough, insisting that Israel must retain the right to strike Hezbollah targets in Lebanon after a ceasefire deal should violations occur.
Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right Israeli minister of finance, has said that “full operational freedom” for the Israeli military in southern Lebanon is “a non-negotiable condition.”
“We are changing the security paradigm and will not return to decades of concepts of containment and threats without response. This will not happen again,” he said.
Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has dismissed reports of demands to give the Israeli military operational freedom in south Lebanon as “speculation,” adding that he hasn’t seen such a clause in the proposal.
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who leads the Hezbollah-allied Amal party and is the interlocutor in talks with Hezbollah, has said that the proposal he received from the US does not include mention of Israeli military operational freedom in Lebanon, adding that the US knows that such a demand would be “unacceptable.”
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller has said that “there has been an exchange of different ideas for how to see what we believe is in everyone’s interest, which is the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701.”",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/middleeast/israel-lebanon-ceasefire-deal-approve-hezbollah-intl/index.html,"Israeli security cabinet approves Lebanon ceasefire deal, after 11th-hour strikes on central Beirut",2024-11-26 18:40:25,"A ceasefire between Israeli forces and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah took effect Wednesday morning local time, according to a timeline laid out by US President Joe Biden, after Israel and Lebanon agreed a deal to end the more than year-long conflict.
Speaking earlier in the White House Rose Garden, Biden said the deal “is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.” He said he had spoken with the leaders of Israel and Lebanon, and that both countries accepted the US proposal “to end the devastating conflict” between Israel and Hezbollah.
The Israeli security cabinet voted on Tuesday to approve the deal by a majority of 10 to one, the Israeli Prime Minister’s office said, thanking the United States for its involvement.
The 60-day ceasefire aims to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, with the hope that it could form the basis of a lasting truce.
Resolution 1701 was adopted to end a 34-day war between Israel and Lebanon in 2006, and had kept relative calm in the area for nearly two decades. That lasted until the day after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel last year, when Hezbollah attacked Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group, beginning more than a year of cross-border skirmishes.
The resolution stipulated that Israel must withdraw all its forces from southern Lebanon, and that the only armed groups present south of the Litani river should be the Lebanese military and UN peacekeeping forces.
A US senior administration official said Tuesday that while Israeli forces would not immediately withdraw as the deal went into effect, they must do so within 60 days under the terms of the agreement. During that time, Hezbollah fighters are also expected to retreat some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border.
In a symbolic milestone earlier Tuesday, Israeli soldiers reached the Litani river for the first time the military began ground operations in Lebanon in September.
In the hours before the vote, Israel drastically stepped up its strikes on Beirut, targeting central areas of the city – not just its Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs – for the first time in the conflict. At least 10 people were killed in the strikes on central Beirut, the Lebanese Health Ministry said.
Soon after Biden’s announcement, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for three buildings in the southern Beirut suburbs of Bourj Al-Barajne and Ghbaire.
In a pre-recorded televised address Tuesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah was “no longer the same” after Israel’s offensive, and gave three reasons why he is now pursuing a ceasefire.
First, to allow Israel to “focus on the Iranian threat,” Netanyahu said. Second, to replenish the country’s military forces and equipment, which he said had been depleted in part by “big delays” in the supply of weapons and munitions. And third, to leave Hamas isolated in Gaza, without Hezbollah able to fight alongside it, he said.
Although the deal represents a significant breakthrough – after months of negotiations that a US State Department spokesperson described as “incredibly frustrating” – it is not yet clear whether it will lead to a lasting peace.
Before the vote, the deal was met with fury from the more extreme wing of Netanyahu’s coalition, and trepidation from residents of northern Israel, many of whom have been displaced by the conflict, along with residents of southern Lebanon across the border.
Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir on Monday called the deal a “historic mistake” that failed to achieve the war’s main goal of returning displaced Israelis to their homes in the north. Ben Gvir has also long worked to thwart potential ceasefire deals between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
Mayors of Israel’s northernmost communities were outraged by reports that Netanyahu’s government was set to approve the deal, with one calling it a “surrender agreement” and a “disgrace on a historic scale.”
Avihay Shtern, the mayor the Kiryat Shmona – where Hezbollah fire has forced residents out of their homes – urged Israeli leaders to “stop and think about the children of Kiryat Shmona” before approving the deal.
“I don’t understand how we got from absolute victory to total surrender,” Shtern wrote in a Facebook post he shared with CNN.
In his address, Netanyahu stressed that Israel will respond “forcefully” if Hezbollah violates the agreement and attempts to rearm.
“If it tries to rebuild terrorist infrastructure near the border, we will attack. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck carrying rockets, we will attack,” Netanyahu said in a fiery speech.

Zvi Kogan, who also holds Moldovan citizenship and is a representative of Chabad, a religious movement of Hasidic Jews with communities, synagogues and other institutions in many countries, was found dead on Sunday, according to the local authorities. The 28-year-old had been missing since Thursday afternoon. Chabad’s website says he was abducted from Dubai – one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE.
Kogan’s body arrived in Israel on Monday, and his funeral took place that night in the village of Kfar Chabad, southeast of Tel Aviv.
“Dear Zvi, our dear son, we miss you, we miss you a lot,” his father, Alexander Hacohen Kogan, said at the funeral, crying.
“He loved everyone. We were blessed with many kids. He is one of the youngest. He loved his father, his mother, his brothers and sisters,” he continued.
“His happiness in life was giving to others,” he said, “he loved everyone and everybody loved him.”
Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel Kalman Bar also spoke at Kogan’s funeral, calling him the “ultimate sacrifice for the entire Jewish world.”
“There are no words that can describe the pain we all feel. There are no words through which we can mourn and comfort the family,” Bar said.
The UAE’s Ministry of Interior said on Monday it had started legal proceedings against three Uzbek nationals who were arrested in connection with Kogan’s murder. It said the authorities were committed to “swiftly take the necessary measures to uncover the details, circumstances, and motives of the incident.”
The three suspects were caught while on the run in Turkey, according to a security source. The source said Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and police force caught the suspects while they were leaving the airport in Istanbul, after the UAE government asked Turkey for help.
On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Israel would “use all means at its disposal to bring the murderers of Kogan and those who sent them to justice.”
Extending his “heartfelt condolences” to the Kogan family, Netanyahu added that “the murder of an Israeli citizen and Chabad emissary is a heinous, antisemitic act of terror.”
At the same time, an Israeli foreign ministry official told CNN that Israel would not allow Kogan’s murder to sour relations with the Arab nation and that the country would use it as an opportunity to strengthen ties.
“If anything, we will only utilize this event to further and deepen our cooperation with our Emirati colleagues,” the Israeli official said, adding that the murderers were “enemies of those who are striving to have more relations” between Israel and the UAE.
The official refused to divulge details of the investigation into the murder but said Israel is working with UAE authorities to determine whether more people are involved and if “outside influences” had a role.
There has been “very strong cooperation” with UAE authorities, the official said, adding that Kogan’s body was transported to Israel on Monday.
Israeli authorities have reissued travel advice for nationals, recommending against non-essential travel and say visitors should minimize movement and stay in secure places. The official who spoke to CNN stressed this was not a new travel warning, only a reiteration of previously issued guidance.
Kogan worked alongside other Chabad emissaries to establish and expand Judaism in the UAE. He founded the first Jewish education center in the region, as well as helped make kosher food widely available, according to the Chabad movement’s official website.
Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, vowed on Monday to bring the perpetrators to justice, saying “none will escape.”
“Zvi Kogan’s brutal kidnapping and murder in the UAE shocked and saddened the state of Israel. it was a monstrous act of terror that demands swift justice,” Danon said ahead of a UN Security Council meeting.
Kogan’s wife Rivky is a US national, whose uncle Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg was killed in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.
The White House said Kogan’s murder was “a horrific crime against all those who stand for peace, tolerance, and coesistence.”
“It was an assault as well on the UAE and its rejection of violent extremism across the board,” White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said.
“The United States is working in close coordination with Israeli and UAE authorities, and we have offered all appropriate forms of support,” Savett added.
The UAE has a small Jewish community, thought to number thousands. Last year, the Gulf state opened its first-ever purpose built synagogue. Called the “Abrahamic Family House,” the interfaith complex also houses a mosque and a church.
US President-elect Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner posted on X Monday that Kogan was “senselessly murdered to stop the historic bridges he was building between Jews and Muslims in the UAE.”
Kushner – seen by some as pivotal to the incoming US administration’s Middle East efforts – said he and his wife Ivanka Trump would donate $1 million to the Chabad of UAE.
Relations between the UAE and Israel have thawed in recent years. In 2020, the UAE became the most prominent Arab nation in decades to open relations with Israel, under the US-brokered agreement known as the Abraham Accords.
But Reuters says the public presence of Israelis and Jews has receded since the October 7 attacks. Jewish community members told the agency that informal synagogues in Dubai were closed in the wake of the attacks due to security concerns.

Netanyahu had approved the plan “in principle,” a source familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday, adding that the prime minister signaled his potential approval for the deal with Hezbollah during a security consultation with Israeli officials Sunday night.
Sources familiar with the negotiations said earlier that talks appear to be moving positively toward an agreement, but acknowledged that as Israel and Hezbollah continue to trade fire, one misstep could upend the talks.
But later Monday evening, a Lebanese official familiar with the discussions said a ceasefire is expected to be announced “within 24 hours.”
Lebanon has already agreed to the US-backed proposal, which received Hezbollah’s approval, according to multiple Lebanese official sources.
In the hours before the scheduled vote, Israel continued to pummel Lebanon with airstrikes. Early Tuesday afternoon, it struck at least 10 targets simultaneously in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Later, it bombed the area 20 times in two minutes, an Israeli military spokesperson said.
Reports that a deal was nearing were met with a mixed response in Israel. Itamar Ben Gvir, the country’s far-right National Security Minister, called the deal a “big mistake” and said it would be “a historic missed opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah.” Ben Gvir has also long worked to thwart potential ceasefire deals between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
Benny Gantz, who resigned from Israel’s war cabinet in June over Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza, called on the prime minister to make the details of the ceasefire deal public.
“It is the right of the residents of the north, the fighters and the citizens of Israel to know,” Gantz said.
Residents of northern Israel – many of whom have been displaced by the conflict, along with residents of southern Lebanon across the border – have also expressed concern about the potential deal.
Nizan Zeevi, who lives north of Kyriat Shimona in Kfar Kila village, told CNN many residents view the deal as a “surrender agreement.”
“Our government is going to sign a very irresponsible agreement that is only a replay of the same agreement” signed to end the war in 2006, Zeevi said. He said he feared the deal would in time allow fighters in the Radwan Force, Hezbollah’s special operation unit, to move closer to the border once more and “live right next to” him and his family.
“It’s my duty to my children to make sure that there is no chance for another October 7,” he said, referring to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel more than a year ago.
Diplomatic push
United States envoy Amos Hochstein said in Beirut last week that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Lebanon was “within our grasp,” but that it was ultimately “the decision of the parties.”
He met Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and parliament speaker Nabih Berri, the interlocutor with Hezbollah in the talks and said there had been “constructive” and “very good discussions to narrow the gaps.”
“We have a real opportunity to bring conflict to an end,” he added last week. “The window is now.” He departed Lebanon for Israel on Wednesday to try to bring the negotiations “to a close.”
The US-backed proposal aims to achieve a 60-day cessation of hostilities that some hope could form the basis of a lasting ceasefire.
Later Monday, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that Hochstein’s discussions had been “constructive.” He said the Biden administration believes “the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction,” but cautioned “nothing is done until everything is done.”
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller was similarly cautious, telling reporters Monday that just because an agreement is “close” does not mean it will happen. He said the process had been “incredibly frustrating.”
Israel’s Home Front Command also warned of a heightened risk of Hezbollah rocket fire before Tuesday’s crucial vote, and on Monday updated its defensive guidelines for several parts of northern Israel.
On Sunday, CNN analyst and Axios reporter Barak Ravid cited a source as saying Hochstein had told the Israeli ambassador to Washington on Saturday that if Israel did not respond positively in the coming days to the ceasefire proposal, he would withdraw from the mediation efforts.
Hochstein’s trip to the region followed Beirut responding “positively” to a US-backed proposal to stop the war, Mikati said last week, adding that large parts of the draft agreement were resolved.
Israel launched a major military offensive in Lebanon in mid-September following months of tit-for-tat border attacks which started on October 8 last year when Hezbollah attacked Israeli controlled territory in solidarity with Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza.
Since then, Israel has launched a ground invasion, killed a string of Hezbollah leaders – including one of its founders, Hassan Nasrallah – and injured thousands of people in an attack featuring exploding pagers.",['Jeremy Diamond'],en

Low-scudding, rain-laden clouds threaten to soak a group of Palestinian farmers huddling around their ramshackle sheep sheds as the Israel Defense Forces troops drive up to serve them eviction notices.
Sixty-year-old farmer Khalid Sawafta, his head swaddled in a traditional red-and-white keffiyeh, has tears in his eyes. His Israeli orders state: Vacate the land by 9 a.m. on December 4 – just 16 days away – or lose everything.
Such evictions are common in the West Bank, according to the United Nations.
Similarly, according to activist group Peace Now, in the past year alone 227 Palestinian families in the territory have been evicted, as the Israeli government has authorized more than 8,600 new housing units for Israelis in the West Bank and increased funding for settler projects.
Since Hamas’s brutal attacks on Israel on October 7 last year, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 250 others hostage, settler leaders in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have been pushing for the annexation of the whole West Bank.
The new worry for Palestinians is that Donald Trump’s pick for US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who has many fans among Israeli settlers, could accelerate their land losses.
During a visit to Israel in 2017, the former governor of Arkansas told reporters: “There is no such thing as a West Bank. It’s Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the Israeli term for the land.
“There’s no such thing as a settlement. They’re communities, they’re neighborhoods, they’re cities. There’s no such thing as an occupation.”
Israeli settler leader and activist Yishai Fleisher, who met Huckabee during several of his visits to Israel, said: “Mike recognizes our claim, (he is) not an anti-Arab, but he does recognize Jewish claim to this land.”
Fleisher thinks Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, could do even more than Trump’s last ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who helped convince the then-president to declare Jerusalem Israel’s capital – a step that was hugely popular with Israelis.
Noting that Friedman is Jewish, Fleisher said: “David Friedman has legitimacy with Israelis and Jews. I think Huckabee will have legitimacy with millions of Bible-believing folks… He just knows their language and he knows how to talk to their heart. He’s a preacher.”
But Alon Pinkas – an Israeli diplomat and former adviser to Shimon Peres, the last Israeli prime minister to take significant steps towards peace with Palestinians – believes settlers are misguided and that Trump won’t sacrifice his interests in the broader region.
“If Israel unilaterally annexes large parts, large swath of the West Bank, this is not going to fly well in the Arab world.”
Pinkas believes Trump wants to secure what Biden failed to achieve: normalization of Israel’s relations with Arab countries, the holy grail of Middle East diplomacy.
“He’s going to want to build on the Abraham Accords,” Pinkas said, referring to an agreement that normalized Israel’s ties with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. “He’s going to be pressured by the Saudis, the Qataris and the Emiratis to strike a bigger deal.”
But Israel’s war in Gaza and the killing of so many Palestinians has driven up the price of that grand bargain. Trump’s friend, the powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS, has said normalization can only happen if Israel agrees to a Palestinian state.
Former Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh thinks MBS will stick with this position. “Maybe there is an opportunity with Saudi Arabia for us, and that is why we’re closely coordinating with Saudi Arabia,” he said.
Ultimately, it’s Trump’s friends rather than Huckabee who’ll succeed in influencing the Israeli government, Shtayyeh believes. “This man is not the one who will be dictating the shots.”
Israel’s finance minister Belazel Smotrich, for his part, is hopeful that the West Bank will soon be part of his country. “The year 2025 will be, with God’s help, the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,” he said in November.
Back in Bardala, Israeli officials claim a recent security threat triggered them to build the new barrier that will almost entirely encircle Bardala and two other villages, population about 4,000, effectively cutting them off from their agricultural livelihoods.
“The goal is to displace the residents from this region,” local council leader Ibrahim Sawafta told CNN.
He shows documents he says prove Palestinian ownership of Wadi Salman, the tiny dirt valley that’s refuge to farmer Khalid’s sheep sheds, dating back 100 years.
Ibrahim said they’d appealed to Israeli officials to move the barrier, “but they refused entirely, claiming the road was already planned.”
Around Bardala, annexation is all too familiar.
Khalid, who just got his eviction notice, says he was evicted seven years ago too. “They came and demolished everything, leaving me with nothing,” he said.
The hard reality in Bardala, as elsewhere in the occupied West Bank, is that even before Trump’s approaching inauguration, the Palestinian state had become a distant dream.",['Nic Robertson'],en

Haaretz, which is widely respected internationally, has provided critical coverage of Israel’s war following the Hamas attacks on October 7, including investigations into abuses allegedly committed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as military operations expanded across Gaza and into neighboring Lebanon.
The proposal, put forward by communications minister Shlomo Kar’i, will end government advertising in the newspaper and cancel all subscriptions for state employees and employees of state-owned companies.
Haaretz described the move as an attempt to “silence a critical, independent newspaper.”
In a statement following the vote, Kar’i wrote: “We must not allow a reality in which the publisher of an official newspaper in the State of Israel will call for the imposition of sanctions against it and will support the enemies of the state in the midst of a war and will be financed by it, while international bodies are undermining the legitimacy of the State of Israel, its right to self-defense and are actually imposing sanctions against it and its leaders.”
Amos Schocken, the newspaper’s publisher, drew criticism for referring to Palestinian “freedom fighters” during a speech at an event organized by the outlet in London on October 27.
“It (the Netanyahu government) doesn’t care about imposing a cruel apartheid regime on the Palestinian population. It dismisses the costs of both sides for defending the settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists,” he reportedly said.
Following widespread criticism of the comments in Israel, Schocken clarified his comments saying that he did not believe Hamas militants were freedom fighters.
In an editorial Haaretz said that Schocken was referring to “Palestinians living under occupation and oppression in the West Bank.”
Still, it said Schocken had “erred” by referring to anyone who deliberately harms and terrorizes civilians as “freedom fighters,” arguing that the correct term was “terrorists.”
In the speech Schocken also called for international sanctions on Israeli leaders as the only way to force the government to change course.
“In a sense, what is taking place now in the occupied territories and in part of Gaza is a second Nakba,” he said. “A Palestinian state must be established and the only way to achieve this, I think, is to apply sanctions against Israel, against the leaders who oppose it and against the settlers.”
In addition to Schocken’s comments at the London event, Kar’i singled out the newspaper’s coverage of the war in his statement on Sunday.
“The decision came in the wake of many articles that damaged the legitimacy of the State of Israel in the world and its right to self-defense,” he said.
Haaretz slammed the move in a statement on Sunday, calling it “another step in Netanyahu’s journey to dismantle Israeli democracy.”
“Like his friends Putin, Erdoğan, and Orbán, Netanyahu is trying to silence a critical, independent newspaper,” the statement said. “Haaretz will not balk and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government and its leader.”
The move comes two months after the military raided and shut down Al Jazeera’s office in Ramallah and six months after the government shut down the broadcaster’s operations inside Israel in May, prompting condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups.","['Lucas Lilieholm', 'Eugenia Yosef']",en

More than 3,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since the uptick in hostilities in mid-September according to a CNN tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, underscoring the urgency of a ceasefire deal.
The regional source suggested that while the deal was closer than ever, it was not fully formed yet. US and Israeli officials cautioned no green light had been given to mediators yet.
“We are moving in this direction, but there are still some issues to address,” a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN.
In recent days Hezbollah has been considering a US-Israeli proposal for a 60-day pause in fighting that some hope could form the basis of a lasting ceasefire.
Israel launched a major offensive in Lebanon in mid-September following months of tit-for-tat border attacks which started when Hezbollah attacked Israel in solidarity with Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. Since then, Israel has launched a ground invasion, killed a string of Hezbollah leaders – including one of its founders, Hassan Nasrallah – and injured thousands of people in an attack featuring exploding pagers.
US envoy Amos Hochstein has been holding talks this week with regional officials to try to reach a deal. On Sunday, CNN analyst and Axios reporter Barak Ravid cited a source as saying Hochstein had told the Israeli ambassador to Washington on Saturday that if Israel did not respond positively in the coming days to the ceasefire proposal, he would withdraw from the mediation efforts.
Earlier Sunday, an Israeli official told CNN Netanyahu had held a security consultation regarding the ceasefire proposals.
Mounting death toll
On Saturday, Israeli attacks killed at least 84 people and injured 213, according to the Lebanese health ministry, including nearly 30 killed in a strike on a multi-story building in a densely populated neighborhood of central Beirut.
A total of 3,072 people have been killed and 13,426 injured since Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah on September 16, according to Lebanese health ministry figures.

Speaking during his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at this point Israel could not verify the images.
“We are in contact with the family, and a relevant notice has been issued to all families. Our hearts are with them,” Netanyahu said. He stressed that Israel’s government is committed to bringing back all the hostages, including those who are dead.
The prime minister also said he had spoken with the mother of the hostage purportedly shown in the photos.
“It is hard to describe the nightmare she is enduring. We embrace her and her family,” he said.
Hamas’ military wing claimed on Saturday that a female hostage had been killed in an area of northern Gaza that was “under Israeli aggression.”
It did not identify her by name but shared two photos of the hostage’s body. Israel has made no comment on the circumstances surrounding the alleged death.
More than 250 people were taken hostage and about 1,200 killed during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023.
A handful of hostages have since been rescued and in November 2023 more than 100 were released as part of a short-lived hostage-and-ceasefire deal.
Some 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, 97 of whom were taken on October 7, Israeli authorities believe. At least 34 of the hostages taken on October 7 are thought to be dead.
Israel has in the past accused Hamas of releasing footage and information about the hostages as a form of “psychological terror” aimed at ramping up pressure on Netanyahu’s government to agree a ceasefire deal.
Near-weekly protests calling for the government to secure the release of the hostages have taken place across Israel, including near Netanyahu’s residences, often involving family members of the hostages.
Last week, the pressure on Netanyahu intensified with the decision of the International Criminal Court to issue a warrant for his arrest.
Meanwhile, negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal in Gaza have all but ground to a halt.
Except for a brief flurry of activity last month, there have been no real negotiations since six Israeli hostages were executed by Hamas and discovered in a Gaza tunnel at the end of August.
Qatar announced this month it was suspending its role as a mediator in talks between Israel and Hamas after concluding that the two sides are no longer negotiating in good faith.","['Mike Schwartz', 'Sophie Tanno']",en

In the densely populated Basta area of the Lebanese capital, rescue workers were Saturday searching for survivors under the rubble after the attack featuring what the state-run National News Agency (NNA) said were “bunker-busting” bombs.
At least 66 people were injured in the strike, according to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health, while a Lebanese security source told CNN that no senior Hezbollah member was in the building leveled. The ministry revised the death toll from the attack upward Sunday, having previously reported that 20 people had died.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not issue an evacuation order for the area ahead of the strikes, and has not yet commented on the attack.
The strike, one of several in Beirut and across Lebanon Saturday, comes as Israel escalates its attacks on the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah despite ongoing ceasefire efforts.
In the southern suburbs of Beirut, Israel said it had struck Hezbollah targets Saturday morning after issuing evacuation orders covering several buildings “to mitigate harm to civilians.” NNA later reported a “very strong airstrike” in the area.
Outside the capital, Israeli strikes were also reported in the east and south of the country Saturday.
In eastern Lebanon, a strike on the town of Shmistar in the Baalbek-Hermel region killed at least 13 people, including four children, and wounded another 13, the country’s health ministry said. Strikes on other towns in the same region killed at least 11 people and wounded 32 others.
In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, an Israeli strike that hit several buildings killed five people and wounded 19, the ministry said. NNA reported Saturday that one of its reporters was 50 meters away from a drone strike on a beach in Tyre.
CNN has reached out the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the strikes in the east and south.
Meanwhile, clashes between Israel and Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon are ongoing, with reports indicating heavy fighting near the town of Khiam, a strategically important location for Hezbollah. The Israeli military has not confirmed clashes in and around Khiam.
Hezbollah said it had carried out at least 30 attacks against Israel and its troops in Lebanon Saturday with drones, missiles, and rockets, saying its actions were “ in defense of Lebanon and its people.”
Saturday’s attack in Basta marks the latest in a string of Israeli strikes on central Beirut in recent weeks, following the killing of a Hezbollah spokesperson in an airstrike last Sunday.
Most Israeli airstrikes have targeted the Lebanese militant group’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs since hostilities ramped up in recent months.
Over the past week, the Israeli air force has “struck dozens of Hezbollah command centers, weapons storage facilities, and terrorist infrastructure,” in Beirut’s southern suburbs, the Israeli military said in a statement Saturday.
Israel launched a major offensive against Hezbollah in September, killing top commanders, carrying out waves of strikes and sending troops into southern Lebanon, with the stated goal of allowing displaced Israelis to return to areas of the north.
More than 3,000 people have been killed since then, with thousands of others injured, according to the country’s health ministry. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, the UN’s refugee agency has said.
Earlier this week, United States envoy Amos Hochstein traveled to Beirut in what was seen as a sign of progress in ceasefire talks between Israel and Hezbollah. On Tuesday, Hochstein said that a truce between the two was “within our grasp.”
Hezbollah’s leader Naim Qassem said Wednesday that the group was negotiating under the condition of Lebanese sovereignty, as well as the condition that “the Israeli enemy has no right to violate, kill, or enter at will under any pretexts.”
Israeli ministers have said that any agreement must include the preservation of an intelligence capability and the right of the Israeli military to act and protect the citizens of Israel from Hezbollah.
The Israeli military continues to operate in Gaza, where the health ministry said 120 people have been killed as a result of Israeli military operations over the past 48 hours.
A senior official with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Saturday that the UN had tried to get into parts of northern Gaza for over a month.
Jonathan Whittall, head of OCHA in Palestinian territory, said Israeli forces “have denied almost all requests. The result? People are under rubble without rescue. The sick and wounded can’t reach hospitals. Safe water and food have run out. Lives are lost.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/22/world/israelis-unite-netanyahu-international-arrest-warrant-intl/index.html,Israelis unite behind their prime minister as Netanyahu faces an international arrest warrant,2024-04-26 00:00:00,"A decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Israeli officials was met with anger and annoyance at Jerusalem’s bustling Mahane Yehuda Market. But the most palpable sentiment was one of unity.
“I think it’s terrible. What about Putin? What about the real evil people?” Sarita Katzin Sarfati said about the court’s decision to call for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes committed in Gaza after the October 7 attack on Israel last year.
“Netanyahu is thinking about his people… and I think that all the world should support us and Bibi is our prime minister, and they should support Bibi as well,” Sarita told CNN, using the Israeli nickname for Netanyahu.
As shoppers rushed through the narrow alleyways of the market, Netanel Yehuda told CNN he too was outraged.
“I’m against it. We’re a nation, we are independent, and we can take our own decision here. Nobody else can tell us to put someone in jail or anything else,” he said.
That sentiment is shared by many in Israel, according to experts.
Gil Siegal, a legal scholar at the Ono Academic College in Israel, said The Hague-based court’s decision has united Israelis, many of whom believe the ICC and other international organizations, including the United Nations, are biased against their country.
“Israelis come together when under pressure,” he told CNN. “We can disagree because we think Netanyahu should do A over B, fine, but when the outer world is coming to get us, so to speak… this external pressure is a uniting force, not a breaking force,” he said.
Many Israelis still support the war in Gaza, he said, seeing it as a just fight and the only means to keep their country safe. And while many oppose Netanyahu and his government – mass protests calling for his resignation are now happening weekly – most feel he has been targeted unfairly by the ICC and see the move as an attack on Israel rather than just the prime minister.
The limited opposition to the war is motivated by the rising death toll of Israeli soldiers in Gaza and the hope that a ceasefire would secure the release of the 101 hostages still held there, with the suffering of Palestinians largely absent from the anti-war discourse.
This is partly because the shock of the brutal October 7 terror attack, during which Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people, is still raw in the country. Many Israelis know someone who was directly impacted by the attack and most have family members or friends who are currently fighting in Gaza or are serving in the military in another capacity.
Portraits of the hostages are on display across Israel, along the sea promenade in Tel Aviv and in the arrivals hall at the country’s airport.
Some Israelis are also outraged that the ICC issued warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant alongside one for Mohammed Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, the Hamas leader who Israel claims was one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack.
The ICC “is saying that Gallant and Netanyahu are equal to Mohammed Deif… this is something that Israelis truly cannot comprehend, truly, truly cannot comprehend,” Siegal said.
Yael Vias Gvirsman represents the families of hundreds of Israeli victims of the October 7 attacks at the ICC and was in The Hague on Thursday when the warrants were issued. She said the warrant against Deif was an important recognition “that Hamas attacks consisted of extermination, torture, rape and other sexual crimes and inhumane treatment” and that it was good news for families she represents. “It’s the first step for recognition and the first step for them rebuilding their lives,” she said.
But she added that the simultaneous warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant were understandably met with “great shock” in Israel, “because it is a nation at its most difficult hour.”
The court said it found “reasonable grounds” to believe that Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes including “starvation as a method of warfare” and “the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.”
More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7 last year, according to the health ministry in Gaza.
Netanyahu denounced the ICC move on Thursday, calling it an “antisemitic decision” and “a modern Dreyfus trial,” referring to the 1894 wrongful conviction of Jewish-French soldier Alfred Dreyfus, an affair that has since come to symbolize antisemitic persecution.
The prime minister said the ICC judges were “motivated by antisemitic sentiments against the one and only Jewish state.”
Meanwhile, opposition leader Yair Lapid called the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant a “reward for terrorism.”
Implications for soldiers fighting in Gaza
While the ICC arrest warrants target only Netanyahu and Gallant, some are worried about the implications for the Israel Defense Forces and its soldiers.
Conscription is mandatory for most Jewish Israelis and some 300,000 reservists have been called up because of the war, on top of the estimated 170,000 active-duty soldiers.
The right-wing Israeli legal organization Shurat HaDin has warned about the arrest warrants “creating a dangerous precedent for the ICC to target other democratic armies and leaders.” The group has long warned about the ICC possibly opening a criminal investigation against Israeli soldiers.
Legal action at the ICC against Israeli soldiers, it said on its website, would “carry devastating effects” on Israel, and cause immediate personal risk to individuals “whose only blame is for serving their country and fighting terror.”
Refusals by potential recruits and reservists to serve are rare in Israel, but there are signs that they have been increasing amid the global outrage over the toll of the war in Gaza. Taking an unusually public stance, a group of more than 130 Israeli reservists signed an open letter to Netanyahu and Gallant last month, stating that they refuse to serve unless a deal is signed to end the war and bring back the hostages, saying that for some of them “the red line has already been crossed.”
Soul Behar Tsalik, an Israeli who intends to refuse his mandatory enlistment in the IDF next week, said the ICC warrant strengthens his commitment to refuse.
“Israel’s war machine does not only destroy Gaza but also hurts Israelis – in body and in spirit,” he told CNN. “I hope the ICC’s ruling will help make a change, will make my fellow Israelis realize the truth and severity of the claims against our leaders, and push Israel to leave Gaza, free the hostages and end the occupation as soon as possible.”
Breaking the Silence, an organization of Israeli veterans who oppose the war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank, was a rare voice of support for the ICC’s decision.
It said in a statement that the “flood of condemnations, an array of whataboutisms and countless allegations of antisemitism” was indicative of the Israeli “society’s insistence, even now, to not see what we are doing in Gaza.”",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

In a statement on Thursday, the Netherlands-based court said it found “reasonable grounds” to believe that Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes including “starvation as a method of warfare” and “the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.”
The warrants mark a historic first, making Netanyahu the first Israeli leader summoned by an international court for alleged actions against Palestinians in the 76-year conflict. While ICC warrants don’t guarantee arrests, they could significantly restrict Netanyahu’s ability to travel to ICC member states.
The prime minister’s office dismissed the warrants as “absurd and antisemitic.”
“Israel utterly rejects the absurd and false actions and accusations against it by the International Criminal Court, which is a politically biased and discriminatory body,” his office said, adding that there is “no war more just… after the Hamas terrorist organization launched a murderous attack against it, carrying out the largest massacre against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.”
Netanyahu “will not yield to pressure, will not back down, and will not retreat until all the goals of the war set by Israel at the start of the campaign are achieved,” it said.
Israel, like the United States, is not a member of the ICC and has challenged the court’s jurisdiction over its actions in the conflict – a challenge the court rejected on Thursday. The ICC claims jurisdiction over territories Israel occupies, including Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank, following the Palestinian leadership’s formal agreement to be bound by the court’s founding principles in 2015.
The court on Thursday also issued a warrant for Hamas official Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, who Israel says was one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack. Israel said it killed him in an airstrike in July but Hamas hasn’t confirmed his death.
The ICC said it found “reasonable grounds” to believe that Deif was responsible for “crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, torture, and rape and other form of sexual violence, as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and other form of sexual violence.”
Deif bears “criminal responsibility” for these crimes, the court said, having “committed the acts jointly and through others… having ordered or induced the commission of the crimes,” and for failing to “exercise proper control over forces under his effective command and control.”
The court added that there are “reasonable grounds to believe that the crimes against humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack directed by Hamas and other armed groups against the civilian population of Israel.”
The ICC prosecutor had initially sought warrants for Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, both of whom have since been killed by Israel. The court said applications for their warrants were withdrawn as a result.
Hamas welcomed the warrants against Israeli officials in a statement, but made no mention of the warrant issued for Deif.
“This… represents a significant historical precedent. It rectifies a longstanding course of historical injustice against our people and the suspicious negligence of the horrific violations they have endured over 76 years of fascist occupation,” it said, calling for all nations to cooperate in bringing the Israeli leaders to justice and “take immediate action to halt the genocide” in Gaza.
Hamas had condemned the ICC prosecutor’s decision to seek warrants against its leaders in May, saying it was an attempt to “equate victims with aggressors.”
US opposes ICC action against Israel
The Biden administration has in the past come out strongly against the involvement of the ICC in investigating Israel’s war in Gaza, but said in the past it did not support sanctions against the international court.
In a statement in May, President Joe Biden said “the ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous.”
“And let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas,” he said. “We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.”
In early June, the House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction anyone involved with the ICC efforts “to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any protected person of the United States and its allies.” It has not been brought to a vote in the Senate.
Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Sunday threatened to pursue sanctions against the ICC if the international court and “and its prosecutor do not reverse their outrageous and unlawful actions to pursue arrest warrants against Israeli officials.”
“If Majority Leader Schumer does not act, the Senate Republican majority will stand with our key ally Israel and make this – and other supportive legislation – a top priority in the next Congress,” he wrote in a post on X.
President-elect Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the former ICC chief prosecutor during his first term in office.
CNN has asked the State Department and NSC for comment on the ICC’s issuance of the arrest warrants Thursday.
Israeli condemnation
Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the warrants as “a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity.”
He said in a statement on X that “the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughing stock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice.”
The decision, he added, “ignores the basic fact that Israel was barbarically attacked and has the duty and right to defend its people. It ignores the fact that Israel is a vibrant democracy, acting under international humanitarian law, and going to great lengths to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population.”
Recently appointed Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said the ICC acted as a political tool serving the most extreme elements working to undermine peace, security, and stability in the Middle East.”
“From an ethical perspective, this is a moral aberration that turns good into evil and serves the forces of evil,” he said. “From a diplomatic perspective, issuing orders against a country acting according to international law is a reward and encouragement for the axis of evil (of Iran-led groups), which flagrantly and consistently violates it.”
Far-right Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir condemned the ICC as “antisemitic from start to finish,” adding that Israel should respond by “applying sovereignty” to the occupied West Bank and building Jewish settlements in all the territories under Israel’s control.
Gallant served as defense minister until this month, when Netanyahu fired him after months of clashes over domestic politics and Israel’s war effort. The prime minister said at the time that “trust between me and the minister of defense has cracked.” Israel Katz, who served as foreign minister until then, became defense minister.
What happens next?
Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, described the ICC’s decision as “the most dramatic legal development in Israel’s history.”
“Its immediate meaning is that the 124 state parties to the ICC, which include most of Israel’s closest allies, would be legally obligated to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant should they be present in their territories,” Lieblich told CNN.
There may also be wider implications, he added, which “could limit the ability of third parties to cooperate with” the Israeli military.
After an arrest warrant has been issued, the ICC sends requests for cooperation to member states. The court does not have a police force of its own to make the arrests, but relies on member states to execute them, which state parties are legally obliged to do.
Previous leaders who have been faced with ICC arrest warrants have experienced limitations on their ability to travel, unable to pass through countries legally obliged to arrest them.
ICC judges have issued 56 arrest warrants, resulting in 21 detentions and appearances before the court. Another 27 people remain at large and charges have been dropped against 7 people due to their deaths.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/middleeast/israel-gaza-strikes-kills-dozens-death-toll-climbs-intl/index.html,"Israeli airstrikes kill at least 87 in northern and central Gaza as war death toll surpasses 44,000",2024-11-21 14:36:33,"Israeli strikes on northern and central Gaza killed at least 87 Palestinians in 24 hours, local health authorities said, as the death toll in the enclave surpassed 44,000.
At least 65 people were killed in Israeli strikes on northern Gaza overnight, a medical official in the enclave told CNN on Thursday, adding that the toll expected to rise.
Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, told CNN on Thursday morning that casualties were still being brought to the hospital.
In an interview with Hamas’ Al-Aqsa TV, he said about 200 people were believed to have been at the site when the Israeli military struck.
“The hospital medical team retrieved 65 martyrs from under the rubble,” Abu Safiya said, adding that medical staff were recovering bodies from under the rubble “using their hands” due to the absence of rescue teams.
Safiya warned that the hospital “will turn into a mass grave if urgent intervention from international organizations does not occur and medical supplies are not brought in,” adding that “not a single ambulance” was available in northern Gaza.
In a separate strike on Wednesday, at least 22 people were killed, including 10 children, north of Gaza City in the center of the enclave, according to Dr. Muneer Alboursh, director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
The airstrike hit a family home in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, Alboursh said in a statement on Thursday.
Gaza’s civil defense said that rescue teams were working to recover people from the rubble and that the death toll was expected to rise.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on both strikes.
The strikes come as the death toll in Gaza climbs after Israel’s renewed offensive in the north of the territory.
At least 44,056 people have been killed and more than 104,000 injured in the enclave since the war began last year, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza.
Meanwhile in Lebanon, Israel launched airstrikes on the southern suburb of Beirut early Thursday, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA). The strikes were accompanied by low-altitude flights of hostile drones over the area, NNA said.
The airstrikes, targeting the Hezbollah stronghold of Haret Hreik, destroyed several buildings, NNA said.
Earlier on Thursday, Avichay Adraee, the Israel military’s spokesperson to Arabic media, posted evacuation warnings on X mapping three buildings in the area Haret Hreik, saying they were potential targets. He issued a similar evacuation warning for seven buildings in the historic southern city of Tyre.
Israel’s strikes came as US envoy Amos Hochstein engages in ceasefire negotiations between Lebanon and Israel. He arrived in Israel on Wednesday.","['Abeer Salman', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Eyad Kourdi']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/politics/senate-vote-arms-sales-to-israel/index.html,Senate defeats effort led by Bernie Sanders to block planned US arms sales to Israel,2024-11-13 00:00:00,"The Senate on Wednesday voted down an effort led by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders to block a series of planned US weapons sales to Israel.
The failure of the long-shot effort highlights that despite criticism from the left that the Biden administration and Israel are not doing enough to protect civilians in Gaza, there remains widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for US military assistance to Israel.
The Senate votes come as scrutiny over US support for Israel’s war against Hamas has intensified as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has grown worse amid Israel’s ongoing military campaign. The US is Israel’s biggest military supplier.
The war, which was triggered by Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terror attack, has raged for more than a year, killing at least 43,000 people, according to the Gazan health ministry. Efforts to secure a ceasefire and release of the Israel hostages held by Hamas have floundered, but there is more optimism about securing an end to the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
“What is happening in Gaza today is unspeakable,” Sanders said at a press conference Tuesday on Capitol Hill. “What makes it even more painful is that much of what is happening there has been done with US weapons and with American taxpayer support. The United States of America is complicit in these atrocities. That complicity must end and that is what these resolutions are about.”
Sanders, who is Jewish, said that “Israel clearly had a right to respond to the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7,” but criticized the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
The White House actively lobbied against the effort to block the arms sales.
“We strongly oppose this resolution and we have made our position clear to interested Senators,” a White House National Security Council spokesperson told CNN in a statement.
The Senate votes highlighted an issue that has provoked contentious debate within the Democratic Party. But the effort was unable to advance in the waning days of the Biden administration and the current Senate Democratic majority.
President-elect Donald Trump, who returns to the White House in January, has already announced a strong defender of Israel as his pick for US ambassador to Israel – former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who once argued that there was “no such thing as a Palestinian.” The House and Senate will also be in Republican hands starting in January, giving Trump a GOP government trifecta to carry out his agenda.
Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell urged his colleagues not to support the resolutions ahead of the votes.
“Those who mourn senseless human suffering should have no trouble assigning blame to the terrorists who exploit civilians, schools, hospitals and mosques as cover,” he said in Senate floor remarks on Tuesday. “I hope the Senate will reject the senator’s resolutions outright.”
The Senate failed to advance three separate measures – known as resolutions of disapproval – aimed at halting certain arms sales announced by the Biden administration in August.
A resolution to block a sale of tank rounds was rejected by a vote of 18 to 79. A second resolution to block a sale of high-explosive mortar rounds was rejected by a vote of 19 to 78, and a third resolution to block a sale of joint direct attack munitions, otherwise known as JDAMS, was rejected by a vote of 17 to 80.
The resolutions were backed by a group of independent and Democratic senators.
“The sales of JDAMS and 120mm tank rounds are particularly concerning, given their indiscriminate use in Gaza,” a fact sheet released by Sanders’ office stated. “These systems account for many of the 40,534 deaths and nearly 94,000 injuries in Gaza so far – 60 percent of whom are women, children, or elderly people. Reliable human rights monitors have documented numerous incidents involving these systems leading to unacceptable civilian death and harm.”
CNN and others have reported on Israel’s use of US-made munitions, including JDAMS, in incidents that killed dozens of Palestinians.
Pro-Palestinian advocacy groups argued that the Senate votes were significant despite their failure and marked a shift for the Democratic Party.
“Today’s first-ever vote to block weapons to Israel, through the leadership of Sen. Bernie Sanders, shows Democrats are starting to learn the lessons of this election and beginning to listen to their own voters,” Hamid Bendaas, a spokesperson for the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project, a pro-Palestinian advocacy group, said in a statement.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/middleeast/us-envoy-beirut-lebanon-israel-ceasefire-talks-intl/index.html,US envoy heads to Beirut as Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire talks gain momentum,2024-03-04 00:00:00,"United States envoy Amos Hochstein is expected in Beirut on Tuesday, according to two Lebanese official sources, in what is seen as a sign of progress in ceasefire negotiations for the deadly cross-border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The news comes after Beirut responded “positively” to a US-backed proposal to stop the Israel-Hezbollah war, per Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Makati. Speaking to Al Araby TV news channel on Monday, Makati said the Lebanese government had been seeking clarification on some “unclear points” in the ceasefire proposal, but that large parts of the draft agreement were resolved.
Certain points would “clarification” through a “face to face” discussions with Hochstein, he added.
US ambassador to Lebanon Lisa Johnson relayed the proposal to the Lebanese government via Nabih Berri, the parliament speaker, on Thursday night, a Lebanese official told CNN earlier.
According to the official, Hezbollah reviewed the proposal and submitted their response to Lebanese authorities on Sunday evening. The source described the response as largely “positive.”
A source familiar with the situation told CNN that the negotiations on a diplomatic resolution are continuing and noted that Hochstein’s trip does not necessarily signal that a deal is imminent.
What’s in the ceasefire proposal
The US-backed proposal aims to achieve a 60-day cessation of hostilities and is being portrayed as the basis of a lasting ceasefire, according to the Lebanese official, adding that terms lie within the parameters of UN Resolution 1701 which ended the Lebanon-Israel war of 2006. The resolution stipulates that the only armed groups in the area south of Lebanon’s Litani River should be the Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping forces.
The proposal also requires Israeli ground forces, operating in southern Lebanon since late September, to withdraw from the country and demands a stricter enforcement of resolution 1701, according to the Lebanese official.
Both Israel and Lebanon have “reacted” to the proposal, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday.
“We have been sharing proposals, both with the Government of Lebanon and the Government of Israel. Both sides have reacted to the proposals that we have put forward,” he said at a press briefing.
Miller would not say if the US is optimistic about the prospects of reaching an agreement, but noted that “when you have a resolution in the interest of all the relevant parties, we ought to be able to get to an agreement, and that’s what we’re going to try to do.”
“We’re going to continue to stay at that process, because we believe a diplomatic resolution is key to allowing the fighting to stop, to protecting civilians and allowing the civilians in both Israel and Lebanon to return to their homes,” said Miller.
Israeli ‘operational freedom’
An Israeli source familiar with the talks however cast doubt on the likelihood of an imminent deal, noting that while progress has been made, Hezbollah’s refusal to accept Israel’s demand for the right to strike Hezbollah targets in the event of a ceasefire violation could jeopardize the process. Without this clause, the source added, it is uncertain whether Netanyahu can secure cabinet approval for the agreement.
The Israeli source added that Hochstein has not yet confirmed when he will arrive in the region.
Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right Israeli minister of finance, said on Monday that “full operational freedom” for the Israeli military in southern Lebanon is “a non-negotiable condition.”
“At the end of the war, we will have operational freedom in Gaza, and so we will also have operational freedom in Lebanon. We will not agree to any arrangement that is not worth the paper it is written on,” he said. “We are changing the security paradigm and will not return to decades of concepts of containment and threats without response. This will not happen again.”
In his interview with Al Araby TV, Mikati dismissed reports of demands to give the Israeli military operational freedom in south Lebanon as “speculation,” adding that he hasn’t seen such a clause in the proposal.
Berri, who leads the Hezbollah-allied Amal party and is an interlocutor in the talks, told Saudi-owned Asharq Al Awsat newspaper on Friday that the proposal he received from the US does not include mention of Israeli military operational freedom in Lebanon, adding that the US knows that such a demand would be “unacceptable.”
The Lebanese official who spoke to CNN also said the proposal does not refer to Israel’s right to continue striking Lebanon after a truce.
The source also said Hezbollah has agreed to separate its conflict with Israel from Israel’s war in Gaza. Prior to Israel’s all-out offensive in late September, the militant group had insisted it would only cease near-daily attacks on Israel’s northern-most territories once a ceasefire was achieved in Gaza.
According to multiple high-level Lebanese officials, Hezbollah had initially agreed to delink the two conflicts the night before its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September.
Mikati said that his government is in contact with US President-elect Donald Trump’s team.
Another Lebanese source familiar with the ceasefire talks told CNN earlier that President-elect Trump has endorsed Hochstein’s ceasefire negotiations track, increasing the chances of its success.
Israel is ‘ready to do’ a deal
Meanwhile, a senior US official told CNN that there is “no stock” in reports that Israel will try to delay a deal. “The Israelis have confirmed to us they’re ready to do it,” the source said.
A deal with Hezbollah would “send a signal to Hamas” that Israel and its partners will do their utmost to secure a deal that brings back hostages held in Gaza, the US official said.
“If we have a Lebanon deal, we’re going to come down like a ton of bricks on Hamas to try to get a hostage deal,” the official said, adding that Israel needs “to turn this military success… into a strategic success.”
The US official said that the region was in a deadlock as Hamas refused to strike a ceasefire deal that returns Israeli hostages, and Hezbollah had vowed to keep fighting until Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza came to an end.
While the US is not privy to all of Israel’s military plans, the official said, “having the degradation of Hezbollah helps” to strike an agreement.
“To get a deal in Lebanon, Hezbollah has to be put under pressure,” the US official said, adding that “Hezbollah cannot rebuild its massive military infrastructure” across the border with Israel.","['Tamara Qiblawi', 'Becky Anderson', 'Dana Karni', 'Jennifer Hansler']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/middleeast/pope-israel-gaza-genocide-allegations-intl/index.html,Pope Francis calls for investigation into Gaza genocide allegations,2024-11-18 13:58:29,"Pope Francis has said that allegations of a genocide in Gaza should be “carefully investigated” marking some of his strongest criticism yet of Israel’s war with Hamas.
“According to some experts… what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,” Vatican News, the Holy See’s official news outlet, cited the pontiff as writing in a forthcoming book. “It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.”
Speaking of refugees, the pope said: “I am thinking above all of those who leave Gaza in the midst of the famine that has struck their Palestinian brothers and sisters given the difficulty of getting food and aid into their territory,” according to Vatican News.
With few exceptions, most Gazans have been prevented from leaving the territory since the war began, but almost the entire population of more than 2 million has been internally displaced.
The excerpts are from the book “Hope never disappoints: Pilgrims towards a better world,” which is due to be released on November 19.
Responding to the report in Vatican News, Yaron Sideman, Israeli ambassador to the Holy See, said “there was a genocidal massacre on 7 October 2023 of Israeli citizens,” referring to the Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw another 250 taken hostage.
“Since then, Israel has exercised its right of self-defense against attempts from seven different fronts to kill its citizens,” Sideman wrote on X. “Any attempt to call it by any other name is singling out the Jewish state.”
The 87-year-old pontiff is the latest among a growing number of international figures and organizations to refer to Israel’s military operation in Gaza as a potential genocide.
Israel is facing a case brought by South Africa at the United Nations’ International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which Pretoria accuses the Jewish state of genocide, saying Israeli leadership is “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza.”
Israel earlier this year rejected what it called the “grossly distorted” accusation of genocide leveled against it by South Africa, arguing at the ICJ that its war is being fought in self-defense against Hamas, and that it was targeting the militant group rather than Palestinians as a whole.
A UN Special Committee report released Thursday said Israel’s war conduct in Gaza “is consistent with the characteristics of genocide,” including mass civilian casualties and using starvation as a weapon.
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last week accused Israel of carrying out genocide in Gaza, in some of his strongest criticism of the country since the war began last year. The Gulf Arab state was close to normalizing relations with Israel before the October 7 war.
Pope Francis rarely comments on politics, often limiting his remarks to calls for peace. In March, he repeated his call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in his traditional Easter message at the Vatican, condemning war as an “absurdity.”
He pleaded for an “immediate ceasefire,” access to humanitarian aid in Gaza and the “prompt release of the hostages.”
In December 2023, the pope addressed the deaths of two women killed by an Israeli sniper inside the Holy Family Parish in Gaza. He lamented that “unarmed civilians are targets for bombs and gunfire” in Gaza and invoking scripture on war.
Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, the ministry of health there says, and has flattened large swathes of the territory, triggering a humanitarian crisis.
On Monday, at least 50 people were killed in Gaza, according to the health ministry there, including 17 members of a family in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, where the Israeli military said it has been operating “against terrorist infrastructure and operatives” over the past week.",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

The administration has issued a number of rounds of sanctions after President Joe Biden issued an executive order in February allowing sanctions on those undermining “peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.” The latest action comes amid a push from Democrats for Biden to act in his final months in office to impose sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers – Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – for their roles in inciting settler violence in the West Bank and as frustration grows from within Biden’s own party about his administration’s seeming unwillingness to penalize the Israeli government.
President-elect Donald Trump is unlikely to take any punitive actions against Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank – instead, his policies are likely to embrace them. His pick for US Ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, is staunchly pro-Israel and has voiced support for Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territory.
The sanctions from the US Treasury Department Monday hit Amana, “the largest organization involved in settlement and illegal outpost development in the West Bank” that has “established dozens of illegal settler outposts and directly engaged in dispossession of private land owned by Palestinians in its support of settlers,” according to the State Department.
The organization “maintains ties to various persons previously sanctioned by the U.S. government and its partners for perpetrating violence in the West Bank,” the Treasury Department said in a press release. The Treasury Department also sanctioned Amana’s subsidiary Binyanei Bar Amana Ltd., “a construction and development company that builds and sells homes in settlements and outposts in the West Bank.”
In a concurrent action, the US State Department imposed sanctions on three companies and three people “for their roles in violence targeting civilians or in the destruction or dispossession of property.”
A group of nearly 90 congressional Democrats urged Biden in a late October letter to impose sanctions on Smotrich and Ben Gvir. They publicly released the letter last week in order to increase pressure on the administration.
The letter had also pushed for sanctions on Amana, which was sanctioned Monday.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/17/middleeast/israel-beirut-gaza-airstrikes-intl/index.html,Israeli strike kills Hezbollah spokesperson Mohammed Afif as group prepares response to fresh ceasefire proposal,2024-11-17 12:03:20,"The spokesperson of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, Mohammed Afif, was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut on Sunday.
The death of Afif, who was for years an adviser to the late Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and had been responsible for the group’s media relations since 2014, was confirmed by the militant group in a statement calling him a “great media leader.”
Afif was at the headquarters of the pro-Hezbollah Baath Party at the time of the strike.
No evacuation warning was issued before the strike, which hit an area known as Ras al-Nabaa in the middle of the day, killing four people, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a “precise, intelligence-based strike” that “eliminated the terrorist Mohammed Afif, the chief propagandist and spokesperson of the Hezbollah terrorist organization.”
Among those paying tribute to Afif was the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which sent its condolences to Afif’s family and Hezbollah leadership, calling him “a strong and defiant voice of resistance.”
On Sunday evening, another strike hit a building in Mar Elias, a densely populated Sunni-majority neighborhood near central Beirut, killing at least two people according to the Lebanese health ministry. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the strike.
With Sunday’s attacks, five strikes have hit inside Beirut’s city limits since 2006, when a 34-day armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah took place.
Afif was one of the few public faces of Hezbollah, following a massive Israeli infiltration operation drove the group deep underground.
He often delivered speeches from news conferences amid the rubble in the southern suburbs of Beirut, which have been pounded by attacks since Israel began a new offensive on October 1.
Hezbollah is currently reviewing a US-Israeli ceasefire proposal submitted to the Lebanese government on Thursday, according to CNN sources familiar with the negotiations. It is unclear whether Afif’s reported killing will impact the negotiations.
Israel’s targeting of Afif comes amid an escalation in its offensive in Lebanon. Last week, Israel’s defense minister Israel Katz announced the expansion of the ground operation in southern Lebanon.
And on Sunday Israel said it was using artillery batteries inside Lebanese territory for the first time. Previously, batteries had remained on Israeli soil firing into villages across the border.
Artillery batteries are carrying out shelling from inside Lebanese territory “attacking targets in support of ground forces during their operations,” Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesperson, said Sunday. The aim, Adraee said, is to “expand the scope of the shelling” and “direct heavy fire towards” combat areas in support of ground maneuvers.
Israel’s war on many fronts
In northern Gaza, at least 50 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Beit Lahiya on Sunday morning, according to the enclave’s health ministry.
Dozens of Palestinians displaced by the ongoing Israeli operation in the nearby Jabalya area were sheltering in two of the houses hit, a local journalist said.
“We were sitting at home and suddenly we heard intense strikes, because of this we were not able to leave the house,” one eyewitness, who is also a resident of the area, told CNN without giving his name.
The resident said the people in the area started removing the dead from the rubble in the absence of civil defense and ambulances. Gaza’s civil defense say they are unable to operate in the area due to the continuing Israeli strikes.
“These were people displaced from Jabalya to Beit Lahiya,” the eyewitness said.
A video of the aftermath seen by CNN shows children panicking, with some crying in the background, as a man tells them to calm down and get out. A toddler, covered in blood, is being held in someone’s arms.
Another toddler is heard in the background crying, “mama, mama.”
The IDF told CNN that “several strikes were conducted on terrorist targets” in the area of Beit Lahiya overnight. It said that there have been “continuous efforts to evacuate the civilian population from the active war zone in the area” and that “IDF is precisely operating and is doing everything possible to avoid causing harm to civilians.”
Separately, Israeli strikes targeted al-Bureij in central Gaza killing 23 people, according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were taken. CNN has also reached out to the IDF for comment on those strikes.
“It was a very terrifying night, with the sounds of small children screaming — every little one calling for their mother,” one resident in the area, Mahmoud Azaiza, said.
When asked about the Al-Bureij strike, the IDF told CNN it is “operating to dismantle Hamas military capabilities.”
Israel launched a renewed military offensive on Jabalya last month after Israeli intelligence indicated that Hamas was trying to rebuild its capabilities in the area. The offensive displaced thousands of Palestinians and killed dozens.
The operation has inflicted losses on the Israeli military, with 20 soldiers declared to have been killed in northern Gaza since the operation began, including four last week, according to statements published by the IDF since October 6.
“This operation to systematically dismantle terrorist infrastructure in the area will continue as long as required in order to achieve its objectives,” the IDF said last month.
The continued offensive on Gaza coincides with Israel’s expanding operation in southern Lebanon. On Friday night, Israeli forces reached the village of Chama, some 61 miles from the capital of Beirut, in what is understood to be the deepest incursion into southern Lebanese territory.
Israeli forces withdrew after clashing with Hezbollah, Lebanese state media said.
Lebanon’s health ministry also reported that Israeli airstrikes on villages in the southern Tyre district on Sunday killed at least 11 people. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
Israeli airstrikes continued pounding the Lebanese capital on Sunday for the sixth consecutive day. The IDF renewed evacuation warnings Sunday morning for residents of Haret Hreik in the southern Beirut suburbs, where Hezbollah is known to have a strong presence. The Israeli military said its air force had conducted strikes on six Hezbollah military targets in Beirut’s southern outskirts, known as Dahiyeh.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/16/politics/pro-palestine-activists-trump-democrats/index.html,Pro-Palestinian activists’ anger at Democrats hasn’t been dampened by Trump’s election,2024-11-16 17:00:47,"For Democratic pro-Palestinian activists, Donald Trump’s reelection delivered a bitter vindication.
Led by the Uncommitted National Movement, they spent months pushing and pleading with the Biden administration to scale back its support for Israel’s war in Gaza. Their warning had been consistent and direct: Not only did Democrats risk collapsing support among Arab American and Muslim voters in Michigan, but the conflict – and the continuous flow of military aid to the Israeli government – could depress enthusiasm among the coalition of young, mostly progressive-minded voters who proved key to Joe Biden’s victory in 2020.
“We told them that the impact of Gaza was going be bigger than just the Arab community. It’s why the turnout was lower in college areas and among young Black voters,” said James Zogby, co-founder of the Arab American Institute and a Democratic National Committee member for more than 30 years. “From the polling we’ve been doing over the last year, we saw it had an impact. And it certainly had an impact on my community.”
Early post-election analysis of the race suggests that those concerns were well-founded – and emblematic of a broader disconnect between party leaders and the Democratic grassroots. Arab Americans, like Latino and Black men, all moved toward Trump in the final accounting. The president-elect’s vote-share improved nearly everywhere, from the red states he’s dominated for nearly a decade to traditionally liberal electorates, where Democrats either stayed home or, to a lesser degree, backed third-party candidates.
“While Kamala Harris was ignoring communities, especially of Muslim Arab communities here in Dearborn,” Uncommitted co-founder Lexis Zeidan told CNN, Trump “was coming to these communities and pandering to these communities, and he was capitalizing off of these vulnerable emotions and telling them what they wanted to hear.”
Dearborn, Michigan, is home to the country’s largest Arab American population. As the results came the night of the election, its shift away from the top of the Democratic ticket startled even some of the most passionate activists.
Four years after Biden dominated there, Trump got 42% of the vote, a plurality. Green Party nominee Jill Stein nearly cracked 20%. Harris landed in the middle, with 36%. According to national exit polls, more than 6 in 10 Muslims voted for the Democrat – a clear majority, but a stark decline from past cycles.
Zeidan and other allies in the movement also pointed to Harris’ letdowns with other minority voters that had traditional broken strongly for Democrats.
“This (election) wasn’t a referendum on Gaza policy,” Zeidan said. “What (the national results) showed you is that she not only was sidelining ‘uncommitted’ and Arab and Muslim voters, but she was sidelining other communities of color as well – working class, climate justice, the Latina and Latino community.”
Wa’el Alzayat, CEO of the Muslim American advocacy organization Emgage, guessed that Harris’ Muslim support might have come in as high as 90% if she had clearly signaled plans to break from Biden’s policy in the region. Emgage ultimately endorsed Harris, despite some of its members’ misgivings, arguing that “pursuing an anti-war agenda had a better shot under (the Democrat’s) administration.”
Trump’s initial planned appointments, Alzayat said, confirmed his anxieties.
“What kind of peace and freedom for the Palestinians are we going have under Mike Huckabee and Tulsi Gabbard? My God. And Matt Gaetz. What kind of rights are pro-Palestinian students going to have?” he said, naming Trump’s controversial picks for ambassador to Israel, national intelligence director and attorney general, respectively.
That fear and frustration, though, has not translated to guilt. Activists and voters who spoke to CNN over the past three days unanimously rejected any suggestion that their work was to blame for Harris’ unraveling.
“I don’t have any regrets,” Uncommitted spokesman and strategist Waleed Shahid told CNN. “We tried our best to bridge the campaign and the party with the community. Tried to help the campaign help themselves by changing their policy position and doing something that was in the mutual self-interest of the community and the party.”
“And they rejected those offers pretty plainly.”
Uncommitted most memorably led a push at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this summer to allow a Palestinian-American speaker to address the party. After weeks of back-and-forth, on the final night of the confab, party officials inside the United Center told Uncommitted leaders it was a no-go.
Michigan Democrats, led by the state party chair Lavora Barnes, objected immediately – first in a brief interview with CNN, then in a statement to reporters.
“The thing I’ve been saying and I will always say is that these uncommitted voters are our voters, they’re our family,” Barnes told CNN at the time. “They are good Democrats who have an issue that they want to voice, and they have every right to voice it.”
United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain, another prominent Michigan-based leader, also condemned the decision, accusing the party of putting “our heads in the sand” and ignoring the festering anger.
Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romman would have been the one to speak that night, had convention organizers allowed it. Romman said she had even watered down her remarks in a bid to ease the transaction. She did, in the end, deliver her speech – to a group of Uncommitted leaders and allies who began a sit-in outside the convention.
Months later, Romman, who was reelected to her statehouse seat last week, told CNN she has only become more troubled by the Harris campaign’s refusal, as she saw it, to acknowledge the depth of suffering among Palestinian- and Lebanese-American emigrees, long stalwarts of the Democratic coalition.
“If you needed our votes to save you, you should have acted like it,” Romman said of Democrats now wagging their fingers at the Arab American community. “Yes, Trump is way worse. Am I happy that he’s an office? No, I’m terrified and I did all that I could to prevent that.”
Uncommitted didn’t officially endorse either candidate, but Romman voted for Harris. Shahid and co-founder Abbas Alawieh both urged others to do the same.
In Dearborn, Arab American voters speaking to CNN expressed frustration with Trump’s early moves, but insisted they were not anguishing over their votes.
“I feel good that I don’t have blood on my hands,” said Dalal Baydoun, who voted for Stein. “Because like I said, they’re all with genocide, so having to not be a part of all that makes me feel good.”
The global debate over how to describe or define Israel’s actions in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and, increasingly, in Lebanon, has often overshadowed the less complicated reality on the ground here, where the opposition is diverse, organized and angry.
A United Nations report out Friday said Israel’s offensive in Gaza “is consistent with the characteristics of genocide,” citing mass civilian casualties and using starvation as a weapon. An onslaught that began as a reprisal against Hamas following the terror group’s October 7, 2023, rampage in southern Israel, has, from the perspective of international observers, become a global scandal.
Last week, the UN Human Rights Office said it “found close to 70 per cent to be children and women, indicating a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law” on the part of the Israeli military.
That report landed at about the same time Biden’s Departments of State and Defense said – after a weeks-long review – that they could not “verify” whether Israel used American-made weapons in violation of international humanitarian law.
Close watchers of Harris’ rhetoric during the campaign sniffed out a subtle shift during her final days on the stump in Michigan. Her talk about ending the war in Gaza had become more robust.
“This year has been difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon, it is devastating,” Harris said during an late rally in East Lansing, home to Michigan State University. “And as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, security and self-determination.”
Activists were hopeful, they said, but worried that it was still too little – and coming way too late in the campaign. Former President Bill Clinton had already deepened the wounds, calling Gaza the “hardest issue here,” before effectively arguing Israel’s actions in Gaza were, if not justified, then understandable given Hamas’ tactics.
“I understand why young Palestinian and Arab Americans in Michigan think too many people have died, I get that,” Clinton said. “But if you lived in one of those kibbutzim in Israel, right next to Gaza, where the people there were the most pro-friendship with Palestine, most pro-two state solution of any of the Israeli communities, were the ones right next to Gaza. And Hamas butchered them.”
Clinton’s remarks were the capper, multiple operatives told CNN, on a campaign that seemed unable – or unwilling – to see how its broader strategy of trying to lure moderate Republicans by embracing former Rep. Liz Cheney and her father, Iraq War architect and former Vice President Dick Cheney, was further undermining its case with Arab Americans.
“If there’s one person Muslims and Arabs hate more, or about the same as Donald Trump,” Shahid said, “it’s probably Dick Cheney.”
Zogby, who said he is now planning to run for a vice chair slot on the Democratic National Committee, also questioned the campaign’s decision to lean on Liz Cheney, describing it as a slap in the face to Arab Americans.
Still, Zogby added, for all the missteps and slights, he is “not happy with my community” – and said Trump’s early round of policy and personnel moves predicted darker days to come.
“There’s going to be a reckoning for this,” he said of Arab American support for Trump. “Those who said, we’re going teach Democrats a lesson, or maybe Trump’s better in a second term, well, they’re already getting their reckoning, and he’s not even started this term.”

The US ambassador to Lebanon, Lisa Johnson, relayed the proposal to the Lebanese government on Thursday night, a Lebanese official familiar with the discussions told CNN.
Authorities are “optimistic” that Hezbollah will agree to the terms of the agreement and expect to submit an official response to the latest proposal next Monday, the official said.
“Diplomatic efforts are on fire now,” the source said.
On Saturday evening, another Lebanese source told CNN extensive discussions were taking place in Beirut among political officials regarding the American initiative.
Israel launched a major offensive in Lebanon in mid-September following months of tit-for-tat border attacks which started when Hezbollah attacked Israel in solidarity with Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. Returning 60,000 civilians to their homes in northern Israel has become a political imperative for the country’s leadership.
The offensive dealt devastating blows to Hezbollah’s leadership and its vast arsenal, and, according to the Lebanese health ministry, killed hundreds of civilians and displaced more than a million people.
Even with ceasefire talks underway, Israeli strikes have escalated this week, intensifying its bombardment and ground operation. Most of the targets have been Shia-majority areas where Hezbollah wields influence, but Israel has also struck buildings housing displaced families well outside areas of the militant group’s dominance.
Israel’s strikes across Lebanon killed at least 43 people on Thursday, including eight civil defense workers, according to Lebanon’s health ministry and civil defense directorate.
The General Directorate of the Civil Defense said on X that an Israeli strike destroyed their headquarters in the village of Douris near Baalbek. The civil defense building was hit “while a number of workers were inside, ready to receive calls for relief and immediate intervention to assist citizens,” the directorate said in a statement.
The latest proposal, which Ambassador Johnson outlined to Lebanon’s Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri – who is close to Hezbollah – is the first to be submitted by the US and Israel since a temporary ceasefire was negotiated in late September. Those efforts were upended when Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a major bombing attack in Beirut’s southern suburbs.
Another Lebanese official familiar with the discussions around the ceasefire told CNN that US President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed the ongoing negotiations, which have been spearheaded by the Biden administration’s special envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein.
Sticking points
US officials have continued to pursue a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and people close to Donald Trump have signaled to administration officials that he would not seek to upend the ongoing efforts, US and Israeli sources said.
Still there are questions about when the deal gets finished: current US official say it is close to being concluded, but some Israeli officials have told Trump and those close to him that they intend to deliver the incoming Trump team with the ceasefire as an early gift. Other Israeli officials, however, have signaled to the Biden administration that they want to move ahead with a deal sooner rather than later.
CNN has approached the Trump campaign for comment.
The Logan Act prevents Trump – before he is officially president – from engaging in US policy, and specifically from negotiating with foreign governments which have disputes with the US. Members of Trump’s transition team are cognizant of this law.
Still some current US officials point out that Trump likely does not want to be seen as putting pressure on Israel so soon after he takes office, so there is a mutual incentive to resolve the situation on Israel’s northern border sooner rather than later. Two people involved in the discussions said the main sticking point still being how to enforce a Hezbollah retreat from southern Lebanon and whether the Lebanese Armed Forces will be prepared to take on a more active role there.
The US-Israeli proposal aims to achieve a 60-day cessation of hostilities and is being portrayed as the basis of a lasting ceasefire, according to the first Lebanese official, adding that terms lie within the parameters of UN Resolution 1701 which ended the Lebanon-Israel war of 2006. The resolution stipulates that the only armed groups in the area south of Lebanon’s Litani River should be the Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping forces.
The proposal also involves Israeli ground forces, operating in south Lebanon since late September, retreat to behind the internationally recognized boundary between the two countries.
“The points mainly focus on the mechanism of implementation and on the role of the Lebanese Armed Forces in implementing 1701in the south of the Litani River,” the official said, adding that it also deals with smuggling routes through the country’s international borders.

On Friday night, Israeli forces reached the village of Chama, some 61 miles from the capital of Beirut, known for its shrine to Saint Peter, referred to in Arabic as the prophet Shimon Al-Safa.
After reaching the area, Israeli troops managed to blow up the shrine, which lies on the village’s main hill, according to reporting from Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA). CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the report.
A video obtained by Lebanese news outlet Al-Akhbar and verified by CNN showed smoke rising from the complex housing the shrine, which has traditionally been a popular pilgrimage site for Shiite Muslims.
A nearby UN peacekeeping position was also hit by an artillery shell from the strikes, according to the NNA report.
Meanwhile, intense Israeli strikes targeted areas of Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday, marking the fifth straight day of Israeli attacks on the Dayiyeh region of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. NNA said three areas were hit.
Large plumes of smoke were rising from the heavily damaged buildings, according to videos geolocated by CNN. It remains unclear if there were casualties from the strikes.
The Israel Defense Forces said it had targeted Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure, accusing the Iran-backed group of embedding itself within the civilian population. It issued evacuation orders across several locations ahead of the attacks.
Israel has intensified its strikes on the capital and expanded its ground operation in southern Lebanon in recent days. The heavy strikes coincide with revived negotiations for a ceasefire in Lebanon.
The US ambassador to Lebanon, Lisa Johnson, relayed a new US-Israeli ceasefire proposal to the Lebanese government on Thursday night, a Lebanese official familiar with the discussions told CNN.
The latest proposal is the first to be submitted by the US and Israel since a temporary ceasefire was negotiated in late September. Those efforts were upended when Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a major bombing attack in Beirut’s southern suburbs.
Authorities are ‘optimistic’ that Hezbollah will agree to the terms of the agreement. The government expects to submit an official response on next Monday, the official said.
It remains unclear if the intensified strikes across Lebanon will influence the ceasefire negotiations. On Thursday alone, Israeli airstrikes resulted in the deaths of at least 59 individuals throughout Lebanon, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health.
Most of the strikes have been in Shia-majority areas where Hezbollah wields influence, but Israel has also struck buildings housing displaced families well outside areas of the militant group’s dominance.
Meanwhile Hezbollah has continued systematically firing projectiles onto areas in northern Israel. At least 60 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israel on Saturday, the IDF said.

The strikes targeted several residential buildings in the upscale Mezzah neighborhood in the capital and the Qudsaya area in the Damascus countryside, Syrian state media reported. Among those killed were women and children, Syrian state media added.
The Israeli military said in a statement it was striking Islamic Jihad in Syria earlier Thursday and had “inflicted significant damage to the terrorist organization’s command center and to its operatives.” Islamic Jihad is the second-largest militant group in Gaza.
Syrian state media said: “The Israeli enemy launched an aerial attack from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting several residential buildings in the Mezzah neighborhood of Damascus and the Qudsaya area in the Damascus countryside.
“This resulted in the martyrdom of fifteen people and the injury of sixteen others, including women and children, as an initial toll, along with significant material damage to private property and the targeted and neighboring buildings,” Syrian state media said.
Islamic Jihad said the strike killed “a group” of its members in a statement Thursday, but did not specify how many were killed.
The group denied Israel’s claims that the strike “targeted military headquarters and centers belonging to the movement,” and instead said the strike hit civilian institutions and residential homes.
Syria’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes on Thursday, calling them “brutal crimes,” SANA reported.
The statement outlined that the attacks on Syria came just two days after the Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh issued a “broad condemnation of (Israel’s) brutal and escalating aggression on Syrian territory,” according to SANA.
The latest assault come after Israeli airstrikes intensified in Syria over the weekend, killing at least seven civilians and leaving 20 injured, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.
The strikes targeted a residential building in the Sayyidah Zaynab area of the Damascus countryside, with women and children among those killed, SANA said.
The Sayyidah Zaynab area, south of Damascus city, is known to have a Hezbollah presence and has come under attack from Israel in recent weeks. On November 4, SANA reported Israeli strikes in Sayyidah Zaynab the same day the IDF said Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck Hezbollah intelligence infrastructure in the Damascus area.
On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it struck “smuggling routes” between Lebanon and Syria, that it alleges were used to transfer weapons to Hezbollah.
The Syrian defense ministry said on Wednesday an Israeli strike targeted bridges on the Syria-Lebanon border in the Qusayr area of Homs countryside in western Syria, causing “significant damage.”

“Through its siege over Gaza, obstruction of humanitarian aid, alongside targeted attacks and killing of civilians and aid workers, despite repeated UN appeals, binding orders from the International Court of Justice and resolutions of the Security Council, Israel is intentionally causing death, starvation and serious injury, using starvation as a method of war and inflicting collective punishment on the Palestinian population,” the UN committee said in a press release.
“The Israeli military’s use of AI-assisted targeting, with minimal human oversight, combined with heavy bombs, underscores Israel’s disregard of its obligation to distinguish between civilians and combatants and take adequate safeguards to prevent civilian deaths,” the committee said.
The UN committee added that Israeli officials have publicly supported policies to destroy “vital water, sanitation and food systems” in Gaza as well as prevent access to fuel.
COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza, responded on Saturday in statement that said Israel “does not use hunger as a weapon of war.”
The Israeli agency said the quantity of food trucks entering the Gaza Strip has “risen sharply and significantly” and Israel is “exerting enormous efforts” to facilitate the entry of aid into Gaza with “no limit on quantity.” The agency added that the UN’s work in collecting and distributing the aid to residents the enclave is “neither steady nor effective.”
“Despite the repeated claims of the international community, which sometimes do not fully reflect the situation in the Gaza Strip and the humanitarian efforts there, the State of Israel is tirelessly working to provide for humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip,” COGAT said.
Israel earlier this year rejected what it called the “grossly distorted” accusation of genocide leveled against it by South Africa, arguing in the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) that its war was fought in self-defense and that it was targeting Hamas rather than Palestinians, following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, terror attacks in Israel.
The UN Special Committee is composed of three UN member states, including Malaysia, Senegal and Sri Lanka.
The UN report comes after the US-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report detailing Israel’s forced mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza in a deliberate and systematic campaign that amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity.
In a response to the HRW report on Thursday, the Israeli military said it is “committed to international law and operates accordingly,” and that it issues evacuation orders to protect civilians from combat.
Palestinians fleeing northern Gaza after weeks of intense Israeli military operations in recent weeks have told described a chronic lack of food and people dying of hunger, as aid agencies warn that the area is on the brink of famine.
But after a US deadline for Israel to improve getting humanitarian aid into Gaza expired this week, the Biden administration assessed that Israel is not blocking aid and so is not violating US law governing foreign military assistance. The State Department said that while changes were needed, progress had been made, so there would be no disruption to US arms supplies.
But the US view is a stark contrast with the bleak picture on the ground, where much of the aid that reaches Gaza is not being distributed.
“We have not seen any aid, and no one has sent us food,” 63-year-old Palestinian Umm Muhammad Al-At’out told CNN this week. “Our children have died of hunger and thirst.”
The accounts of desperate civilians echo the World Health Organization’s warning last Friday of “a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/europe/israel-france-soccer-amsterdam-intl/index.html,Fans scuffle despite heavy security presence at France-Israel soccer match,2024-11-14 05:01:47,"A brief scuffle broke out in the stands as Israeli soccer fans returned to Europe, but a heavy security presence in Paris ensured there was no repeat of the large-scale violence seen in Amsterdam last week.
Thousands of extra security personnel were deployed in the French capital and a “double ring” of security thrown around the stadium for the Nations League game between France and Israel, a week after shocking violent attacks marred Israeli club Maccabi-Tel Aviv’s visit to Amsterdam amid accusations of organized “hunting” of Jews and aggression from some traveling Israeli fans.
In Paris on Thursday, the atmosphere was tense at the at Stade de France - and French authorities were taking no chances.
It only took about a minute for security personnel to step in when a scuffle broke out early in the game between a small number of supporters in a stand behind one of the goals, the Associated Press reported. Some of those involved were draped in Israeli flags, but it was not clear what caused the altercation, AP said.
The match finished 0-0 with no further incidents.
Some 4,000 officers and 1,600 stadium staff were deployed to police the game, with about 2,500 of those officers around the stadium itself, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez said.
Last year’s French soccer cup final saw some 3,000 police and 1,400 staff deployed, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.
The elite RAID police unit was present inside the grounds, according to France’s interior minister. An “anti-terrorist security perimeter” was set up around the stadium to ensure two separate ID checks and searches for attendees.
The game came just days after several nights of clashes in Amsterdam. At least five people were treated in hospital and dozens were arrested after Israeli fans were hunted down and attacked following Maccabi Tel Aviv’s 5-0 defeat to Ajax in violence condemned as antisemitic by authorities in the Netherlands and Israel.
Tensions were running high ahead of the match in Amsterdam. Multiple social media videos showed Maccabi fans chanting anti-Arab slurs, praising Israeli military attacks in Gaza and yelling “f**k the Arabs.”
Maccabi supporters also tore down flags, vandalized a taxi and set a Palestinian flag on fire, Amsterdam police said.
The supporters of the Israeli national side who traveled to Paris were likely to differ from the fans at Amsterdam’s Maccabi match – some of whom have a reputation for hooliganism and violence.
French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he was expecting 12,000-13,000 fans total for the match, one of the lowest turnouts ever at the 80,000-capacity Stade de France, the centerpiece of Paris’ 2024 Olympic Games.
On Sunday, Israel specifically warned its citizens against attending the match over fears for their safety. Even so, officials were determined for the game to go ahead.
Retailleau refused to cancel or move the match, telling parliamentarians that doing so would amount to “giving in to sowers of hate.”
Instead, the country’s flagship stadium was turned into a veritable fortress.
But the match wasn’t notable for its security.
French President Emmanuel Macron attended the game, an unusual move for a relatively minor fixture on the global soccer stage. The Elysee Palace told CNN affiliate BFMTV that his presence would, “send a message of fraternity and solidarity after the intolerable antisemitic acts that followed the match in Amsterdam.”
Macron was joined by his prime minister and two of his predecessors, former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy – a rare display of unity.
An iron-fisted response
This game came at a particularly tense time for politics and sport in France.
Last week, Retailleau demanded answers from French champions Paris Saint-Germain after fans unfurled an enormous “Free Palestine” display in the stands at a Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid.
Following the match, Retailleau posted on X that clubs should be wary that, “politics does not come to damage sport, which must always remain a force for unity,” promising in a later radio interview that “nothing was off the table” in terms of sanctions against clubs that refuse to toe the line and police “political” banners.
The minister set an aggressive tone in his first months in office and his response to the Amsterdam attacks was no different. Retailleau called for prosecutors to investigate a far-left lawmaker’s post about the violence in the Dutch capital – a move that is unprecedented even amid the heightened tensions following the Hamas-led October 7 assault on Israel last year and the ongoing war in Gaza that followed.
Marie Mesmeur had posted that the Israelis attacked in Amsterdam, “were not lynched because they were Jewish, but because they were racist and supported genocide.”
The official French response could not be more different.
Macron said the incidents, “recalled the most shameful hours of history,” in sentiments mirrored by top French officials in a flurry of X posts.
France – like much of Europe and North America – has grappled with spiking antisemitism in recent years, which has only been accentuated by the October 7 attacks and Israel’s bloody campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon.
In France specifically, less than 1% of the French population is Jewish, yet Jews are victims of 57% of all racist and antireligious attacks in the country, Retailleau told lawmakers on Tuesday.
France is home to Europe’s largest Jewish population and one of the continent’s biggest Muslim populations. In recent years, French far-right politicians have clamored to claim the moral high ground around antisemitism.
All this comes amid a diplomatic spat between Paris and Tel Aviv. Just this week, the Israeli ambassador in Paris was summoned to the French foreign ministry after two French policemen were briefly detained in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem.
France’s government has attempted to tread a difficult path between responding to Hamas’ attacks on Israel and growing antisemitism at home, and outrage at Israel’s destruction in Gaza and elsewhere. Yet, in the light of recent events in Amsterdam, it is keen to show its commitment to protecting French Jews: Thursday’s match offered the perfect opportunity.",['Joseph Ataman'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/middleeast/israel-expands-ground-operation-lebanon-intl-latam/index.html,Israel says it has expanded its military ground operation in Lebanon,2024-11-13 22:26:34,"Israel’s military ground operation in southern Lebanon has been expanded, the country’s defense minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday.
Katz did not clarify when the decision to expand operations was taken and did not offer any details on what the expansion entails. Israel launched what it described as a “limited ground operation” to expel Hezbollah from southern Lebanon early last month.
“We have expanded the ground maneuver in southern Lebanon and we are operating against Hezbollah targets in the Dahiyeh district in Beirut and wherever necessary,” Katz told soldiers during his first visit to Israel’s Northern Command.
There were nearly 20 Israeli airstrikes against what the Israeli military described as Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Beirut on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The newly appointed defense minister maintained that Israel will not agree to “any ceasefires.”
“We will not take our foot off the pedal,” Katz said, adding that Israel will not “agree to any deal that does not ensure the disarmament of Hezbollah and its withdrawal across the Litani River – and especially Israel’s right to enforce … and act against any terrorist activity and organization.”
The Litani river is some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Israel’s northern border.
Israel’s strikes across Lebanon killed at least 43 people on Thursday, including eight civil defense workers, according to Lebanon’s health ministry and civil defense directorate.
The General Directorate of the Civil Defense said on X that an Israeli strike destroyed their headquarters in the village of Douris near Baalbek.
The civil defense building was hit “while a number of workers were inside, ready to receive calls for relief and immediate intervention to assist citizens,” the directorate said in a statement.
Three other people were killed in the same strike, the health ministry said.
CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the alleged strikes on civil defense workers.
The IDF told CNN earlier on Thursday that it “has been operating to defend Israel’s northern border, striking military targets in order to counter the continuing threat Hezbollah poses to Israeli homes and families.”
The IDF also accused Hezbollah of escalating its attacks against Israel and said the militant group has fired over 16,000 rockets into Israel since October 8, 2023.
Earlier on Thursday, an Israeli strike hit al-Shaab neighborhood in Baalbek, killing eight people and injuring 27 others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Four other people were killed and 14 others were injured in two separate airstrikes in the Baalbek-Hermel region, the ministry added.
Separately, an Israeli strike targeted a mobile center of the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority in the southern Lebanese village of Arabsalim, killing six people, including four health workers, the health ministry said on Thursday.
Despite the Israeli ground operation into southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has maintained a daily barrage of rockets against parts of northern Israel and continues to launch drones against Israeli cities. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said around 50 projectiles were fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon into Israel on Wednesday.
Hezbollah on Wednesday said it had carried out at least 20 attacks against Israel and its troops in Lebanon with drones, missiles, and rockets, saying its actions were “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip … and in defense of Lebanon and its people.”
Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Naim Qassem on Wednesday praised the militant group’s fighters for their support in a handwritten letter published online. The letter comes after the group’s members expressed support over the weekend for his leadership. Qassem was named the group’s new leader in late October, a month after his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike.
Growing toll on civilians
Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon continues to exact a heavy toll on civilians. Airstrikes on several towns across Lebanon have killed at least 20 children since Sunday, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
In the town of Joun in southern Lebanon, at least eight children were killed on Tuesday, the ministry said. A separate attack on Tuesday killed at two children in Baalchmay, southeast of Beirut.
On Wednesday, an Israeli attack in the village of Dawhet Aramoun, south of Beirut, left three children dead. On Sunday, an Israeli strike in the village of Aalmat, north of Beirut, left seven children dead.
The Israeli military told CNN on Thursday that it has been “operating to defend Israel’s northern border, striking military targets in order to counter the continuing threat Hezbollah poses to Israeli homes and families,” since cross-border hostilities escalated on October 8, 2023.
“Hezbollah has continued to escalate its attacks against Israel, firing over 16,000 rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel, killing civilians and displacing tens of thousands from their homes,” the IDF said, adding that it makes “great efforts to estimate and consider potential civilian collateral damage.”
The number of children killed in Lebanon over the past 50 days now accounts for 80% of all children killed in the past year, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said Wednesday in a post on X.
“Children in Lebanon are enduring the deadliest phase of this war,” he added.
As of Tuesday, at least 2,683 people had been killed and 12,144 injured in Lebanon since mid-September when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of health ministry figures. The health ministry numbers do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.
Katz’s announcement about expanding Israel’s ground operation also comes as the military confirmed the death of six Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. This marks one of the deadliest days for Israeli troops in Lebanon since the start of the ground incursion on October 1. The deadliest day so far was on October 2, when eight soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon.
Those killed on Wednesday were all from the Golani brigade – regarded as an elite infantry unit – and included a platoon commander, a squad commander, a squad sergeant, and three soldiers, the IDF said.
At least 41 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Lebanon since the start of Israel’s ground incursion on October 1, according to a CNN tally of the IDF figures. At least 792 Israeli soldiers have been killed, including 373 killed inside the Gaza Strip, since Hamas’s deadly attacks on the country on October 7, 2023, according to the IDF.",['Mohammed Tawfeeq'],en

“Given their critical roles in driving policies that promote settler violence, weaken the Palestinian Authority, facilitate de facto and de jure annexation, and destabilize the West Bank, we urge you to sanction Finance Minister (Bezalel) Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir,” they wrote.
The letter was signed by a significant number of Democrats – 17 senators and 71 members of the House of Representatives – and was sent at the end of October, before the US election which Donald Trump won. It was made public on Thursday in order to pressure Biden to take action during his final months in office as frustration grows from within Biden’s own party about his administration’s seeming unwillingness to hold the Israeli government to account.
“We’ve not yet gotten a response from the White House, and we think the clock is ticking in the aftermath of the election,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, one of the lead lawmakers who signed the letter. “We do think that there’s a pretty short window, obviously, for the Biden administration to take this action.”
“We see President-elect Trump’s nominations, and we think it’s more important than ever that President Biden right now state that the United States is not going to be a rubber stamp to the Netanyahu government’s extreme actions on the West Bank,” he said.
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
In February, Biden issued an executive order allowing sanctions on those undermining “peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.” The lawmakers urged the president to sanction Smotrich and Ben Gvir using this authority.
Although officials within the Biden administration have denounced Smotrich and Ben Gvir for their extremist rhetoric and actions in the West Bank, they have yet to impose sanctions on them. Just this week, Smotrich, on the heels of Trump’s reelection, ordered preparations for the annexation of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In June, he announced plans to legally recognize five unauthorized Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Ben Gvir has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism.
The lawmakers also urged Biden to sanction two organizations – Amana, which they said “has long played a key role in establishing the majority of West Bank settlements and provides loans and building infrastructure for new outposts that are illegal under Israeli law” and Regavim, “which was co-founded by Smotrich” and whose “mission is to obstruct Palestinian construction in the West Bank.”
“With radical officials in the Netanyahu government continuing to enable settler violence and enact annexationist policies, it is clear that further sanctions are urgently needed,” the lawmakers wrote. “The key individuals and entities that are destabilizing the West Bank – thereby also threatening the security of Israel and the broader region, and US
national security as well – should be directly held accountable.”
“The message that such actions are unacceptable from leaders, including within the Israeli government, must be heard,” they wrote in the letter, which was also led by Sen. Dick Durbin, Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Rep. Sean Casten.
Last week, United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country is considering sanctions on the two far-right ministers.",['Jennifer Hansler'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/business/ben-and-jerrys-israel-gaza-unilever/index.html,Ben & Jerry’s says its parent company Unilever silenced it over Gaza,2024-11-14 12:41:27,"Ben & Jerry’s said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that parent company Unilever has silenced its attempts to express support for Palestinian refugees and threatened to dismantle its board and sue its members over the issue.
The lawsuit is the latest sign of the long-simmering tensions between Ben & Jerry’s and consumer products maker Unilever. A rift erupted between the two in 2021 after Ben & Jerry’s said it would stop selling its products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank because it was inconsistent with its values, a move that led some investors to divest Unilever shares.
The ice cream maker then sued Unilever for selling its business in Israel to its licensee there, which allowed marketing in the West Bank and Israel to continue. That lawsuit was settled in 2022.
In its new lawsuit, Ben & Jerry’s says that Unilever has breached the terms of the 2022 settlement, which has remained confidential. As part of the agreement, however, Unilever is required to “respect and acknowledge the Ben & Jerry’s independent board’s primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry’s social mission,” according to the lawsuit.
“Ben & Jerry’s has on four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights,” according to the lawsuit. “Unilever has silenced each of these efforts.”
In response, Unilever said in an emailed statement: “Our heart goes out to all victims of the tragic events in the Middle East. We reject the claims made by B&J’s social mission board, and we will defend our case very strongly.”
“We would not comment further on this legal matter,” it added.
Ben & Jerry’s said in the lawsuit it has tried to call for a ceasefire, support the safe passage of Palestinian refugees to Britain, back students protesting at U.S. colleges against civilian deaths in Gaza, and advocate for a halt in U.S. military aid to Israel, but has been blocked by Unilever.
The independent board separately spoke out on some of those topics, but the company was muzzled, the lawsuit says.
Ben & Jerry’s said that Peter ter Kulve, Unilever’s head of ice cream, said he was concerned about the “continued perception of anti-Semitism” regarding the ice cream brand voicing its opinions on Gazan refugees, according to the lawsuit.
Unilever was also required under the settlement agreement to make a total of $5 million in payments to Ben & Jerry’s for the brand to make donations to human rights groups of its choosing, according to the lawsuit.
Ben & Jerry’s selected the left-leaning Jewish Voice for Peace and the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, among others, the filing says.
Unilever in August objected to the selections, saying that Jewish Voice for Peace was “too critical of the Israeli government,” according to the lawsuit.
Ben & Jerry’s has positioned itself as socially conscious since Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield founded the company in a renovated gas station in 1978. It kept that mission after Unilever acquired it in 2000.
In March, Unilever said it will spin off its ice cream business, which includes Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 to simplify its holdings.
Unilever’s dozens of products include Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise, Knorr bouillon cubes, Surf detergent and Vaseline petroleum jelly.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/middleeast/un-israel-violation-golan-heights-syria-intl/index.html,UN sounds alarm at Israel’s ‘severe violations’ at key buffer zone with Syria,2024-11-13 14:20:53,"The United Nations has accused Israel of “severe violations” of a 50-year-old agreement with Syria, saying it has engaged in “engineering groundwork activities” that encroach on a key buffer zone in the Golan Heights.
“Violations of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement have occurred where engineering works have encroached into the AoS (the area of separation),” the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), which has maintained the ceasefire between Israel and Syria since 1974, said in a statement Tuesday.
Satellite imagery from Planet Labs and the European Space Agency shows that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been conducting excavation activity near Jubata Al Khashab, Syria since mid-August. A large earthen berm, roughly 40 feet (12 meters) wide, is being dug.
The trench now stretches almost five miles (eight kilometers).
Work on extending the trench even further is continuing, according to recent satellite imagery. In a Planet Labs image taken on November 5, an excavator and other vehicles can be seen working.
The “extensive engineering groundwork activities” run along the so-called Alpha Line that separates Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, UNDOF said, adding that the construction began in July and includes the use of “excavators and other earth-moving equipment with protection from armored vehicles and soldiers.” Main battle tanks of the IDF were also occasionally present in the demilitarized zone, violating the 1974 agreement.
The UN peacekeeping mission said it has “repeatedly engaged with the IDF to protest the construction” work, which has worried Syrian authorities, who have also “strongly protested.”
In response to the accusations, the IDF told CNN that it is “working to establish a barrier on Israeli territory exclusively in order to thwart a possible terrorist invasion and protect the security of Israel’s borders,” adding that “Israeli and IDF officials maintain close contact with UN officials who are familiar with the threats in the region.”
Breaching the buffer zone
UNDOF warned on Tuesday that Israel’s “severe violations” at the buffer zone “have the potential to increase tensions in the area.”
The peacekeeping force and its mandate were born out of a US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria in May 1974, following months of fighting in a war launched by Egyptian and Syrian forces against Israel in October 1973.
The agreement created a buffer zone, as well as two equal zones of limited forces and armaments on both sides of the area. While Israel and Syria remain formally at war, this agreement has largely maintained peace with the help of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Golan.
For Israel, the Golan Heights is a strategic plateau seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, and formally annexed in 1981. The hilly landscape, which spans some 500 square miles, is home to some 20,000 Arab Druze and about 25,000 Jewish Israelis spread across more than 30 settlements.
It also shares a border with Jordan and Lebanon, where Israel has been waging a war against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
Israel sees the Golan Heights as key to its national security interests and says it needs to control the region to fend off threats from Syria and Iranian proxy groups there.
On Tuesday, UNDOF said that upon engaging Israel about the violations, the Israeli side said the construction is “being carried out for defensive purpose to prevent unauthorized crossing and violations by civilians” along the Alpha Line on the Israeli side.
Navvar Saban, a researcher at the Harmoon Center for Contemporary Studies who specializes in Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq, said Israeli activities in the Golan are likely for defensive purposes, as the IDF seeks to enhance its existing structures.
“This can be considered a precautionary move from the Israeli side for any possible increased operations from Hezbollah militias in that area,” Saban told CNN.
Israeli strikes inside Syria
Israel has for months been conducting strikes inside Syria, saying it is targeting Iranian or Hezbollah interests. In April, following an Israeli strike on what Tehran said was a diplomatic building in Damascus, Iran responded by launching a barrage of missiles and drones directly at Israel.
In July, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah spiked after a deadly rocket attack hit a soccer field in the Arab town of Majdal Shams in the Golan, killing at least 12 children. Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, which the Lebanese group denied.
The Israeli military on Wednesday said it had struck “smuggling routes” between Lebanon and Syria, that it alleges were used to transfer weapons to Hezbollah.
The Israeli military said the strikes were part of a larger effort to target the capabilities of a Hezbollah unit responsible for weapons smuggling. The IDF also accused the Syrian regime of abusing civilian infrastructure for its support to Hezbollah. CNN has reached out to the Syrian Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry for comment.
The Syrian defense ministry earlier on Wednesday said an Israeli strike targeted bridges over the Orontes River and roads on the Syria-Lebanon border in the Qusayr area of the Homs countryside in western Syria. The strike “caused significant damage to these bridges and roads, rendering them out of service,” the ministry said.
Saban said that Hezbollah is unlikely to try and trigger an Israeli military offensive from the Golan, however.
“Syria is the only remaining backdoor for Hezbollah,” he told CNN, adding that Hezbollah has not operated in the area against Israel the way it has from southern Lebanon. The group cannot handle the “shock” of another front from the Israelis, he said.
Israel has in recent months accused Syria of violating the 1974 agreement. In July, the IDF said it struck Syrian military infrastructure in retaliation for alleged breaches. “The IDF holds the Syrian military responsible for all activities occurring within its territory and will not allow any attempts to violate Israeli sovereignty,” the Israeli military said.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/middleeast/hrw-israel-gaza-displacement-war-crime-intl-hnk/index.html,Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of mass displacement in Gaza amounting to a war crime,2024-11-14 05:03:40,"Israel has overseen the forced mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza in a deliberate and systematic campaign that amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity, according to a new Human Rights Watch report.
The 154-page report, published by the US-based advocacy group on Thursday, details more than 13 months of widespread destruction in Gaza that, according to the United Nations, has seen the displacement of about 1.9 million Palestinians – more than 90% of the territory’s population.
In a statement, Human Rights Watch (HRW) cited the illegal and “deliberate, controlled demolitions of homes and civilian infrastructure,” by Israeli forces in Gaza “where they have apparent aims of creating ‘buffer zones’ and security ‘corridors,’ from which Palestinians are likely to be permanently displaced.”
“The Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs so-called safe zones, and cuts off food, water, and sanitation,” said Nadia Hardman, a HRW refugee and migrant rights researcher.
“Israel has blatantly violated its obligation to ensure Palestinians can return home, razing virtually everything in large areas.”
In a response to the report on Thursday, the Israeli military said it is “committed to international law and operates accordingly,” and that it issues evacuation orders to protect civilians from combat.
The Israeli military also denied there was any “doctrine that aims causing maximal damage to civilian infrastructure regardless of military necessity,” and said any “reports and complaints regarding the violation of international law” are referred to an internal review body.
Israel has been accused by multiple human rights groups – and UN investigators – of military conduct that could amount to war crimes over the past year, which it has vociferously denied. Hamas has also been accused of war crimes.
In October, a UN inquiry said Israel had a “concerted policy” of destroying the health care system in Gaza in what it said amounted to war crimes.
The Israeli foreign ministry called those accusations “outrageous” and said they were “another blatant attempt by the (commission) to delegitimize the very existence of the State of Israel and obstruct its right to protect its population while covering up the crimes of terrorist organizations.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said that “Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.”
On Sunday, Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar said Palestinians would be able to return to their homes in northern Gaza when the war ends – but not before Israel’s objectives were achieved.
Several Israeli ministers, however, have said they would like to see Palestinians leave Gaza and reestablish Israeli settlements there.
“We must promote a solution to encourage the emigration of the residents of Gaza,” far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on January 1.
And far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry, has said Israel “will rule (in Gaza). And in order to rule there securely for a long time, we must have a civilian presence.”
The HRW report comes after the US State Department said Tuesday that Israel had not violated United States law following the passing of a 30-day deadline for it to take specific steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza – a stance in sharp contrast to the findings of aid organizations about the dire reality in the enclave.
Aid agencies have described the situation in northern Gaza as apocalyptic, with areas at imminent risk of famine as Israel wages an ongoing military offensive there.
Human Rights Watch said the Israeli campaign in northern Gaza would likely lead to the displacement of hundreds of thousands more civilians.
The group urged countries to halt arms sales to Israel and impose sanctions on the Jewish state to push it to comply with its international obligations to protect civilians. It also called on the International Criminal Court to investigate the alleged forced displacement of Palestinians as a crime against humanity.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/europe/us-israel-aid-gaza-insufficient-intl/index.html,The US says Israel is doing enough to bring aid into Gaza. On the ground it is a different story,2024-11-13 15:31:01,"A US deadline for Israel to improve getting humanitarian aid into Gaza has expired, with the Biden administration assessing that Israel is not blocking aid and so is not violating US law governing foreign military assistance.
The State Department said that while changes were needed, progress had been made - so there would be no disruption to US arms supplies.
But the US view is a stark contrast with the bleak picture on the ground, where much of the aid that reaches Gaza is not being distributed.
Civilians fleeing northern Gaza after weeks of intense Israeli military operations tell of a chronic lack of food and people dying of hunger, as aid agencies warn that the area is on the brink of famine.
“We have not seen any aid, and no-one has sent us food,” 63-year-old Umm Muhammad Al-At’out told CNN this week. “Our children have died of hunger and thirst.”
Her account of people dying from hunger was supported by others CNN spoke to in northern Gaza, where the Israeli military resumed ground operations early in October.
Abu Ahmed Subaih from Beit Lahiya told CNN that he had walked for miles with his parents, who are in their 80s. “There is no food of any kind,” he said.
A woman who gave her name as Ghalia and said she was 83 told CNN: “We no longer know vegetables, meat or fruits. We used to live on canned food, and now there’s no canned food.”
The accounts of desperate civilians echo the the World Health Organization’s warning last Friday of “a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip.”
On Wednesday, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, told CNN that the hospital had received dozens of cases of malnutrition among children and adults.
Multiple factors have contributed to what aid agencies are calling the worst point for the humanitarian situation in Gaza since the war began in October 2023.
They include ongoing Israeli military operations, evacuation orders affecting hundreds of thousands of people, a breakdown in law and order that has led to looting of aid convoys, a lack of truck drivers and the frequent denial of passage for aid by Israeli authorities.
Last month, the Biden administration gave Israel a 30-day deadline to take specific steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including boosting commercial traffic and ending the isolation of the north.
As the deadline expired, the US State Department said it had “not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of US law” and that they would face no penalties.
Much of the aid community disagrees.
On Tuesday, eight humanitarian organizations said the Israeli government “not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in northern Gaza.”
One of those groups is Mercy Corps, whose director Kate Phillips-Barrasso, told CNN that commercial traffic into Gaza had “ground to a complete halt.”
“We really are at a tipping point in terms of this turning into a catastrophic food insecurity situation,” Phillips-Barrasso said.
According to the World Food Programme, the average number of trucks entering Gaza fell to just 58 per day in the second half of October, the lowest level since November last year.
Before the war began, around 500 commercial and aid trucks were entering each day.
COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza, said Saturday that 713 aid trucks had arrived in northern Gaza through the Erez West crossing since the beginning of October. But much of this aid remains at the crossing point.
The same applies to Kerem Shalom, which borders eastern Gaza. COGAT told CNN Wednesday that 900 truckloads were waiting on the Gaza side of Kerem Shalom, the maximum capacity. But it added that supplies from 122 trucks had been picked up Tuesday.
Aid organizations have often said that distribution of food and water amid Israeli strikes, evacuation orders and the absence of secure corridors is almost impossible.
They also say that Israeli authorities frequently delay or deny passage within Gaza. The World Food Programme (WFP) told CNN Tuesday that planned deliveries to parts of northern Gaza in most urgent need had been denied by Israeli authorities.
Last week, it said, an approved convoy of ten food trucks was held for two hours in Jabalya, “where some of the food was offloaded by people who surrounded the trucks.”
The food never reached locations where displaced Palestinians were sheltering, it said.
Joyce Msuya, acting UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council Tuesday that Israeli authorities were “blocking humanitarian assistance from entering North Gaza, where fighting continues, and around 75,000 people remain with dwindling water and food supplies.”
In response to a request for comment, COGAT told CNN that “the State of Israel allows and facilitates the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip, particularly to its northern area.” The Israeli military “through COGAT, maintains regular communication with international aid organizations to monitor warehouse stock levels, as well as ongoing contact with hospitals regarding the humanitarian needs on the ground.”
A planned 14-truck WFP aid convoy had intended to deliver supplies to Beit Hanoun and the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalya, but only two trucks reached their destination due to “delays in movement authorization and crowded routes,” OCHA said on Tuesday.
The Israeli military said Tuesday that “hundreds of food packages and thousands of liters of water were delivered to distribution centers for the civilian population remaining in the Beit Hanoun area” on Monday.
But shipments of such size only scratch the surface of the immense need.
In addition to the lack of aid, 13 months of constant air strikes have left agriculture and industry in Gaza in ruins. Most of the enclave’s agricultural land is in the north and along the eastern border with Israel, areas from which hundreds of thousands of people have fled.
The vast majority of Gazans have little or no work and can’t afford to buy food at inflated prices.
Saber Salem, a father of 10 now in Gaza City, told CNN Wednesday: “Every two months maybe we would get an aid coupon. There is nothing to buy and if available the goods are expensive.”
Communal soup kitchens and bakeries are also closing or short of supplies.
Amjad Al-Shawa - head of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network (PNGO) in Gaza – told CNN that soup kitchens which served 300,000 people a day with a hot meal had now closed, and so had many bakeries.
There is also the issue of profiteering. On Sunday, dozens of people marched through a market in Gaza City, chanting: “We are the people, you merchants are thieves!”
One young man told CNN: “They are selling a kilo of sugar for 80 shekels instead of two.”
The pervasive desperation has led to frequent incidents of looting, both of warehouses and convoys. Late in October CNN filmed a desperate brawl for bread at one of the few functioning bakeries.
But much of the looting is by organized gangs.
The president of Gaza’s Transportation Association, Nahd Shuheiber, said this week there has been “an increase in the theft of trucks loaded with humanitarian aid,” because of a lack of police.
Police in Gaza have often been targeted by Israeli strikes as they are seen as being associated with Hamas.
Shuheiber said that “bandits” near the Kerem Shalom crossing had been stealing from the trucks, “creating a state of chaos under which we are unable to operate effectively.”
Barroso-Phillips of Mercy Corps told CNN that needs in Gaza far outstrip what is getting past its borders.
“And as a result, we are likely to have people starving to death literally miles away from where food is available.”

Asif W. Rahman was indicted last Thursday for willfully retaining and transmitting national defense information, according to court documents. He was arrested Tuesday in Cambodia and will first appear in court in Guam, though the department has asked a federal judge to move him to Virginia to stand trial.
Rahman was employed by the CIA, according to a person familiar with his employment. Court documents indicate he was employed by the US government.
Rahman held a top secret security clearance and could access sensitive compartmentalized information.
The New York Times first reported Rahman’s indictment.
The documents were posted by a Telegram account in mid-October called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.
CNN previously reported that one of the documents, which says it was compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, discussed a plan involving Israel moving munitions. The other, which says it is sourced to the National Security Agency, outlines Israeli Air Force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles.
One of the documents also suggests something that Israel has always declined to confirm publicly: that the country has nuclear weapons. The document says the US has not seen any indications that Israel plans to use a nuclear weapon against Iran.

During a gathering of leaders of Islamic nations hosted by Saudi Arabia in Riyadh on Monday, the country’s de facto leader said: “The Kingdom reiterates its condemnation and absolute refusal of the collective genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people.”
More than 43,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its attacks on the enclave last year. On Tuesday, at least 30 people were killed in Gaza city and northern Gaza, with many more still under the rubble, according to the spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal. CNN has asked the Israeli military for comment.
Last year the kingdom was in the process of negotiating a historic normalization agreement with Israel but recently said that was “off the table” without Palestinian statehood, a demand rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Saudi crown prince, widely known by his initials MBS, also defended Iran – a stark contrast to his comments in 2017 comparing the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to Adolf Hitler.
MBS urged the international community to “compel Israel to respect Iran’s sovereignty and not to attack (Iranian) territories.” Riyadh and Tehran repaired ties last year after decades of animosity over regional influence.
With no solution in sight for the regional conflicts and amid a stalled normalization process with Israel, Saudi Arabia has changed its messaging over the past year from condemnations to publicly accusing Israel of genocide while urging more international protection for Iran.
Iran sent its First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref to Monday’s Riyadh conference, who in his speech mourned the deaths of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar. Saudi Arabia strongly opposes Iran-backed militias such as Hezbollah and Hamas.
Others attending the high-level meeting included Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
Presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who were also at the meeting, remain embroiled in an ongoing conflict over Turkey’s military operations in northern Syria and its support for rebel groups.
The stated goal of Monday’s meeting was “unifying positions” and “exerting pressure” on the international community to take steps to end the “ongoing attacks and establish lasting peace,” in the region, Saudi’s governmental state agency said.
Unifying in the wake of the US election
Experts say MBS gathered regional allies and old foes to exhibit his strength in unifying Islamic nations ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump assuming office.
Throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump had not specified how he would approach the Israel-Hamas war, or how his policies would differ from those of his predecessor Joe Biden. In April, Trump said that Israel needs to “finish what they started” and “get it over with fast,” noting that it was “losing the PR war” because of the images coming out of Gaza.
But the incoming US president would likely seek to reinstate the sanctions regimes on Tehran to “isolate Iran diplomatically” and “weaken it economically,” Brian Hook, who was Trump’s Iran envoy during his first administration, told CNN’s Becky Anderson last week.
Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who sources say is likely to be his selection for secretary of state, have hardline policies on Iran.
“He has a lot of friendships in the region with leaders. Those friendships, I think, are only going to deepen and I think the cooperation and the bonds of friendship, security and commerce are all going to be much better in the coming years,” Hook said of Trump.
Saudi Arabia, which had helped Trump in his policy of Iranian containment during his first term, is wary this time of supporting a “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, due to skepticism of US willingness to protect the kingdom in the face of an Iranian attack, analysts say.
Instead, the kingdom has been expanding its relationship with Iran. This week, MBS spoke with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, welcomed his vice president in Riyadh and dispatched the Saudi army chief of staff to Tehran for meetings with his Iranian counterpart.
The kingdom is trying to make sure it’s staying out of any war that involves the US, Israel and Iran because of domestic anger against Israel from their own populations but also because of the effectiveness of Iranian ballistic missiles, executive vice president of the Washington, DC-based Quincy Institute Trita Parsi said.
There are several political risks to normalizing relations with Israel today, said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “With normalization Saudi Arabia recognizes that it will be risking possible internal political dissent, a regional Arab leadership role and a global Islamic leadership role that is very contested,” Ibish said.
“The message from Riyadh is we want to play ball, but you have to give us something, and not just on Palestine, on Iran too … we’re not going to do a deal with the Israelis if you don’t make it worth our while,” Ibish said.",['Mostafa Salem'],en

Mike Huckabee to serve as United States ambassador to Israel, a strong defender of Israel who once argued that there was “no such thing as a Palestinian.”
“Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!” Trump said in a statement.
Huckabee’s daughter, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, served as Trump’s press secretary during his first administration.
Huckabee has been staunchly pro-Israeli throughout his career – including on what he says is the country’s claims to the West Bank.
On Wednesday he said it was “of course” possible that the US would back the Israeli government if it were to try and annex the Israeli-occupied territory.
In an interview on Israeli Army Radio, Huckabee was asked whether the Trump administration would support annexation in the West Bank, known in Israel as applying “sovereignty.”
“Well of course,” Huckabee said. “I won’t make the policy, I will carry out the policy of the president. But he has already demonstrated in his first term that there’s never been an American president that has been more helpful in securing an understanding of the sovereignty of Israel.”
“From the moving of the embassy, recognition of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem as the capital. No one has done more than President Trump. And I fully expect that that will continue.”
Israel has occupied the West Bank since seizing the territory from Jordan in 1967. In the decades since, it has expanded Jewish settlements in the area, which are considered illegal under international law, despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s. Around half a million Israelis live in West Bank settlements.
His selection will come as a welcome culmination of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s long mission to shore up ties to American evangelicals.
Huckabee has spent ample time in Israel, and he led a tour in the country for the company Senior Adult Travel Inc. as recently as May, according to the company’s website.
In a video obtained by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski during Huckabee’s 2015 run for president, Huckabee suggested that if a Palestinian state were to be created, it should be in neighboring countries like Egypt, Syria or Jordan, rather than within Israel’s borders.
“Basically, there really is no such thing as — I need to be careful about saying this, because people will really get upset — there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian,” Huckabee said at a 2008 campaign stop in Massachusetts while speaking to two Orthodox Jewish men. “There’s not.”
He’s been a supporter of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including laying a cornerstone for a new neighborhood in one of the largest settlements, just east of Jerusalem, in 2017.
He told CNN’s Oren Lieberman at the time that he rejected the use of the word “settlements.”
“I think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,” said Huckabee, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. “There are certain words I refuse to use. There is no such thing as a West Bank. It’s Judea and Samaria. There’s no such thing as a settlement. They’re communities, they’re neighborhoods, they’re cities. There’s no such thing as an occupation.”
Israeli officials welcome Trump’s pick
Israeli officials welcomed Trump’s choice of ambassador.
Far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who is pushing for the annexation of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, congratulated Huckabee in a post on X.
Smotrich, who is in charge of the settlements, wrote of Huckabee, “As a consistent and loyal friend of the State of Israel and a supporter of the settlement enterprise in Judea and Samaria, who for many years fought for our state and our right to all parts of the Land of Israel, I have no doubt that we have won and together with him we will strengthen Israel’s security and strength and strengthen our hold in all its spaces.”
Newly appointed Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called Huckabee a “longstanding friend of Israel” in a post on X and said he looks forward to working to “strengthen the bond between our peoples.”
Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, also congratulated Huckabee, saying, “I think he will be a great ambassador to Israel.” Dannon said Huckabee is “very familiar” with the facts on the ground and has been to Israel multiple times, including after the deadly October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.
Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir also expressed his support. He posted Huckabee’s name to X, followed by emojis of the American flag, a heart and an Israeli flag.

Mike Huckabee, who President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday was his pick to serve as US ambassador to Israel, previously argued that there was “no such thing as a Palestinian.”
Huckabee, who has been a strong defender of Israel throughout his career, made the statement during his 2008 presidential campaign, asserting that Palestinian identity was “a political tool to try and force land away from Israel.”
In a video obtained by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski during Huckabee’s 2015 run for president, Huckabee suggested that if a Palestinian state were to be created, it should be in neighboring countries like Egypt, Syria or Jordan, rather than within Israel’s borders.

In response to a question from one of the men about the possibility of a Palestinian state existing outside of Israel, Huckabee said he believed this was the preferable option.
“You have Arabs and Persians,” Huckabee continued at the 2008 appearance. “And there’s such complexity in that. But there’s really no such thing. That’s been a political tool to try and force land away from Israel.”
In the video, which was previously published by BuzzFeed, Huckabee added that he thought a Palestinian state could be made out of land in Egypt, Syria or Jordan.
“My point is, if that’s the issue, if it’s real estate, if you look at a map, and say here is how much Israel has and here is how much the Arab states hold, there is plenty of land,” he said.
Huckabee reiterated that point during a 2015 interview on Israeli TV, in which he argued that a two-state solution was “irrational and unworkable” and said “there’s plenty of land” outside of Israel in the “rest of the world” for a Palestinian state.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/israel-gaza-humanitarian-situation-report/index.html,"US has not assessed Israel is violating law on Gaza aid, will not change policy despite humanitarian groups’ findings",2024-11-12 05:01:04,"The Biden administration has not assessed that Israel is in violation of US law and will not change its policy at this time, a State Department spokesperson said Tuesday on the US-mandated 30-day deadline for the Netanyahu government to take specific steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
The US statement comes in sharp contrast to the findings of humanitarian aid organizations, who say that “the humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated to its worst point since the war began in October 2023.” The situation in northern Gaza in particular has been described as “apocalyptic,” with areas at “imminent” risk of famine.
Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin set a 30-day deadline for the Israeli government to take action on more than a dozen concrete measures to improve the “deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.”
On Tuesday, a group of eight humanitarian aid organizations jointly said the Israeli government “not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in northern Gaza.”
Blinken and Austin in their letter warned that a “failure to demonstrate a sustained commitment to implementing and maintaining these measures may have implications for US policy” under a Biden administration national security memorandum as well as US law. Section 620I of the US Foreign Assistance Act requires the US to halt security assistance to governments who restrict US humanitarian aid.
“We, at this time, have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of US law,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Tuesday.
Patel said that the Israeli government has taken some of the measures outlined in the letter, and argued that they may not have happened without US pressure.
“We’ve seen some progress being made,” he said at a press briefing. “We would like to see some more changes happen.”
“Most importantly, we are going to continue to watch how these steps that they’ve taken, how they are being implemented, how they can be continued to be expanded on, and through that, we’re going to continue to assess their compliance with US law.”
An Israeli official told CNN earlier on Tuesday that the government has been working to provide humanitarian aid throughout the past year, and “responded positively to most American requests, many of which were already underway regardless.”
‘Worst point since the war began’
However, according to the aid organizations, “the humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated to its worst point since the war began in October 2023.”
There was “non-compliance, significant delays, or backtracking” on 15 of the measures outlined in the Blinken and Austin letter, according to the aid organization’s joint scorecard released Tuesday. There was only “partial or inconsistent implementation” on four of them. None of the measures saw “full or significant progress.”
The scorecard was compiled by Anera, CARE International, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International, and Save the Children. It is “based on the observations and experience of humanitarian organizations on the ground and on available public data and secondary sources.”
The measures that were completely unmet, according to the scorecard, included allowing a minimum of 350 trucks of humanitarian aid per day to enter Gaza and reinstating a minimum of 50-100 commercial trucks per day.
“It’s the sort of lethal combo of no humanitarian assistance and no commercial assistance getting in that is, for the past 30 days, accelerating the deterioration, and that’s a real problem,” said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, the vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps.
“If you’re not having movement on one of those two, then it means that people are not going to have anything to eat. It’s just a very basic equation, right? Nothing to buy, nothing being given, and there’s obviously nothing being really grown or fished or anything locally, and not to mention it wouldn’t ever sustain a population of 2 million,” she told CNN.
They are now receiving reports that “people are not just skipping meals anymore; they’re having a meal once every couple of days, and it’s mostly canned stuff,” she said.
“There’s no fresh food,” Phillips-Barrasso said.
The Israeli government also failed to institute “adequate humanitarian pauses” to allow for humanitarian activities, to rescind “evacuation orders when there is no operational need,” to ensure continuous humanitarian access to northern Gaza, or enhance security for humanitarian sites and movements, according to the scorecard.
According to Israeli authorities and local Palestinian journalists, some humanitarian aid has been delivered to northern Gaza’s Beit Hanoun area in recent days – but many displaced Palestinians there were forced out of their shelters by airstrikes and warnings from the Israeli military to head south before they could receive the aid.
“Israeli forces repeatedly attacked humanitarian sites and frontline responders during the 30-day period,” the scorecard said. “At least 14 aid workers have been killed since October 3, including at least four documented during the 30-day period.”
Moreover, despite US warnings in the letter and elsewhere, the Israeli parliament voted to ban UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. The State Department spokesperson warned last month that the role UNRWA plays in Gaza “cannot be filled by anyone else.”
Calls to halt arms sales
On Tuesday, a group of US officials who resigned in protest at the Biden administration’s policy towards Israel and the war in Gaza called on the US government to halt weapons sales to Israel for violating laws on humanitarian aid.
“We are calling on President Biden to keep this 30-day promise. To uphold US law. To halt US weapons sales to Israel, to stop the spread of the conflict and look out for America,” members of the group said in a video.
“There is no provision in US or international law that allows extra time to starve people,” said former top State Department official Stacy Gilbert.
The humanitarian scorecard noted that “the effectiveness of international diplomatic efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza hinges on the willingness of the United States and other countries to push Israel to comply with these priorities.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/middleeast/netanyahu-strategy-intl/index.html,Netanyahu’s aggressive strategy brings political success and raft of scandal,2024-10-31 00:00:00,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on a winning streak.
From a low point in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 attack, his poll numbers have rebounded. He fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who long threatened his coalition and whose attempted dismissal last year led to massive protests. He has installed allies as foreign and defense ministers, meaning his governing coalition has never been more stable. He passed a law to dismantle the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, long derided by Israel. The White House will soon be home to Donald Trump, with whom Netanyahu has spoken three times in the past week.
He is riding a wave of military success too: The leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah are dead. Gaza is decimated, and Israel controls the Lebanese border. (Rarely mentioned are the more than 43,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry there – the majority of whom the UN says are women and children.)
His victories have been achieved at least partially by a long-standing tactic: delay. He has refused to establish a national commission of inquiry into October 7. He has refused to outline a coherent plan for governance and security in Gaza the day after the war ends. Qatar has withdrawn as mediator with Hamas after accusing both sides of refusing “to engage constructively.”
And Netanyahu continues to be stalked by the scandal that has long followed him through his career. His critics – among whom are prosecutors, investigators and journalists – allege that that success has come through an aggressive and high-stakes strategy, which has led in recent weeks to a raft of new inquiries and revelations.
His lawyers this week asked an Israeli court to delay by 10 weeks a deposition he was set to give in a yearslong corruption case lodged against him. “Over the past two months, it has been almost impossible to hold meetings for the purpose of preparing the Prime Minister for testimony,” his office said in a letter to the court.
An aide has now spent weeks in custody after allegedly leaking manipulated intelligence reports about Hamas to foreign media. In focus, too, is the allegation that Netanyahu’s office has tried to cover up actions taken in the opening hours of October 7, 2023, by altering the minutes of emergency meetings. Journalistic investigations allege that Netanyahu may have had advance warning about Hamas’ attack, and that he shut his defense secretary out of meetings in the days after.
The denials come as quickly as the allegations. “This is another hunting expedition,” his office said. Another report was “mendacious.” A third was “entirely baseless.” Netanyahu himself entered the fray Sunday evening. “In recent days, my office has been under a wild and unchecked attack,” he said in a taped statement. “As I lead this war and deflect international attacks from various arenas, we are now confronting an additional front – the fake news from the media.”
The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that on the eve of Hamas’ October 7 attack, the Prime Minister’s Office was aware that the group was activating Israeli SIM cards for cell phones en masse – suggesting an impeding operation inside Israel. His office called that report a lie “aimed at covering up the serious failures of others on the night of October 7.” (Netanyahu has resisted calls from the likes of Gallant to launch to a state commission of inquiry into October 7 failings, saying it must wait until after the war.)
The left-wing Israeli Ha’aretz newspaper said in an editorial that the slew of revelations “could rival those of a mafia,” and were an attempt to “evade the judgments of the criminal justice system, the public and history.”
“We have tough enemies from the outside,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said in a statement, “but the danger from within the house, and at the heart of the most sensitive decision-making centers, is shaking the foundations of the Israeli public’s trust in the management of the war and in the handling of the most sensitive and volatile security issues.”
Domestic politics dominate the conversation in Israel even as the security chiefs insinuate their work is done – or at least, just about. “Militarily, there is nothing to do in Gaza,” Yoav Gallant told families of hostages still held in Gaza, hours before leaving his post as defense minister, according to Israel’s Channel 13. It is now for the politicians, he said, to lead the next step and bring home 101 hostages.
As Trump was able to do in the United States, the investigations may end up playing to Netanyahu’s advantage, said Nadav Shtrauchler, a political strategist who has worked closely with the prime minister.
“He took this lemon and presented it as lemonade,” he said. “It’s easy to do it,” he explained, because to Netanyahu’s base, the investigations are examples of brazen and selective prosecution. The slate of accusations against the prime minister, he said, are “an opportunity” to brand himself as the victim of a witch hunt. “And this is how he sees it.”
The Prime Minister’s Office argues, in essence, that it’s Netanyahu against the deep state. Israeli media on Sunday reported that Netanyahu boasted during a cabinet meeting: “The beeper operation and the elimination of (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah were launched despite the opposition of senior officials in the security establishment and the political echelon in charge of them.”
It so happens that that was also the first time that Israel acknowledged it was behind the deadly September incident that detonated explosives in thousands of pagers across Lebanon. The attack has already gained cult status in Israel – harkening back to the days when the Mossad staged daring operations around the world.
Israeli media report that Netanyahu would like to further clean house of his political rivals – including the head of the Israel Security Agency (also known as Shin Bet) Ronen Bar and the attorney general, Gali Baharav Miara. The judicial reforms that were stalled last year – and notably opposed by Gallant, the now-former defense minister – remain on the prime minister’s agenda, reports in Israeli media suggest.
It is Baharav Miara who poses among the most serious threats to Netanyahu. The Israeli leader has for years faced three criminal investigations – the most serious of which alleges that he gave regulatory benefits worth up to 1 billion shekels (approximately $280 million) to his friend in exchange for favorable media coverage. Netanyahu has denied any wrong doing.
Reports in Israeli media this week suggest that his office may be floating a trial balloon for dismissing Baharav Miara. A reported conversation about her from Sunday’s cabinet meeting found its way into the press, with one minister saying of the attorney general: “There’s only one answer: fire her.”
After Gallant’s dismissal, Netanyahu’s office said that reports that he plans to fire more people in the security establishment were “incorrect and are designed to sow discord and rifts.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/middleeast/israeli-minister-annexation-occupied-west-bank-intl/index.html,West Bank: Israeli minister calls for preparations to annex settlements,2024-11-11 16:30:09,"Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has ordered preparations for the annexation of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Smotrich, who is in charge of the settlements, said on Monday that he had instructed his department to “prepare the necessary infrastructure for applying sovereignty.”
It is unclear whether his long-standing desire to apply full Israeli law in West Bank settlements has any chance of being implemented soon.
The Prime Minister’s Office is yet to comment on Smotrich’s order. However, earlier Monday, Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s new foreign minister, told a press briefing that the government had made no decision on the issue of annexation as yet, but noted it had been discussed during Donald Trump’s first term as US president and added that “if it will be relevant it will be discussed again with our friends in Washington.”
Observers said Smotrich’s announcement was likely motivated in large part by staking out political ground in Israel’s fractious domestic politics.
Still, it drew swift condemnation from the Palestinian Authority, whose foreign affairs ministry characterized such comments as “a blatantly colonial and racist extension of the ongoing campaign of extermination and forced displacement against the Palestinian people.”
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, the spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority’s presidency, said Smotrich’s comments confirmed “the Israeli government’s intention to finalize its plans for taking control of the West Bank by 2025” and said he held both the “Israeli occupation authorities” and the US administration responsible for allowing Israel to “persist in its crimes, aggression and defiance of international legitimacy and international law.”
Trump victory brings ‘opportunity’
Smotrich told the Knesset, or Israeli parliament, that US President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the US election “brings an important opportunity for the state of Israel.”
The “only way to remove” the “threat” of a Palestinian state, Smotrich added, “is to apply Israeli sovereignty over the entire settlements in Judea and Samaria,” the biblical term by which Israelis refer to the West Bank.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since seizing the territory from Jordan in 1967. In the decades since, it has expanded Jewish settlements in the area, which are considered illegal under international law, despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s.
Around half a million Israelis live in West Bank settlements. Smotrich, himself a settler, has long called for Israeli law to apply in the settlements, and previously opposed the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
The minister said he intends to “lead a government decision” that will allow Israel to “work with the new administration of President Trump and the international community to apply sovereignty and achieve American and international recognition.”
During his first term, Trump took several steps in Israel’s favor. In 2017, he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upending decades of US policy and international consensus. He also recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 war and is also considered occupied under international law.
“I have instructed the Settlement Division in the Ministry of Defense and the Civil Administration to begin professional and comprehensive work to prepare the necessary infrastructure for applying sovereignty,” Smotrich said on Monday.
“In his first term, President Trump led dramatic steps, including… affirming the legality and legitimacy of settlements in Judea and Samaria,” Smotrich added. “Alongside this, there were the Abraham Accords – peace for peace.” Those accords, a set of agreements facilitated by Trump’s first administration, saw Israel normalize relations with four Arab nations.
“We were on the verge of applying sovereignty over the settlements in Judea and Samaria, and now the time has come to do so,” Smotrich said.
Ideas of peace ‘delusional’: Hamas
Hamas, the Palestinian militant group Israel is fighting in the Gaza Strip some 60 miles from the West Bank, seized on Smotrich’s comments, saying they confirmed “the colonial intentions of the occupation” and refuted “the claims of those who are delusional about achieving peace and coexistence” with Israel.
Another militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said it was “tantamount to an admission of the open war waged by the criminal entity against the Palestinian people.”
Israel has been waging its war in Gaza since the Hamas-led terror attack on October 7 that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. Since then, more than 43,500 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip, with the United Nations reporting that most of the dead are women and children.
At the same time, another major escalation of violence has been playing out in the West Bank, where more than 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since the war began, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The attacks are occurring amid a surge in Israeli settler violence across the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem, where some settlers continue a campaign targeting Palestinian civilians and infrastructure.
In both places, the violence shows little sign of abating, with Gaza hospital authorities on Monday reporting dozens of deaths from new strikes across the enclave.
At least 10 people were killed in an Israeli strike on Al Mawasi, west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, according to Nasser hospital officials and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The aid group said the strike hit a cafe housing displaced people.
Multiple strikes in Nuseirat in central Gaza killed at least 20, according to Al Awda hospital, while in Gaza City, an airstrike killed at least two people, according to Al Ahli Baptist hospital officials.
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strikes.
The latest violence comes even as Israeli Foreign Minister Sa’ar suggested at his press briefing Monday that Israel was open to ending its military operations in Gaza. The foreign minister told the briefing that Palestinians would be able to return to their homes in the north when the war ends – though he cautioned this would not happen before Israel’s objectives were achieved.
He also appeared to rule out the possibility of creating a separate Palestinian state, saying this would pose a security threat to Israel. Asked about the possibility, he responded, “in a word: no.”
Meanwhile, Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) leaders meeting in Riyadh for the Arab-Islamic summit condemned Israel’s measures in the occupied West Bank.
In its closing statement, the summit called on the UN Security Council and international community to take action to “stop the escalating illegal Israeli measures in the occupied West Bank that undermine the two-state solution” and to “condemn colonial policies pursued by the occupying power to annex any part of the occupied Palestinian territory by force with the aim of expanding illegal settler colonialism.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/10/middleeast/lebanon-israeli-strikes-intl/index.html,"Lebanon, Gaza and Syria hit by deadly Israeli strikes, reports say",2024-11-09 00:00:00,"More than 80 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon, northern Gaza and Syria since late Saturday, according to reports.
The National News Agency (NNA) reported airstrikes on the town of Almat in central Lebanon on Sunday. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said 20 people were killed there, including three children. Video from the scene shows that at least one building was reduced to rubble, with heavy machinery trying to remove the debris.
The local member of parliament, Simon Abi Ramia, said: “The targeted house belongs to one of the well-known residents of the area, and it is possible that it received displaced people.”
Three people were killed in a strike on Mashghara, a town in south-central Lebanon, and an air raid was carried out on the town of Debaal in the Tyre district of southern Lebanon, the agency added, while “intermittent Israeli artillery shelling continues on the town of Khiam.”
At least 2,513 people have been killed and 11,719 injured in Lebanon since September 16, when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of Lebanese health ministry statements.
The latest strikes follow attacks on more than a dozen separate locations in Lebanon since late Saturday.
The highest number of casualties came in an air strike on what NNA said was a civil defense center affiliated with the Islamic Al-Rissala Scouts Association in the town of Deir Qanoun.
Seventeen people were killed in the strike, NNA said, adding rescue teams were continuing search operations in the rubble. Video from the town showed extensive destruction.
Five people were killed in an airstrike on the town of Hanawaih, and listed strikes on buildings in nearly a dozen other locations. Additionally, artillery shelling hit the towns of Majdal Zoun, Tair Harfa, al-Dhaira, and elsewhere.
The Israeli military said Saturday that airstrikes had been carried out in the areas of Tyre and further north in Baalbek.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said late Saturday that the air force had “eliminated dozens of Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon over the past day.”
The IDF said Sunday that rockets continued to be fired from southern Lebanon. “Approximately ten projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and the rest fell in open areas,” it said. No injuries were reported.
Separately in northern Gaza, at least 41 people died when Israeli strikes hit two homes early on Sunday morning, according to the director general of the Ministry of Health in the enclave.
Dr. Muneer Alboursh said one of the homes was in Jabalya, while the other was in Gaza City. He added that at least half of those killed were children.
International NGO Save the Children said in a post on X that parents, children and grandchildren were among those killed in Israeli strikes on the Jabalya residence.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck “a terrorist infrastructure site in the area of Jabalya” in response to CNN’s request for comment.
“These terrorists posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the area. The details are under review,” the Israeli military said, adding “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of aerial surveillance and precise intelligence” prior to Sunday’s strike.
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the reported strike on the house in Gaza City.
Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said the hospital had received “many distressed calls from people, among them those still trapped under the rubble who we could not assist.”
“The catastrophic conditions continue at Kamal Adwan Hospital in besieged northern Gaza,” Safiya said in a video recorded on Sunday and posted to X by Alboursh.
The reported strikes in Gaza come as a deadline from the United States for Israel to improve humanitarian conditions in the enclave looms. Last month, the Biden administration asked Israel for “urgent and sustained actions” for more aid to enter the strip within the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance.
A World Health Organization report on the availability of food in Gaza concluded Friday that there was “a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip,” where many of the recent Israeli operations have focused.
The report cited UN data that the number of aid shipments into the Gaza Strip was now lower than at any time over the past year.
The Israeli agency that handles the transfer of aid to Gaza rejected the claims, saying such reports in the past “have been systematically based on organizations with vested interests and partial, inaccurate knowledge.”
In Syria, at least seven civilians were killed and 20 injured in an Israeli airstrike targeting a residential building in the Sayyida Zainab area of the Damascus countryside, Syrian state news agency SANA reported Sunday, citing a Syrian regime military source.
SANA said women and children were among those killed and that private properties were damaged.
CNN has contacted the IDF for comment but has not received a response.
Social media videos verified by CNN show damaged buildings in Sayyida Zainab, with rubble strewn across the street. One video filmed from a building shows damage to one of the upper floors of a structure across the street. The video then reveals damage and rubble on the ground floor of the building the video is filmed from.
The Sayyida Zainab area, south of Damascus city, is known to have a Hezbollah presence and has come under Israeli attack in the past. On November 4, SANA reported Israeli strikes in Sayyida Zainab the same day the IDF said Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck Hezbollah intelligence infrastructure in the Damascus area.",['Lauren Said-Moorhouse'],en

The Israeli media on Sunday reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet: “The beeper operation and the elimination of (Hezbollah’s leader Hassan) Nasrallah were launched despite the opposition of senior officials in the security establishment and the political echelon in charge of them.”
An Israeli official confirmed those remarks to CNN – the first time Israel has acknowledged its role.
The decision by the government to brief Israel’s media on Netanyahu’s remarks – and by extension, confirm Israel was behind the operation – appears to be another chapter in the domestic political machinations that have dominated Israel in recent weeks.
Israeli media interpreted the phrasing as implicit criticism of Israel’s military leadership and intelligence establishment, as well as then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, whom Netanyahu fired on Tuesday.
The Israeli government is facing multiple criminal probes, including over allegedly leaking falsified intelligence reports to the international media.
The Prime Minister’s Office denies wrongdoing.
On September 17, thousands of explosions struck Hezbollah members, targeting their pagers and then walkie-talkies a day later. The blasts killed at least 37 people, including some children, and injured nearly 3,000, many of them civilian bystanders, according to Lebanese health authorities, many of them civilian bystanders.
The day after pagers began exploding across Lebanon, Gallant seemed to acknowledge his country’s role.
“The IDF brings excellent achievements, together with the Shin Bet, together with Mossad, all the bodies and all the frameworks and the results are very impressive results,” he said on September 18, during a visit to the Ramat-David Air Force base in northern Israel.
‘Very good’ talks with Trump
The acknowledgment of the pager attacks came as Netanyahu said he had spoken three times in recent days with US President-elect Donald Trump.
Speaking ahead of a cabinet meeting Sunday, Netanyahu said: “These were very good and very important conversations, aimed at strengthening the solid alliance between Israel and the United States.”
He added: “We see eye-to-eye on the Iranian threat in all its aspects and the danger it poses. We also see the great opportunities before Israel – in peace and expansion, and in other areas.”
Netanyahu also referred to events in the Netherlands last week, when Israeli football fans were subjected to antisemitic abuse and violence.
“We will never allow the horrors of history to repeat. We will never surrender — to neither antisemitism nor terrorism,” Netanyahu said.
“A clear line connects the two recent antisemitic attacks against Israel on Dutch soil: the criminal legal attack on the State of Israel in the International Court of Justice (sic) in The Hague, and the violent criminal attack against Israeli citizens on the streets of Amsterdam,” Netanyahu said.
In May, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (not the ICJ) applied for arrest warrants against both Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, saying they bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Netanyahu added: “We will continue to defend our country and our citizens on all fronts, against every threat, with the Iranian threat at the forefront.”
On Sunday, Israel advised its citizens to avoid attending sports and cultural events involving Israelis outside of the country following the attacks in Amsterdam.
In a public advisory alert, Israel’s National Security Council (NSC) warned of alleged calls to “harm Israelis and Jews, under the guise of protests and demonstrations, exploiting gathering events (such as sports and cultural events) to maximize harm and media exposure.”
The NSC suggested that these planned attacks could take place in Belgium, the United Kingdom, and France. It told Israelis to particularly avoid the upcoming France-Israel soccer match in Paris on Thursday.
Israelis have also been warned to stay away from protests and demonstrations and to “take extra care to conceal identifying Israeli/Jewish symbols.”",['Eugenia Yosef'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/09/middleeast/qatar-mediation-israel-hamas-intl/index.html,Qatar is suspending its role in talks between Israel and Hamas,2024-11-09 18:10:56,"Qatar is suspending its role as a mediator in talks between Israel and Hamas after concluding that the two sides are no longer negotiating in good faith, its foreign ministry said Saturday.
Qatar, which has hosted Hamas’ political office in Doha since 2012, has alongside Egypt served as an intermediary for the two sides, which do not officially maintain direct contact.
A diplomatic source briefed on the matter told CNN that the Qatari government made the decision after concluding that both sides are now refusing “to engage constructively.”
“The State of Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,” Majed Al-Ansari, the spokesperson for the Qatari Foreign Ministry, said in a statement Saturday.
Except for a brief flurry of activity last month, there have been no real negotiations since six Israeli hostages were executed by Hamas and discovered in a Gaza tunnel at the end of August. During a temporary ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Egypt last November, Hamas released 105 hostages and Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners.
“The Qataris have concluded that there is insufficient willingness from either side, with the mediation efforts becoming more about politics and PR rather than a serious attempt to secure peace, save the hostages and Palestinian civilians,” the diplomatic source told CNN. “As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose.”
A separate diplomatic source told CNN that Hamas’ political office in Doha “⁠won’t be operational so (Hamas) may leave. The office could open again if talks restart.”
Hamas has insisted that any agreement with Israel must lead to a permanent end to the war in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused that demand. In July he effectively spiked a draft hostage and ceasefire deal by introducing a raft of new, 11th-hour demands.
There are 101 hostages still held in Gaza. Israel’s military campaign, launched in response to Hamas’ October 7 attack, has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health; the UN reported that 70% of the fatalities in the first six months of the conflict were women and children.
The Israeli minister of economy, Nir Barkat, appeared to offer the first official Israeli reaction to the move, saying on X that “Qatar was never a mediator, but Hamas’ defender, the one to fund and protect the terrorist organization.” Netanyahu for years backed payments to Hamas through Qatar, in order to divide Palestinian politics and – detractors allege – prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.
It is not the first time the Qatari government has expressed frustration – particularly with insinuations that it was too close to Hamas. In April, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said that Qatar’s efforts were being misused for “narrow political interests” by some involved in the conflict, “which required the state of Qatar to conduct a comprehensive evaluation” of its role.
The Qatari government has now told the Biden administration that it is willing to restart its mediation efforts “when both sides reach an impasse and demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table with the objective of putting an end to the war and the suffering of civilians.”
A senior American official told CNN that while Qatar had played “an invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal” last year, “following Hamas’ repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.”",['Becky Anderson'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/europe/israel-soccer-fans-attacked-amsterdam-intl-hnk/index.html,Amsterdam bans protests for three days following violent attacks on Israeli soccer fans,2024-11-08 03:31:50,"Amsterdam has banned demonstrations for three days after Israeli soccer fans were beaten and injured in violent clashes in the city overnight, which Dutch authorities condemned Friday as antisemitic.
Dutch police said they had launched a major investigation into multiple incidents following the Europa League soccer game Thursday night between Israel’s Maccabi Tel Aviv and Dutch side Ajax.
Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said criminals on scooters searched the city in search of Maccabi supporters in “hit-and-run” attacks. “This is a terrible moment for our city … I am very ashamed of the behavior that was shown last night,” she said in a Friday news conference.
Tensions had been rising in the lead-up to Thursday night’s match with multiple social media videos showing Maccabi fans chanting anti-Arab slurs, praising Israeli military attacks in Gaza and yelling “f**k the Arabs.” Other videos apparently filmed in Amsterdam show men ripping Palestinian flags off buildings. It is unclear when those videos were filmed.
Amsterdam authorities said Friday morning that five injured Israeli soccer fans have since been released from the hospital, and 20 to 30 other people were lightly injured. In total, 63 individuals were arrested and 10 remain in custody, police said.
Amsterdam has implemented several additional security measures in the wake of Thursday’s unrest. A ban on demonstrations in the city was implemented on Friday and will be in place for three days until Sunday, according to Halsema. There will also be a bolstered police presence.
The mayor also announced a ban on “face-covering clothing” and “carrying objects” that could lead to disturbances of public order.
The mayor added she wanted the city to be safe for Israeli soccer supporters, safe for locals and “especially safe for our Jewish residents.”
After the game, hundreds of Maccabi fans “were ambushed and attacked,” the Israeli embassy to the United States said on social media platform X, sharing video of the violence.
One video shows a man being kicked while he lies on the ground, while another video shows a man being hit by a man yelling “free Palestine” and “for the children, motherf***er.” CNN has not yet been able to verify those videos.
Another video shows a man shouting “I am not Jewish” as he is chased down the street, thrown to the ground and beaten.
Police have said the atmosphere at the stadium was relatively calm and fans left without incident after Ajax won the game 5-0, but during the night various clashes in the city center were reported.
The mayor added: “There can be tensions there are many demonstrations and protests and we are always prepared for them, and of course, they are related to the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing war. But what happened last night wasn’t a protest. … It was crime.”
“There is no excuse for the antisemitic behavior exhibited last night by rioters who actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them,” local authorities in Amsterdam said Friday, adding that police intervened several times to protect fans and escort them to hotels.
Police earlier said they had boosted their presence in the city center on Wednesday night, citing “tensions” in several areas, one day ahead of the game.
Officers “prevented a confrontation between a group of taxi drivers and a group of visitors who came from the adjacent casino” on Wednesday, the police said in a statement on X, noting another incident, in which a Palestinian flag was torn down in Amsterdam’s center by unknown perpetrators.
On Thursday, pro-Palestinian demonstrators tried to reach the Johan Cruyff stadium, though the city had forbidden them to protest there, Reuters reported.
Kobi Elyahu, an Israeli soccer fan returning to Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport on Friday evening, described the attacks against Israelis as “very frightening” and “like the 1940s.” He described seeing people locking themselves in hotels to escape, people throwing water and others “driving” and “stepping on” victims.
Most fans were subdued on their arrival in Tel Aviv. “It’s not a nice experience - it’s a bad experience,” one man said. “We go to Amsterdam for a vacation and a game. We never think that it will be this situation.”
Some fans showed up to greet the returnees, shouting racist chants: “Let IDF win, we will f**k the Arabs. Ole, ole, ole. In Gaza there’s no schooling, there’s no children left there.”
Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof called the attacks “terrible” and “horrific,” while talking to journalists on Friday.
“There are always problems around football matches, and football matches regarding the Israeli team also has special attention from the police, but the things that happened last night are just terrible, horrific,” he said, before adding that he was “utterly ashamed” that this had happened in the Netherlands.
“This is completely unacceptable. I am in close contact with all parties involved and have just spoken to (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu by phone to stress that the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted,” he said, adding: “The situation in Amsterdam is now calm once more.”
Netanyahu on Friday received a briefing from the country’s Foreign Ministry regarding efforts to return Israeli citizens from Amsterdam. During the meeting, Netanyahu compared the antisemitic attacks on Israeli soccer fans to Kristallnacht, or the “Night of Broken Glass,” when the Nazi regime attacked Jewish-owned businesses, synagogues and homes throughout Germany in 1938.
“Tomorrow, 86 years ago, was Kristallnacht - an attack on Jews, whatever Jews they are, on European soil. It’s back now - yesterday we celebrated it on the streets of Amsterdam. That’s what happened. There is only one difference - in the meantime, the Jewish state has been established. We have to deal with it,” Netanyahu said, according to a government statement.
In a separate statement from his office, Netanyahu urged Dutch authorities to “act firmly and quickly against the rioters and ensure the peace of our citizens.” Israel also organized evacuation flights on commercial aircraft for some Israeli citizens.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar traveled to the Netherlands in the wake of the attacks, which he condemned as “barbaric and antisemitic” and called “a blaring alarm call for Europe and the world.”
Following a meeting with top Dutch officials on Friday, Sa’ar highlighted that Israel expected criminal proceedings against Thursday’s perpetrators. “We expect arrests, we expect a severe punishment,” Sa’ar said in a statement.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was shocked by the violence in Amsterdam, adding that he condemns all forms of antisemitism and anti-Muslim bigotry, UN spokesperson Stephanie Tremblay said during a Friday news briefing.
The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said in a statement Friday that it “condemns anti-Arab chants by Israelis and attacks on the symbolism of the Palestinian flag in Amsterdam,” and also called on the Dutch government to “protect Palestinians and Arabs in the Netherlands.”
The Palestine Football Association also issued a statement saying it is “gravely concerned by the sequence of violent events in Amsterdam,” accusing Maccabi Tel Aviv fans of “incitement to violence, anti-Palestinian racism, and Islamophobia.”
Israel’s National Security Council urged citizens to avoid affiliated basketball team Maccabi Tel Aviv’s Friday night game against Virtus Bologna in Italy.
The Israeli foreign ministry is reviewing security for Israelis living abroad and for all future Israeli team sporting events in Europe, including enhancing cooperation with local authorities, an Israeli official told CNN.
Following the Amsterdam incident, some people in France have called for next week’s match between the French and Israeli national soccer teams to be relocated.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/09/middleeast/un-warnings-gaza-humanitarian-conditions-intl/index.html,"Around 70% of deaths in Gaza are women and children, says UN",2024-11-07 00:00:00,"Several United Nations agencies are again sounding the alarm on the rapid deterioration of humanitarian conditions in much of Gaza and the civilian toll of more than a year of Israeli military operations.
In a detailed report verifying fatalities in Gaza in the first six months of the conflict, the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it “found close to 70 per cent to be children and women, indicating a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law” on the part of the Israeli military.
The continuation of these attacks “demonstrates an apparent indifference to the death of civilians and the impact of the means and methods of warfare selected,” the report said.
It added that of the confirmed deaths, 80% were killed in residential buildings or similar housing, of which 44% were children and 26% were women.
OHCHR said it found a pattern showing “high numbers of babies and young children, women, older persons, and families killed together in residential buildings.”
UN Human Rights chief Volker Türk said the report showed that civilian casualties were “a direct consequence of the failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law – namely the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack.”
He said that pattern continued “unabated, over one year after the start of the war.”
CNN has approached the Israeli government for a response to the OHCHR report.
The UN children’s agency, UNICEF, said Friday that “at least 64 attacks against schools – almost two every day – were registered in the Gaza Strip last month.”
An estimated 128 people were reportedly killed in the strikes, many of them children, it added.
UNICEF said that, according to the latest estimates, nearly half of the attacks recorded in October happened in northern Gaza, “where renewed intense bombardments, mass displacement, and lack of sufficient aid are pushing children to the brink.”
The Israeli military has persistently alleged that Hamas uses schools and other facilities for displaced civilians as a cover for its operations.
UNICEF also said since the onset of hostilities more than 95% of schools in Gaza have been partially or completely destroyed.
A World Health Organization report on the availability of food in Gaza concluded Friday that there was “a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip,” where many of the recent Israeli operations have focused.
“Starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing in these areas. Famine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future,” it said.
The report cited UN data that the number of aid shipments into the Gaza Strip was now lower than at any time over the past year. It said monitoring by the World Food Programme showed that in the second half of October the average number of trucks entering the Gaza Strip fell to just 58 per day, the lowest level since November last year.
Before the war began, around 500 commercial and aid trucks were entering Gaza each day.
The WHO report also said the price of food in Gaza had risen by 312% since the beginning of the conflict.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Saturday that the report was “deeply alarming.” In a post on X, he said: “We call for an immediate scale-up and safe access for humanitarian aid — primarily food and medicines for severe malnutrition — within days not weeks.”
The Israeli agency that handles the transfer of aid to Gaza rejected the report warning of the prospect of famine in northern Gaza, saying such reports in the past “have been systematically based on organizations with vested interests and partial, inaccurate knowledge.”
In a statement to CNN, COGAT said the Israel Defense Forces “has repeatedly called on residents of northern Gaza to move away from high-intensity combat zones. Concurrent with the humanitarian response for the north, an extensive and evolving humanitarian effort is underway for central and southern Gaza.”
It added: “The IDF, via COGAT, operates in accordance with international law and continues to facilitate and ease the transfer of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Over the past two months, 39,000 trucks carrying over 840,000 tons of food have entered the Gaza Strip.”",[],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/qatar-hamas-doha-us-request/index.html,"Qatar agrees to kick Hamas out of Doha following US request, sources say",2024-11-08 23:26:35,"Qatar agreed in recent weeks to kick Hamas out of its country following a request from the US to do so, capping off months of failed attempts to try to get the militant group – whose top leaders reside in the Qatari capital of Doha – to accept a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Israel-Hamas war, US and Qatari sources told CNN.
With efforts to pause the war – which has been a top priority for President Joe Biden – firmly stalled, US officials informed their Qatari counterparts about two weeks ago that they must stop giving Hamas refuge in their capital; Qatar agreed and gave Hamas notice about a week ago, sources said.
“Hamas is a terrorist group that has killed Americans and continues to hold Americans hostage,” a senior administration official told CNN. “After rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner.”
A senior Hamas official said reports of Qatar agreeing to expel Hamas officials from Doha were “baseless” and a “pressure tactic,” adding that similar claims have been previously circulated without supporting evidence.
“What was reported in the Israeli media about Qatar agreeing to expel Hamas from Doha following a US request has no basis and is merely a pressure tactic. This has been repeated without any evidence,” the Hamas official told CNN on Saturday.
Throughout the course of the war and negotiations to bring the hostages home, US officials have asked Qatar to use the threat of expulsion as leverage in their talks with Hamas. The final impetus for Qatar agreeing to kick Hamas out came recently after the death of American-Israeli hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Hamas’ rejection of yet another ceasefire proposal.
Qatar has been a major player in efforts over the past year to try to secure a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, in no small part because senior members of the militant group are based in Doha. Major negotiations have taken place in the Qatari capital for that reason.
Exactly when Hamas operatives would be exiled out of Qatar – and where they would go – are unclear. One US official told CNN the group has not been given an extended amount of time to leave the country. While Turkey is seen as a possible option, the US is not likely to approve of that scenario for the same reasons that it does not want Qatar to give refuge to Hamas leadership.
Earlier this year, the Justice Department charged several senior Hamas leaders over the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel. At least one of those defendants, Khaled Meshaal, is believed to be residing in Qatar.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also told Qatar over the summer to warn Hamas that if the group did not agree to halt the war in Gaza, they would risk getting kicked out of Doha.

The students, two men in their 20s, were assaulted by unknown assailants who struck one victim in the face and body and pushed the other one to the ground before running off, the Chicago Police Department said, adding both declined emergency medical aid.
Police are investigating the assault as a hate crime, the department said Thursday. “The offender verbally engaged the victim and made anti-Semitic remarks before repeatedly striking the victim,” the police said
“We are outraged that this occurred on our campus,” the university’s president, Robert L. Manuel, said in a statement. “It is completely unacceptable and a violation of DePaul’s values to uphold and care for the dignity of every individual.”
Authorities also released several images of two men, described as persons of interest in their 20s, and are seeking the public’s assistance in identifying them. The police did not say whether the assailants wore masks.
The university is actively working with the Chicago Police Department to investigate the incident, Manuel said.
The incident, which was initially classified as simple battery, took place on the university’s Lincoln Park campus.
How the victims were showing support for Israel was not immediately clear.
The campus witnessed tensions earlier this year when authorities dismantled a student-led encampment in May, following over two weeks of demonstrations calling for the university’s divestment from companies with ties to Israel. The encampment was one of the last remaining encampments in the Chicago area at a time when college campuses across the US were experiencing such protests, according to CNN affiliate WLS.
Wednesday’s incident comes as tensions in the Middle East rage on, with Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza yielding a dire humanitarian crisis while stoking global advocacy from supporters of Israel and Palestinians, many in support of a ceasefire.
It follows an alleged hate crime incident in nearby West Rogers Park, where a suspect has been charged in an attack last month on a Jewish man en route to a synagogue.
Threats to Jews in the United States tripled in the year after the deadly October 7 terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas, preliminary data provided to CNN by the Anti-Defamation League shows. The Council on American-Islamic Relations got 8,061 reports of anti-Muslim bias in 2023, the highest number in the 28 years the group has tracked hate, it said in April.
“We will do all we can to hold those responsible accountable for this outrageous incident,” the DePaul president said Wednesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/middleeast/israel-france-consulate-staff-detained-jerusalem-intl-hnk/index.html,Israel-France tensions deepen as Paris says consulate staff briefly detained by police in Jerusalem,2024-11-08 04:51:58,"France condemned the brief detention of two consulate members after it said Israeli police forced their way into a French-owned holy site in Jerusalem, in what is the latest diplomatic spat in a series of events that have sent relations between the two plummeting.
France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot was due to visit the French-owned Eleona church compound, which houses a sanctuary, on Thursday when the incident occurred.
Armed Israeli officers entered the site without authorization, France’s Foreign Ministry said, arresting the two consulate staff members “despite the fact that they are officials with diplomatic status” and prompting Barrot to abandon his visit.
The employees were later released following the intervention of the minister, France’s Foreign Ministry statement said.
In a separate statement, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said an argument arose between Israeli security forces and two French security guards “who refused to identify themselves.”
“The two were detained by the police and released immediately after identifying themselves as diplomats,” it said, adding that the Israeli security officers were accompanying the foreign minister on his official visit.
Video obtained by CNN showed two police officers attempting to detain one of the French men as he repeatedly says, “Don’t touch me,” before being forced to the ground, apprehended and ushered into a police car.
The Eleona church compound on the Mount of Olives is one of four French-owned sites in Jerusalem that make up the French national domain in the Holy Land and is administered by French authorities.
France’s Foreign Ministry said it would summon Israel’s ambassador in the coming days.
“This violation of the integrity of a site under French responsibility risks weakening the ties I had come to nurture with Israel at a time when we all need to move forward in the region on the path to peace,” Barrot told reporters while in Jerusalem.
Barrot was meeting with Israeli officials on Thursday where he urged for diplomatic solutions to end the wars in Gaza and Lebanon amid repeated calls for a ceasefire, following spiraling international alarm over huge civilian casualties over the last year.
The visit comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries following calls by French President Emmanuel Macron to end arms exports to Israel for use in Gaza.
Relations between Israel and France, as well as other European countries, which had been initially strained over Gaza, have further deteriorated since Israel’s ground operation against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
European nations, including France, have expressed outrage over Israeli military strikes at posts of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL. Israel said it has no intention of harming the UN’s peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon but accused Hezbollah of using UNIFIL personnel as human shields.
Macron slammed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month of “sowing barbarism” in remarks at a conference convened by the French president to support the Lebanese people and military.
The French government also attempted to ban Israeli weapons firms from exhibiting at a trade fair in Paris later this month, which was later reversed by a French court, Reuters reported.
In recent years, there have been several incidents between French officials and Israeli security officers at French-administered sites in Jerusalem.
In 2020, Macron was involved in an altercation with Israeli security officers while visiting the Church of Saint Anne, another territory it owns, where he was seen shouting “I don’t like what you did in front of me.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/middleeast/jabalya-gaza-israel-strike-intl/index.html,"Israeli attacks kill dozens across Gaza, including 27 in one strike",2024-11-07 16:59:22,"An Israeli airstrike on a multi-story building in northern Gaza killed at least 27 people, relief officials said, as the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders in the area, where it is mounting a major offensive.
The home of the Mbahouh family in Jabalya was struck on Thursday afternoon, according to the spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal.
He said the four-story property was sheltering more than 50 displaced people, and some had been trapped in a warehouse at the bottom of the building.
CNN is reaching out to the Israeli military on the target of the strike.
Also on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike hit Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City. Another killed at least four people in Al-Rimal School, west of Gaza City, Basal said.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the airstrike on Al-Shati refugee camp and claimed the school was used as a “command and control center” by Hamas. The IDF said it not comment on the second attack without coordinates.
The Israeli military campaign in Gaza since the October 7 Hamas-led attacks has demolished entire neighborhoods and rendered large swathes of the strip uninhabitable.
At least 43,469 Palestinians have been killed and another 102,561 people injured in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health there.
Human rights agencies warned of “apocalyptic” survival challenges for Palestinians trapped in Jabalya, home to a large refugee camp, where the Israeli military ramped up aerial and ground attacks in early October that it says are targeting Hamas’ renewed presence in the area.
The UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians, accused Israel of “making Palestinian survival in northern Gaza impossible as part of a policy of sustained pressure and forcible expulsion,” in a statement to CNN on Monday.
Israeli airstrikes and shelling reportedly killed at least 30 other people in Gaza since Wednesday. Most of those Palestinians were killed by Israeli attacks in the Beit Lahiya area of northern Gaza.
An Israeli airstrike struck a residential building in the Mashrou’ neighborhood of Beit Lahiya, killing six people and injuring several others, journalists and medics say, who added that a further six people were killed in second strike in the same area. Four others were killed in a separate drone strike in Beit Lahiya, they said.
In addition, six people had been killed, according to local journalists, as a result of Israeli artillery shelling west of Jabalya camp in northern Gaza.
The head of field hospitals in Gaza, Dr. Marwan Al-Hams, told CNN Thursday that the “health situation in the north is more than catastrophic… Three hospitals in the north of the Strip are out of service, and we cannot perform surgeries.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that “troops started to operate in the area of Beit Lahiya following prior intelligence information and a situational assessment indicating the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure.”
The IDF said it also continues operations in Jabalya in northern Gaza and had killed some “50 terrorists” over the past day.
‘A new Nakba’
An aid worker displaced in Gaza City recounted the mental anguish of being uprooted from one neighborhood to another, after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders to Palestinians in northern Gaza on Thursday.
Mahmoud Shalabi, the deputy director of programmes for MAP, said he has been forced to flee at least seven times since October 2023 – including from northern Gaza to Gaza City. Shalabi’s testimony was shared with CNN by MAP.
“I am really unsure whether I will be able to see my home again. And even if I am allowed to go back, will our homes remain as they are?” he said on Thursday. “It’s as if it’s a new Nakba.
“We are being forced to flee from our homes under brutal force,” he added. “My three children keep asking me, ‘When are we going to return back home?’ And I really can’t answer that question.
“To exist on this land is to resist,” said Shalabi. “I will not leave. I want to live a dignified life.”
The military’s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, posted on X a demand that residents leave several areas of northern Gaza, saying that “once again, terrorist organizations are launching rocket attacks toward the state of Israel.”
Adraee said that the “specified area has been warned multiple times previously. We inform you that the specified area is considered a dangerous combat zone, so for your safety, move south immediately.”
Elsewhere, in central Gaza, according to a CNN stringer at the scene, Civil Defense said it had recovered eight bodies after a strike in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on Wednesday night.
A male witness, Salim Mohammed Alaa Abu Najeh, told CNN that his sister’s home was targeted.
“They were at home when suddenly a missile hit their building… They have no connection to any organizations or anything like that. They were unarmed, poor people with difficult circumstances, who struggled to build this home.”
Among those in the building were orphans who had been raised by their grandmother, Abu Najeh said.
CNN has asked the IDF about the target of the attack.
Israeli operations also continue in southern Gaza, where the IDF said Thursday that a “number of armed terrorists” had been killed in the Rafah area.
The Palestine Red Crescent said paramedics had transferred five bodies to hospital as a result of an Israeli drone attack in the Al-Janina neighborhood, east of Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip. Journalists said four of those killed were from the same family.
Additionally, they said, two people were killed in a strike launched from an Israeli military quadcopter.","['Mohammad Al Sawalhi', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Kareem Khadder', 'Eyad Kourdi', 'Tim Lister']",en

During his first four years, Trump made history by selecting Saudi Arabia for his first foreign trip, attempted to broker a “deal of the century” between Israelis and Palestinians, strengthened the Jewish state’s regional integration, and significantly intensified pressure on Iran.
But the Middle East has changed significantly since he left office in 2021, and all regional actors are keenly watching how the new president will navigate these shifts.
“Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on X on Wednesday.
Gulf Arab states also welcomed the president-elect’s victory. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman congratulated Trump, and the United Arab Emirates said: “the UAE and US are united by our enduring partnership based on shared ambitions for progress.”
Iran downplayed the significance of the election, saying there is “no significant difference” in who becomes president in the US, state media reported. Fatemeh Mohajerani, spokesperson for the government, was cited by Iranian media as saying that the “general policies of the US and Iran are unchanged” after Wednesday’s ballot.
Here’s how Trump’s election could affect key players in the Middle East:
Israel and the Palestinians
Ending the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and integrating Israel in the Middle East are likely to be at the top of the president-elect’s Middle East agenda, analysts said.
“Netanyahu will face a much tougher president than he is used to in the sense that I don’t think that Trump would tolerate the wars in the manner that they are happening,” said Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, adding that for Palestinians, it won’t make a major difference “because both administrations were totally biased” toward Israel.
Trump doesn’t want those wars “on his desk as a burning issue” come January 20, when he is inaugurated, Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, told CNN.
“He will say: wrap it up; I don’t need this,” Pinkas said, adding that Trump will likely ask the Israeli prime minister to “announce victory” and then strike a deal through mediators.
Throughout his campaign, Trump has not specified how he would approach the Israel-Hamas war if reelected, or how his policies would differ from predecessor Joe Biden’s. In April, Trump did say that Israel needs to “finish what they started” and “get it over with fast,” noting that it was “losing the PR war” because of the images coming out of Gaza.
Trump, Pinkas said, “couldn’t care less about the Palestinian issue.” During his first term, he didn’t throw his weight behind the US’ longstanding support for an independent Palestinian state, saying he would like the solution “that both parties like.”
There is fear, said Barghouti, that Trump may allow Israel to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which would spell “the end of the two-state solution.”
During his first term, Trump took several steps in Israel’s favor. In 2017, he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upending decades of US policy and international consensus. He also recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 war.
But while Trump has often claimed to be most pro-Israel president in modern history, and even touted his close and personal relationship with Netanyahu, ties between the two leaders haven’t always been friendly.
In 2021, when both were out of office, Trump accused Netanyahu of betrayal when the Israeli leader congratulated Biden on winning the presidency in 2020.
Shortly after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel last year, Trump criticized Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence services for being unprepared, claiming the attack would not have occurred if he was president.
Boaz Bismuth, a member of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, from Netanyahu’s Likud party, told CNN that Trump’s election came at “the right time” as it would provide an opportunity to expand the Abraham Accords as the wars in Gaza and Lebanon are coming to an end.
The accords, a set of agreements facilitated by Trump’s first administration that saw Israel normalize relations with four Arab nations, put prospects of an independent Palestinian state on the back burner, he said.
“When the war will be over, you’ll need a real restart in the Middle East,” and Trump will be the best person to bring about a “new Middle East,” Bismuth added.
Nadav Shtrauchler, a political strategist who has worked closely with Netanyahu, said Trump’s election sends a message to Israel’s enemies in Iran.
The Israeli prime minister is also likely emboldened domestically, a day after he fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant after months of clashes over domestic politics and Israel’s war efforts.
“He’ll calculate his next moves maybe different from he would if Harris was elected,” Shtrauchler said, adding that Trump’s unpredictability could mean that there will be more pressure on Israel to end the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, potentially to refocus efforts at confronting Iran.
Iran
The next four years could be the Islamic Republic’s biggest test since its founding in 1979, with Tehran under Trump’s scrutiny that would most likely lead to a return of the “maximum pressure” campaign he imposed during his last presidency, which increased Iran’s isolation and crippled its economy, experts say.
Trump, who prides himself as a master dealmaker, failed to contain Tehran’s influence in the Middle East despite withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear agreement to curtail Iran’s nuclear program, reimposing sanctions on it, and even ordering the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the military commander who oversaw ties with Iran’s proxies in the region.
Since Trump left office in 2020, Iran has ramped up enrichment of uranium, increased its oil exports, stepped up support for regional militant groups, and has set a precedent by striking Israel in a direct attack twice.
But as Israel continues to degrade Tehran’s regional capabilities by striking its proxies, Iran finds itself losing its deterring powers as it faces economic turmoil and widespread internal discontent.
“The Islamic Republic appears as fragile as the threats against it are formidable,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project and senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, adding that 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has limited bandwidth to be dealing with all the crises happening at the same time.
As the Middle East teeters on the brink of a wider war, with Iran threatening to respond to an Israeli attack on its territory this month, there are concerns that Trump’s election may empower Netanyahu to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, something the Biden administration warned against.
“There is one scenario that Trump will tell Netanyahu to finish the job before he formally takes over, that means we might see a sharp escalation in tensions in November and December – Israel trying to push its advantage to weaken Iran and its Axis of Resistance (of militant groups) before Trump comes to office… then Trump comes in and takes credit on being a peacemaker,” Vaez said.
That could change if the Biden administration decides to “pull the plug” on Israel’s ability to escalate tensions in its final months in office, he said. The US has already laid the ground for that by sending a letter to Israel last month warning of repercussions if Israel does not improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
An important factor in Iran’s relationship with the next US president will be how Trump responds to recent US intelligence reports suggesting that Tehran attempted to assassinate him – allegations Iran dismissed as “unsubstantiated and malicious.”
But there must be a clear distinction between Trump and the Trump administration, said Vaez.
“Trump might be attracted by the allure of outwitting the Iranians at the negotiation table because that for him would be the ultimate test of his mastery in the art of the deal,” he said, adding that during his first term, he was attracted to the prospect of dealmaking with Iran.
“Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!” Trump wrote in a tweet in 2020.
Vaez noted that a revival of Trump’s “maximum pressure” approach might be paired with a policy of “maximum support” for Iranian people – a potential regime changing policy. This, he argued, would make it unlikely for the two countries to return to the negotiating table.
“I don’t think anyone in (Trump’s) national security team would share the objective of reaching a mutually beneficial deal with the Iranian regime,” he added.
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states
Anticipating his possible comeback, Gulf Arab states continued to engage with Trump after he left office. Analysts say that could prove fruitful for them.
Relations between Saudi Arabia and the US under Trump’s first term flourished. He made history by choosing Riyadh for his first foreign visit as president in 2017 and stood by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the crisis surrounding the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents in 2018, when the Saudi heir faced global isolation.
“Gulf states place a lot of premium on the ability to work with a likeminded leader and conduct relations through interpersonal contact… It reflects the way they do business with other countries as well,” said Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain.
During his first term, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were engaged in wars in Yemen, and both countries’ ties with Iran were at their worst in decades.
But Gulf states have significantly modified their foreign policies since, opting to limit their military interventions and reach out to former foes like Iran, while diversifying alliances in an increasingly multipolar world amid skepticism over the US’ role in the Middle East.
“With Iran, there is a chance that Trump reverts to a maximum pressure stance and given the improved relations with Iran (Gulf states) could be subjected to greater pressure from the US to abide by the maximum pressure,” Alhasan said.
One challenge that emerging middle-powers like Saudi Arabia and the UAE could face under Trump will be managing their closer relationship with China. Over the past years, the oil-producing states have expanded trade and technology ties with China despite competition between Washington and Beijing.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE were invited to join the BRICS group of developing nations, and Saudi Arabia was granted dialogue partner status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) – a China-led Asian security and economic bloc.
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have used Chinese technology for key infrastructure, and despite pledges to limit Beijing’s influence on their emerging artificial intelligence sectors, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have increasingly relied on Chinese expertise.
“It’s a question of whether the Trump administration will exert greater pressure on Gulf states to decouple from China in certain areas, not to mention the tariff and trade wars that are likely to be exacerbated under a Trump administration which could have an impact on (Gulf) exports as well,” Alhasan said.
Trump also hopes to expand Israel’s integration in the Middle East but may face a challenge in Saudi Arabia’s refusal to normalize relations with the Jewish state until it sees a pathway for Palestinian statehood, which Israel has refused.
Qatar, one of the first nations to congratulate Trump, has become indispensable to US efforts in reaching a ceasefire in Gaza due to its relations with Hamas. Those relations may however prove to be a liability under Trump, according to Alhasan.
“They’re probably quite worried about what a Trump 2.0 might be,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/middleeast/netanyahu-yoav-gallant-intl-latam/index.html,"Netanyahu fires Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after months of clashes over war and politics",2024-11-05 18:09:12,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant after months of clashes over domestic politics and Israel’s war efforts.
In a recorded statement Tuesday evening, Netanyahu said that “trust between me and the minister of defense has cracked.”
Israel Katz, currently the foreign minister, will become defense minister. Gideon Sa’ar will replace Katz as foreign minister, the prime minister’s office said Tuesday. Neither has extensive military experience, though Katz has served in the cabinet throughout the war.
The move came as voters in the United States, Israel’s most important ally, voted for their next president. Gallant is a close interlocutor for the US administration, and has been said to have daily conversations with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
The reshuffle happened at a crucial moment for Israel, which is fighting bloody wars in Gaza and Lebanon while awaiting a potential retaliatory attack from Iran.
Gallant responded to the decision shortly after it was made public, posting on X that the “security of Israel has been and will always be my lifelong mission.” In a televised statement, he said his dismissal was the result of a dispute over three things: the issue of ultra-Orthodox military service, the abandonment of hostages in Gaza, and the need for an official inquiry into Hamas’ October 7 attack.
“There isn’t and won’t be forgiveness for abandoning the hostages,” he said. “This will be a ‘mark of Cain’ that the Israeli society bears, as well as those leading through this wrong path.”
Netanyahu said Tuesday he had “made many attempts” to bridge differences with Gallant, but that they “kept widening” and “came to the public’s knowledge in an unacceptable manner.” He continued: “Worse than that, they came to the knowledge of the enemy - our enemies enjoyed it and greatly benefited from it.”
Israel’s political class has long speculated that Netanyahu would fire Gallant and replace him with a political ally to shore up his domestic power. Netanyahu has struggled to maintain a hold over his fragile, right-wing governing coalition and its muddle of competing interests, whose collapse could spell the end of his leadership.
When Netanyahu first sought to fire Gallant last year, over his opposition to proposed judicial reforms, it led to mass nationwide demonstrations. Minutes after Netanyahu made the announcement, opposition leaders called for Israelis to take to the streets in protest.
Demonstrations erupted in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Protestors outside Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem shouted “shame!” In Tel Aviv, protesters blocked a main highway while families of hostages held in Gaza chanted “Bibi is a traitor,” using the prime minister’s nickname.
Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is still in Gaza, said in a statement that firing Gallant “during a war and appointing a yes-man, who lacks security related experience, in his place, is sending a clear message – no one will stand up to Netanyahu and prevent him from torpedoing deals and prolonging the war.”
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called it an “act of madness.”
“Netanyahu is selling out Israel’s security and IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers for his despicable political survival,” Lapid posted on X Tuesday.
Clashes over the war and domestic politics
The relationship between both men was rarely cordial and often caustic. There was little love lost between them – over the state of negotiations with Hamas, Israel’s military strategy and Netanyahu’s bid to bring in a sweeping overhaul of the judiciary in 2023.
Netanyahu and Gallant have often disagreed over the war in Gaza. In August, Gallant told a closed-door Knesset committee that Netanyahu’s goal of “absolute victory” in Gaza was “nonsense,” according to Israeli media. Netanyahu then took the extraordinary step of releasing a press statement accusing Gallant of adopting an “anti-Israel narrative.”
Gallant was also highly critical of Netanyahu’s emphasis on controlling the Gaza-Egypt border, known as the Philadelphi Corridor. He said that prioritizing its control over a ceasefire and hostage deal was a “moral disgrace.” In the cabinet, he voted against continued occupation there. “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time,” he said.
But it may be domestic politics that ultimately played the biggest role.
Netanyahu on Tuesday was forced to withdraw draft legislation that would have allowed ultra-Orthodox Israelis to get government subsidies for daycare even if the father of the children does not serve in the IDF, as all other Jewish Israelis must do. Netanyahu relies on ultra-Orthodox parties to govern, and they have threatened to upend his coalition if they are forced to serve in the military en masse.
Gallant had been outspoken against the idea that ultra-Orthodox Israelis be exempt from service, saying that “the security system under my leadership will not submit it to legislation.”
Sa’ar, whom Netanyahu has tapped for foreign minister, is thought to be an influential interlocutor to the ultra-Orthodox parties. Netanyahu, in his statement, said that Sa’ar’s appointment “will enhance the stability of the coalition and the stability of the government, and these are very important at any time, but especially at wartime.”
Also on Tuesday, Israeli police announced that a criminal investigation had been opened “concerning events at the outset of the war,” without offering further details. Israeli media reported the investigation is related to suspicions that records of sensitive cabinet and security meetings were allegedly changed.
Gallant has repeatedly called for an official inquiry into the October 7 attack. It is the second investigation this week that threatens to ensnare Netanyahu. On Sunday, a court revealed that police had arrested a top Netanyahu aide for allegedly leaking classified and faked intelligence to foreign media.
Netanyahu had faced pressure from far-right members of his cabinet to dismiss him. On Tuesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir congratulated Netanyahu, accusing Gallant of being an impediment to “complete victory.”
Netanyahu’s relationship with Gallant deteriorated when the prime minister threatened to fire him in March 2023, after he criticized the government’s judicial overhaul legislation. The bill, which provoked widespread popular protests in Israel, would have granted the ruling coalition more sway in selecting judges.
Gallant was the first minister to oppose it, saying: “The deepening split is seeping into the military and security agencies - this is a clear, immediate and real danger to Israel’s security. I will not facilitate this.”
Netanyahu said he would fire the defense minister, but reversed his position following pressure. The rancor between the two men has persisted and grown since the Hamas attack last October.
Following news of the firing, US officials reiterated their partnership with Israel. “Minister Gallant has been a trusted partner as Israel’s Minister of Defense,” Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement.
“America’s commitment to Israel’s security remains ironclad and the U.S. Department of Defense will continue to work closely with Israel’s next Minister of Defense.”

Two Palestinians were killed in the town of Tamoun, said the governor of nearby Tubas, Ahmad Assad, alleging that one of the bodies was removed from the scene by the Israeli military with a bulldozer. CCTV footage from the neighborhood, seen by CNN, appeared to show a bulldozer moving a body.
In the village of Al-Shuhada, near the city of Jenin, an Israeli airstrike killed two people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, who were identified by local residents as a man and his nephew. Footage obtained by CNN of the aftermath of the strike shows bloodied footprints smeared along a dusty pathway.
Elsewhere, at least four people were killed in the city of Qabatya, according to the health ministry and emergency responders. Two were killed by Israeli gunfire, and two others killed when an Israeli military vehicle rammed a car and opened fire, according to residents and video seen by CNN.
Qatari-owned Al Araby TV alleged that Israeli fire in Qabatya also injured a Palestinian employee working there. Rabe’e Al-Munir, a photojournalist, is now hospitalized in stable condition, it said.
CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the incidents. Israel has previously described its stepped-up military offensives in the West Bank as targeting militants and “terrorist infrastructure.”
The bloodshed comes as violence surges in the West Bank, where the Israeli military has intensified incursions following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks.
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli troops and settlers have killed at least 775 Palestinians, including 167 children, in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, the Palestinian health ministry reported on Tuesday.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli settlers vandalized and set fire to vehicles in the city of Al-Bireh, in what Ramallah governor Laila Ghannam warned “could have ended in a massacre.”
Video taken by CNN in the aftermath of the fire showed burned vehicles, some reduced to ashes, next to an apartment block with burn marks on its walls. A community of residents, including young children, can be seen standing bewildered outside the block.
“I woke up to the sound, I started screaming,” said Ihab Al-Zahben, a father-of-four who lives in the area, to CNN.
The West Bank, a territory that lies between Israel and Jordan, is home to 3.3 million Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation, as well as hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis who began settling there some 57 years ago.
In total, nearly 1,600 settler attacks against Palestinians have been recorded since October 7, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on October 31.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/middleeast/israel-unwra-knesset-bill-analysis-intl/index.html,Israel has long wanted to dismantle the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency. The consequences could be disastrous for all,2024-11-03 07:00:47,"Benjamin Netanyahu sat down for his regular cabinet meeting and had some words for a new ally – and an old enemy.
“Last week I met with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley,” the Israeli prime minister told his colleagues. “I thanked her, on your behalf as well, for her decisive words in favor of the state of Israel – and against the anti-Israel obsession at the UN.”
“It is time UNRWA be dismantled,” he declared.
It was June 2017: the beginning of Donald Trump’s presidency. The possibilities for Netanyahu – who once bunked in the childhood bed of Trump’s son-in-law – seemed endless. In a few months, the American president would buck decades of foreign policy precedent and move his country’s embassy to the disputed city of Jerusalem.
In the case of UNRWA – the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees – Netanyahu would not get his wish so quickly. It would take another eight years.
The Israeli parliament, or Knesset, on October 28 voted through legislation to ban UNRWA from Israel and prohibit any contact between it and Israeli officials. Israel on Monday officially notified the UN that it was cancelling its 1967 agreement allowing the agency to work. The two laws do not mean the immediate end of the agency. Nor do they technically prevent it from working in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. But given the near-inextricable link between the agency’s ability to function there and the Israeli authorities, they almost certainly mean the end of UNRWA’s operation as we know it.
On Monday, a UN spokesperson warned “there is no alternative” to UNRWA, adding that Israeli authorities maintain responsibility to provide for the population in Gaza.
“If the law is fully implemented and the Israeli government makes it impossible for UNRWA to operate, this will have no effect on Israel’s responsibility to provide for the population,” said UN Secretary-General spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric.
There are as many opinions on why UNRWA, which provides services and aid to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East, was banned as there are people to ask.
Many point to allegations by the Israel Defense Forces that a handful of UNRWA’s 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the October 7 massacre, which saw 1,200 people killed and around 250 taken hostage. In a country still reeling from the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, this has been a potent and impossible to ignore argument against UNRWA.
Others see the move as another step in the erosion of Palestinian rights and the removal of their distant but long-promised right to return to the villages, now in Israel, from which they and their ancestors were violently evicted when the Jewish state was created in 1948.
In any case, the head of UNRWA has said that the legislation “will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell.”
‘Low-hanging fruit’
Boaz Bismuth, a Likud member of Knesset, wrote one of the two bills to ban UNRWA, which passed 92 to 10. In the wake of October 7, he believed that dismantling the agency was urgent.
“I did not see December ’49,” when UNRWA was created, he insisted. Nor, he said, was he motivated by the claim that UNRWA perpetuates Palestinian refugee status. “All this is totally irrelevant for me. What was relevant for me in my bill was the fact that they participated on the 7th of October massacre, and this is why they will not work in Israel anymore.”
The Israeli government in January said that 12 UNRWA staff members in Gaza had participated in the Hamas-led attack on Israel, and later added more to that list. The agency immediately fired most of the individuals concerned. A UN investigation found that nine employees “may have” been involved in the October 7 attack.
The Washington Post in February obtained CCTV footage from Kibbutz Be’eri on October, which it said showed one of the UNRWA employees accused by Israel of involvement, carrying the corpse of an Israeli man killed by Hamas militants.
UNRWA to this day maintains that Israel never provided it with evidence against its former employees. The agency says it had regularly provided Israel with a full list of its staff members, and has accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, coercing them into making false confessions about ties to Hamas.
But Bismuth said that “for me, UNRWA equals Hamas” – and his view is widespread in Israel. In a country where Netanyahu is politically ascendant against the odds, supporting his party’s legislation was plain old good politics.
“UNRWA was low-hanging fruit for this Israeli government,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime American policymaker in the Middle East who was a key player in the last serious round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, in 2000.
A long history
UNRWA is nearly as old as Israel itself. The violence surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948 displaced close to a million Arabs from their homes in what had been British-mandate Palestine – an event Palestinians call the Nakba, or “catastrophe.”
The UN General Assembly, which had consented to Israel’s creation, declared that all the displaced Arabs should be allowed to return “at the earliest practicable date.” A year later, it created UNRWA “to prevent conditions of starvation and distress.”
To Israelis, UNRWA is an anachronism that represents the unrealistic and distant dream of millions of Palestinians to return to their homes in what is now Israel. That is what Netanyahu means when he says the agency “perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem.” Philippe Lazzarini, the Swiss commissioner-general of UNRWA, has made clear that even if his agency were dissolved, it “will not strip the Palestinians from their refugee status.”
Israelis have long accused UNRWA of perpetuating anti-Israel ideology in schools they run. A UN-commissioned inquiry found that examples in textbooks of anti-Israel bias were “marginal” but nonetheless constituted “a grave violation of neutrality.”
Israeli leaders believe that Palestinians do not deserve their own refugee agency and should permanently resettle where they now live – assisted, if need be, by the agency responsible for all other refugees in the world, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR.
“What makes Palestinian refugees different is that they’re not seeking refuge in a third country,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian human rights lawyer. “They want to go home.”
‘What more do they want?’
Saleh Shunnar, displaced from his home in Gaza by the year-long war, knows what it means to be a refugee.
“Israel has always wanted to do this,” he said, speaking from a tent encampment in Deir Al-Balah, in central Gaza. “If they shut down UNRWA, that means there is no Palestinian refugee cause. They took away the Palestinian cause.”
Those fears run deep for many Palestinians. But concerns about the impact on so-called final status negotiations are “tethered to a galaxy far, far away, rather than to the realities back here on planet earth,” said Miller, the former American negotiator.
“I can understand why the Palestinians would regard this as a systematic first step to undermine the right of return,” he said. But the issues facing any negotiations over a Palestinian state are so numerous and so fraught that the right of return is far down the long list of obstacles, he said.
That is particularly the case when so many Palestinians face an imminent humanitarian catastrophe. On Monday, the head of UNRWA warned that the latest legislation will further jeopardize the trickle of aid entering Gaza.
Lazzarini said Israel approved an average of 30 daily aid trucks into Gaza last month – just six percent of what was going into the enclave before the war. However, the Israeli agency that controls the flow of aid into Gaza said 146 trucks entered via the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings on Sunday.
Other humanitarian agencies expressed alarm over the two new laws. On Tuesday, UK-based NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) told CNN that Israel had crossed “every imaginable red line.”
“From bombing and starvation, to systematically dismantling the health system, to now outlawing the UN agency on which millions of Palestinians depend for their most basic survival needs, Israel is attacking the very foundations of Palestinian survival in Gaza and, increasingly, across the region,” MAP said.
“These are the simplest of needs,” Deir Al-Balah resident Ghalia Abd Abu Amra said of the aid she receives. “What more do they want to take from us than what they already have? Our homes are gone, now they want to take UNRWA too?”
The massive tent camps for internally displaced Gazans have steadily become entrenched. Cloth walls become tarpaulin. Mud floors are replaced with wood. This transformation has been happening for decades across the 58 refugee camps run by UNRWA in the Palestinian territories and elsewhere in the region, as tent camps became residential blocks.
For millions of Palestinians, UNRWA functions as a parallel government. It is a vast organization that provides services that governments – whether in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Gaza, or the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem – are unable or unwilling to provide. It educates half a million students. It employs 3,000 medical professionals. It helps feed nearly two million people.
“UNRWA has saved Israeli taxpayers billions of dollars over the last 57 years,” said Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer who sits on the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. “Israel, as the occupying power under the fourth Geneva Convention, is responsible for the care, protection, and the provision of services to persons under occupation.”
“The international community has been doing that by its financial support for UNRWA,” he told journalists in New York. “So if UNRWA is kicked out, the cost for the Israeli taxpayer is going to be ginormous. So this is a decision that is bad for the Palestinians and ridiculous for Israeli taxpayers.”
Bismuth, the Knesset member who authored the UNRWA legislation, said that Israel would step in.
“You will not have a vacuum,” he said. “I feel good with my bill. Because all the services that they got – not only will they continue to get it, but we will even upgrade it.”
Indeed, UNRWA’s benefit to Israel had long been recognized by those in the government responsible for Palestinian affairs, said Nadav Tamir, a former diplomat who now serves as executive director of J Street Israel, a left-wing lobby group. He characterized their view as: “‘Of course UNRWA is problematic, but we don’t have another option, we need someone to take care of the issues.’” Before October 7, he explained, politicians could not overcome the “realpolitik” that UNRWA was an asset in taking a problem off Israel’s plate.
What that will look like remains a mystery to most. Miller is blunt: “Israelis don’t have a long-term solution.” In conversations with UNRWA staff members in the refugee camps around Jerusalem – who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak with the media – confusion reigned.
No one knows whether, when the legislation fully go into effect in three months, schools will remain open or medicine will be delivered. Tens of thousands of Palestinians who work for the agency could soon be unemployed.
“Most Israelis don’t really know the facts,” Tamir said. “They don’t really understand that there is no alternative. They think, ‘Oh, we can just bring another organization, or we could somehow do it on our own.’”
Even if the Israeli leadership decides that it can cast aside the moral issue of providing for Palestinian civilians, shutting down services for millions poses a threat for Israel itself.
“It’s a strategic issue that will promote more terrorism and of course all kind of epidemics that are not stopping at the border,” Tamir said. “So people who really know the situation I think are concerned. But most people and most politicians don’t really care about the reality. It’s all about the perception.”

Members of the elite Shayetet 13 force seized the alleged Hezbollah operative after landing on the coast in Batroun, a town in northern Lebanon, then took him back to Israeli territory, an Israeli military official told CNN.
The official added that the seized operative was now being investigated by Unit 504 – an intelligence unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Israel’s Shayetet 13, which operates out of the Atlit naval base on Israel’s northern Mediterranean coast, is sometimes likened to America’s Navy SEALS. The Israeli military has previously described Shayetet 13’s role to CNN as carrying out “strategic sabotage activity across enemy lines, including damaging vital structures during wartime and the enemy’s seaports.”
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported Saturday that eyewitnesses had seen “an unidentified military force carrying out a landing operation on ​​the Batroun beach” at dawn the day before.
The troops “moved with all their weapons and equipment to a chalet near the beach, where they kidnapped the citizen Imad Amhaz and took him to the beach, (then) left by speedboats to the open sea,” NNA reported.
The Lebanese government said its security services were investigating “an incident that took place in the Batroun area,” at dawn Friday.
Hezbollah released a statement referring to an incident of “Zionist aggression in the Batroun area” but did not provide further details. CNN has reached out to Hezbollah for comment.
The Israeli military official told CNN the country’s forces “will continue to act wherever necessary to protect the state of Israel and its citizens.”
The raid comes a little more than a month after Hezbollah said it had targeted a naval base on Israel’s northern Mediterranean coast that houses an elite Israeli naval commando unit – thought to be a reference to Shayetet 13.
Hezbollah claims that attack took place on September 23. Asked at the time for comment, the IDF said “no injuries were reported” – but it did not confirm that the naval base had been targeted.","['Tamar Michaelis', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/02/middleeast/iran-supreme-leader-response-israel-intl/index.html,Iran’s supreme leader vows ‘teeth-breaking response’ to Israel and US,2024-10-27 00:00:00,"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has promised a “teeth-breaking” response to Israel and the United States after Israel targeted Iranian military sites in retaliatory strikes late last month.
“The enemies, both the US and the Zionist regime (Israel), should know that they will definitely receive a teeth-breaking response for what they are doing against Iran and the resistance front,” said Khamenei, referring to Iran-allied militant groups including Hamas and Hezbollah.
He was speaking during a meeting with students on Saturday, ahead of the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the US embassy in Tehran, Iran’s state-run Press TV reported.
“We are certainly doing everything necessary to prepare the Iranian nation to stand against arrogance, whether in terms of military readiness, armaments, or political actions, and thank God, our officials are currently engaged in this,” he added.
Iran and Israel have long been enemies, a rivalry that deepened following Hamas’ attacks of October 7 last year and the subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza. Israel has been battling Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and overnight at least 19 people were injured in the central Israeli city of Tira after projectiles were launched over the border.
Khamenei’s remarks come a week after Israel’s latest round of strikes on Iran in response to the Islamic Republic’s October 1 missile attack on the Jewish state, which itself was a response to the Israeli killing of leaders from Hamas and Hezbollah.
For the first time, Israeli officials admitted hitting targets on Iranian soil in a significant escalation of tensions, although Israel stopped short of hitting Iranian energy or nuclear facilities.
Iran has been mulling its response to Israel’s strikes, with a high-ranking source telling CNN on Wednesday that they will be met with a “definitive and painful” retaliation that will likely come before the US presidential vote.
Khamenei’s remarks on Saturday signal a departure from Iran’s initial attempts to downplay the severity of the strikes carried out by Israel on October 25.
Following the strikes, Khamenei took a more measured tone, saying the attacks should “neither be exaggerated nor downplayed.”
An Israeli military source on Thursday said the country is at a “high level of readiness” for a response from Iran. But the source told CNN that they are “still assessing the decision-making process in Iran” to determine if and when a retaliation will take place.
White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday said Iran should not respond to Israel’s strikes on its territory, adding that “if Iran does choose to respond, however, the US will be standing by to assist Israel in its defense.”
Also this week, Iran said it could increase the range of its missiles, according to a report in state-run media. “If the Islamic Republic of Iran faces an existential threat, we will inevitably change the policy of our military doctrine,” the head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, Kamal Kharrazi, told Lebanon’s al-Mayadeen TV on Friday, per Press TV.
He also said Iran is capable of producing nuclear weapons but remains curbed by a mandate by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against weapons of mass destruction, Press TV reported.","['Vasco Cotovio', 'Sophie Tanno']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/02/middleeast/israel-airstrikes-lebanon-hospitals-intl-invs/index.html,"Lebanon: Israeli military dropped bombs in ‘lethal proximity’ of at least 19 hospitals, CNN analysis finds",2024-11-02 04:00:48,"The ground shook, windows shattered, and the cries of patients filled the air. An Israeli bomb had just struck Beirut’s southern suburbs in yet another near-nightly attack – this time hitting a building across the street from Lebanon’s biggest public hospital.
“I was treating a patient when the bomb went off. I fell over him from the shock of it,” said Mohammad Fouani, an emergency room nurse at Rafik Hariri University Hospital, recalling the aftermath of the October 21 attack. “The smoke was so thick; I could barely see my fellow colleagues.”
“Since the start of the war, every night has been difficult,” Fouani told CNN. “But this was the worst by far. It was the most painful.”
Israel said the strike hit a Hezbollah target, though the area was not covered in Israeli military evacuation orders for locations with alleged links to the Iran-backed group in the south of Beirut. At least 18 people, including four children, were killed and 60 injured in the residential building some 70 meters away from the hospital, Lebanon’s health ministry said.
Lebanon’s health sector has been in the thick of a ferocious Israeli air assault as Israel and Hezbollah trade fire in an ongoing war, with the country’s south and Beirut’s southern suburbs hardest hit. In the first month of its all-out air offensive in Lebanon, which began on September 23, Israeli strikes damaged 34 hospitals, killed 111 emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and hit 107 ambulances, according to data compiled by the Lebanese health ministry.
Around 20% of all hospitals registered with the health ministry in Lebanon have been damaged in a month of attacks, with most strikes landing in their vicinity, according to data compiled by medical authorities.
The Lebanese health ministry data and CNN’s analysis of airstrikes show that the Israeli military has dropped bombs within dangerous proximity of hospitals, which are protected under international law.
Responding to CNN’s request for comment, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operates in strict accordance with international law and accused Hezbollah of being deeply embedded in civilian areas. “Hezbollah strategically places its military assets in close proximity to medical facilities, such as hospitals and clinics, as part of its human shield strategy,” it said.
For a country that has been embroiled in many cycles of war and crises, the Lebanese healthcare sector has rarely been so vulnerable to firepower, the country’s health minister, Dr. Firass Abiad, told CNN. Abiad accused Israel of “weaponizing” access to healthcare and drew parallels to Gaza, where Israel has openly attacked hospitals, accusing them of links to Hamas.
“Health institutions are supposed to be sanctuaries,” said Abiad. “It’s clear that this is premeditated, that this is a state policy that Israel is following, whether in Gaza or in Lebanon.”
CNN has reviewed over 240 airstrikes in Lebanon and found that at least 24 hospitals were within a 500-meter danger zone – used by the Israeli military as its parameter for evacuation areas – of the bombs. Israel dropped munitions within what is known as a “lethal range” – 340 meters – of at least 19 hospitals, the analysis, which covered the first month of the war, showed.
CNN’s analysis only looked at airstrikes verified in publicly available imagery or declared in Israeli military evacuation orders between September 23 and October 23. That sample is smaller than the more than one thousand Israeli strikes estimated by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a crisis monitoring organization, to have hit Lebanon over the course of the month and so has likely produced a conservative estimate of hospitals within a dangerous or lethal range.
“Even a hospital that is not directly targeted can be damaged from the blast wave or fragmentation caused by a nearby strike,” Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US military, told CNN. “Fragments can injure or kill people hundreds of meters away, meaning a strike hundreds of meters away could still injure or kill people that are not behind adequate protection.”
CNN shared with the IDF a list of coordinates for all 24 hospitals it assessed as having been within dangerous proximity of Israeli strikes, 16 of which were damaged according to data compiled by the Lebanese health ministry and medics. The IDF did not comment on CNN’s specific findings, but said it was only operating against Hezbollah, “not the Lebanese population or medical facilities” and took measures to mitigate harm to civilians.
Abiad, who is a veteran doctor and former hospital director, said the nearby strikes have had a devastating affect on healthcare. “Once you target so close to the area, it means that people are now afraid to come to the hospital,” Abiad told CNN. “Some people in the hospital would rather go home than receive treatment because they are worried that they will be targeted in hospitals.”
The UN special coordinator for Lebanon said on October 25 that “first responders heeding the call to help, including healthcare personnel and paramedics, have also been hard hit,” and called the number of attacks impacting healthcare facilities and personnel “alarming.”
The attacks on the first responders, said Abiad, has sent “a very chilling message: if you’re injured, you’re going to die.”
Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of using ambulances to transport weapons, though it has not provided evidence. Many of the ambulances hit and first-responders killed in Israeli strikes were affiliated with Hezbollah’s civilian infrastructure. At least 12 Lebanese Civil Defense first responders and 16 Lebanese Red Cross paramedics have been killed in strikes. The IDF did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on attacks that have killed paramedics and emergency workers.
Since September 23, Israeli strikes have killed eight people inside the premises of four hospitals, and eight facilities have been forced to close, according to the health ministry.
Hospitals and other medical establishments are protected civilian objects under international humanitarian law. It is illegal, with few exceptions, to attack hospitals, ambulances or other health facilities, or to otherwise prevent them from providing care. In a report released on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch referred to Israeli attacks on healthcare workers in Lebanon as “apparent war crimes.”
The threat to Lebanon’s healthcare sector was felt most acutely on the night of October 21. As well as the strike that hit the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, Israel also claimed that another major hospital in the south of Beirut, Al Sahel General Hospital, was located above a Hezbollah bunker. Hours later, hospital staff and patients evacuated the facility for fear it would be hit. The next day, journalists toured the premises and said they found no evidence to support the claim.
Israel published a 3D graphic to show what they claimed was a Hezbollah underground facility storing cash and gold beneath the hospital. Officials at Sahel General Hospital vehemently denied the accusation, and Israel has not struck the hospital.
For the Lebanese, the graphic was reminiscent of imagery released by the Israeli military last year alleging the presence of a Hamas “command-and-control” center under Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital. The hospital was later attacked by Israeli forces.
“For me, what’s really concerning is that the rhetoric from the Israelis is the same, especially when they talk about infrastructure beneath healthcare,” said Dr. Thaer Ahmad, an American physician who volunteered at Gaza’s Al Nasser hospital in Khan Younis earlier this year and is now working in Lebanon.
Ahmad said all healthcare workers he’s interacted with are “pessimistic,” and fear the health system will suffer the same fate as it has in Gaza.
“There are no red lines. There is no respect for international humanitarian law. We saw that in Gaza for the past 13 months and we’re seeing it in Lebanon,” Ahmad told CNN. “Are we heading in that same direction, are we actually going to see this repeat itself?”
Fragmentation zones
Israel’s air, ground and naval assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon has decimated the Iran-backed group’s military leadership and dealt harsh blows to its rank-and-file, as well as to its arsenal of weaponry. It has also killed hundreds of civilians, according to health authorities, and destroyed large swathes of civilian infrastructure.
Israel has regularly dropped 1,000-pound and 2,000-pound bombs on Lebanon, according to analysis of aftermath imagery by weapons experts, inflicting catastrophic damage to neighborhoods and towns. The Israeli military has argued that it has deployed these bombs as bunker busters to destroy Hezbollah’s underground infrastructure.
The weapons experts told CNN that Israel has also used the GBU-39, or small-diameter bomb, to take out single floors of multistorey buildings. The attacks have been concentrated in, though not restricted to, areas of Hezbollah dominance – namely the south and east of the country as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut.
The lethal fragmentation radius of these bombs puts nearby people and civilian structures, such as hospitals, at serious risk. When they are dropped, white-hot metal fragments can fly out in all directions, tearing through their surroundings. Known by experts as a “kill zone,” the area of exposure to injury or death around a target can range from 340 meters for small-diameter bombs, to 365 meters for 1,000 and 2,000 bombs, weapons experts say.
All eight hospitals in the southern suburbs of Beirut, known as Dahiyeh, fell within the lethal fragmentation zones of verified airstrikes. According to the health ministry, all of these healthcare facilities were damaged in the first month of Israel’s offensive since late September. Three hospitals on the edges of the area were also damaged, according to the ministry’s data.
Almost all of Hezbollah’s leadership were killed in Israeli strikes in Dahiyeh, the group’s seat of power. Several videos of attacks there have shown signs of secondary explosions – evidence that at least some of the targets were weapons depots.
Beirut’s southern suburbs, previously home to around a million people, were also a major flashpoint of Israeli attacks in the country’s last all-out war with Lebanon in 2006. Airstrikes there transformed large parts of the area into a seemingly endless stretch of rubble and detritus. Yet back then, the bombing campaign left hospitals in the south of Beirut comparatively unscathed.
Under international law, a hospital can lose its special protected status only if it is being used for military purposes. But the wounded and sick inside are still protected by the principle of proportionality, and time must be given for evacuation before an attack.
On October 1, an Israeli strike near al-Zahra University Hospital in Dahiyeh killed one person and injured two more inside the facility’s premises, according to the health ministry. Video of the attack analyzed by CNN found that the strike hit a building adjacent to the perimeter of the hospital, less than 50 meters away from the main building.
The analysis found that the weapon was likely a GBU-39.
The hardest-hit health facilities have been in the southernmost part of Lebanon, where the Israeli air assault has been the most intense and ground forces have been met with fierce resistance from Hezbollah fighters. It was in that region that the first of the country’s hospitals shuttered after the start of the all-out offensive.
In the town of Bint Jbeil, Israel struck a mosque which it described as a command center within the compound of the Salah Ghandour hospital on October 4. Ten people inside the hospital were injured, according to the health ministry, forcing it to close.
That day, an Israeli airstrike hit the premises of Marjayoun governmental hospital in a southern Christian town of the same name.
Two people were killed outside of the hospital’s emergency room, according to health minister Abiad. CNN spoke to the director of the hospital hours after it was evacuated.
“We held on for as long as we could,” Dr. Mones Kalakish told CNN as he was departing the Marjayoun area, which had been surrounded by intensive bombardment for weeks. “But this morning, we came under fire, and we had to evacuate. We were panicked and we were terrified.”
The night that a nearby strike rocked Beirut’s Rafik Hariri University Hospital there was panicked discussion among the staff about whether to evacuate. “Because of Gaza and what happened to the hospitals in the south and the rest of the country, our initial thought was that the hospital itself was hit,” said Rafik Hariri University Hospital director Jihad Saadeh. “But when we saw that it wasn’t a direct hit, we were reassured. We continued our work.”
For Nurse Foany, merely considering the evacuation was a terrifying thought. “Can you imagine what that was like? Imagine evacuating Lebanon’s largest public hospital, not just its staff but its sick and its injured in a single night,” he said. “It was a horrific thought.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/middleeast/israel-iron-beam-laser-system-intl/index.html,Israel plans to use lasers to shoot down incoming missiles,2024-11-01 11:59:39,"Israel expects its “Iron Beam” laser defense system to be operational within one year, saying it will bring “a new era of warfare” as it engages in a war of drones and missiles with Iran and its regional partners.
The Jewish state spent more than $500 million on deals this week with Israeli developers Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, architect of Israel’s Iron Dome, and Elbit Systems to expand production of the shield. Dubbed the Iron Beam, the shield aims to use high-power lasers to counter an array of projectiles, including missiles, drones, rockets and mortars, Israel’s defense ministry said this week.
“It heralds the beginning of a new era in warfare,” Eyal Zamir, director general of the defense ministry, said in a statement this week. “The initial capability of the ground-based laser system… is expected to enter operational service within one year,” he said.
Israel first unveiled a prototype of the Iron Beam in 2021 and has since been working to get it up and running.
The defense ministry’s comments come as Israel presses on with wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and after its military engaged twice in direct missile attacks with Iran.
Since Israel began its war on Hamas in Gaza last year, following the October 7 attack, it has also been fighting a war with the Iran-backed “Axis of Resistance” across Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq. Iran and its partners have been seeking to overwhelm Israel’s Iron Dome by pelting it with various projectiles, from rockets and drones to mortars and ballistic missiles, experts previously said.
From southern Lebanon, where Israel is now waging a ground war, Hezbollah’s rockets have reached deep inside Israel. Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s beachside home in the coastal city of Caesarea was damaged in a drone strike claimed by the Shiite Lebanese group. One of the three drones that were launched evaded Israel’s aerial defense system.
Experts say the Iron Beam could be an added layer of defense for Israel, both in terms of effectiveness and cost.
How does it work?
The system uses a high-power laser that is stationed on the ground. With a range of hundreds of meters to several kilometers, the laser heats up the target’s shell in vulnerable areas, including its engine or warhead, until the projectile collapses.
This is different to Israel’s traditional means of destroying missiles and rockets, where radar is used to identify an incoming threat and then an interceptor missile is fired to destroy the projectile midair.
Compared to the Iron Dome, a laser shield would be cheaper, faster and more effective, experts said.
Each Iron Dome interception missile is estimated to cost approximately $50,000, if not more, according to experts. Israel fires two missiles per interception, Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, told CNN.
Israel has been intercepting projectiles almost daily since the war with its northern neighbor began. Just on Tuesday, some 50 projectiles crossed from southern Lebanon into Israeli territory, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that some were intercepted and others weren’t.
Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which is helping produce the Iron Beam, said that a laser defense system has “almost zero cost per interception.” In 2022, former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said each laser-based interception was expected to cost just $2.
“Economics is obviously the big point,” Sascha Bruchmann, a visiting research fellow for defense and military analysis at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said, told CNN. “You won’t ruin the defense budget.”
The laser system would be most effective against drones, experts said, which Israel’s Iron Dome has repeatedly failed to intercept.
While Israel’s Iron Dome does intercept and destroy most projectiles, it is primarily designed to counter rockets and missiles, not drones. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are small, light and have a low radar signature, which means Israel’s radar systems will not always detect them the way they detect missiles, which are bigger, experts said. Drones also don’t always have a set destination and may change direction mid-travel.
The laser system will be very effective against drones, Kalisky said. The laser will be able to effectively “heat and destroy” drones and UAVs.
Who else has it?
Other governments have experimented with different types of laser systems. The US Navy has tested high-energy laser weapons that can destroy aircraft mid-flight and the United Kingdom has recently showcased a laser-energy weapon called DragonFire that can be used against aerial threats. The Pentagon has also said that China and Russia are developing lasers that could target satellites.
It is unclear if Iran has developed a laser defense system of its own. In 2022, Iran said it was “capable of manufacturing laser weapons to defend… sensitive regions,” state media said.
Iran is, however, suspected to have the Chinese-made “Silent Hunter” laser weapon, experts said, adding that the laser is not as high-powered as the ones designed for the Iron Beam.
Will it really be a gamechanger?
An Israeli Iron Beam would still have its drawbacks.
The laser system would not operate well in cloudy, rainy or hazy weather, experts said, adding that this decreases the laser’s ability to pass through the atmosphere and reach its target. The system would also require great amounts of power to keep it running.
The project’s aspirations and expected timeframe also remain unclear.
One of the main problems was that to meet their aspirations with this laser technology, governments always needed billions of dollars and decades of research, Bruchmann said. The world is yet to see if Israel “actually cracked the code this time,” and can operate it by next year, he said.
Kalisky of the INSS said that, while it is unclear if the Iron Beam will indeed be a “gamechanger” for Israel, it will still be “another layer of defense,” adding that it will likely be most effective against drones and short-range rockets and missiles. It may not be as effective against ballistic missiles, he said, which Israel’s Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 interceptors have traditionally thwarted.
Experts say the Iron Beam could also act as a deterrent to further attacks by Iran or its proxies. Last month, The New York Times reported that Hamas was keen to carry out its October 7 attack by the end of 2023, fearing Israel would start deploying its laser system, which would have been more effective against Hamas rockets. The newspaper was citing documents seized by the Israeli military and obtained by the Times.
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
“Iran and its proxies (may) calculate that this would be, from their point of view, a gamechanger,” Bruchmann said, “that it would seriously devalue the tens or hundreds of thousands of missiles they are building up as a strategic arsenal to deter Israel.”",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

Hopes for progress in ending the fighting in Lebanon are slightly higher, and the country’s prime minister on Thursday voiced optimism that a deal to bring an end to cross-border violence between Israel and Hezbollah could be in the final stages.
“We are doing our best and are optimistic that within the next few hours or days we will have a ceasefire,” Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Wednesday in an interview with Lebanese media outlet Al Jadeed.
Any progress at lowering temperatures in the region will be considered a win inside the White House. Still, the sense that Netanyahu is waiting out the US campaign season – a long-held view inside the Biden administration – remains strong as top envoys travel in the region to discuss prospects of bringing the violence to an end.
CIA Director Bill Burns was in Cairo on Thursday for discussions on Gaza and Lebanon, including a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.
At the same time, US envoy Amos Hochstein and White House Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk are in Israel for talks on hostage and ceasefire issues along with a discussion of Iran, all centered on the US policy of “de-escalation backed by deterrence.”
Hopes for striking a deal to end the fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border have been freshly bolstered by progress in the talks over the past several days, and Hochstein was expected to continue the talks this week.
On Thursday, Netanyahu told Hochstein and McGurk that Israel must have the ability to enforce a potential ceasefire agreement in Lebanon to thwart threats from the country.
“Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper, but Israel’s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes,” the statement said.
The US envoys also met Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant to discuss “security arrangements” related to northern Israel, Lebanon and the return of hostages from Gaza.
But with the conclusion of a razor-thin US election in sight, there is little expectation the final drive toward concluding the war in Gaza will result in immediate success.
That makes it likely the war in Gaza will continue shadowing the US contest in its final days. On Wednesday evening, a few minutes into Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech in Madison, a few disruptions broke out inside the arena, which was filled with many students from the nearby University of Wisconsin-Madison.
“Ceasefire now!” one protester shouted.
“We all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out,” Harris said, adding that she would do “everything in my power” to bring the Middle East conflict to a close.
As a few more protesters echoed in the crowd, she added sharply: “Everyone has the right to be heard, but right now I am speaking.”
The scene, which has been repeated at Harris rallies throughout her abbreviated campaign, demonstrates the political liability the Middle East has become for the Democratic candidate.
Harris almost always points back to the necessity of a ceasefire, even as the talks to secure one stalled.
This week, American officials heading to the Middle East hope to make one final push toward resolving the conflicts before the election, but they are realistic about the likelihood of major breakthroughs.
In Cairo, Burns was expected to continue discussing a new proposal raised in recent days by the United States, Israel and Qatar involving a monthlong ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of some hostages.
After months of stop-and-go negotiations, American officials remain cautiously hopeful the new proposal can shake loose the stalled talks, particularly after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.
But a number of details are still outstanding, according to people familiar with the talks, including the number and breakdown of hostages and Palestinian prisoners who would be released as part of the agreement.
The temporary truce would be shorter than the six-week first phase that was previously being discussed before talks last fell apart, two sources familiar with the talks said. Qatari negotiators, who, along with Egypt, are the main interlocutors with Hamas, are currently discussing the limited proposal with Hamas, one of the sources said.
And there is continued pessimism that Hamas will agree to any new plan that doesn’t include a permanent ceasefire. Hamas wants “confirmation that there is Israeli approval on any plan that is presented to them,” a diplomat familiar with the discussions said.
On Sunday, Burns was in Doha to meet with Israel’s Mossad Director David Barnea and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani in an attempt to revive the ceasefire discussions following Sinwar’s death, which US officials have argued should be a turning point in the Gaza war.
In Lebanon, where Israel has been waging a major operation against Hezbollah, American officials hope to arrange a diplomatic solution to end the violence.
After a conversation Thursday with Hochstein ahead of his visit to the region, Lebanon’s Mikati said he felt optimistic for a potential Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire to be struck “within the next few hours or days.”
Israel and the White House had earlier downplayed a reported ceasefire draft proposal to address the Israel-Hezbollah conflict that had been circulating in regional media outlets.
“There are many reports and drafts circulating. None reflect the current state of negotiations,” the Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement to CNN.
The White House offered the same message; National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said purported drafts shared online do not reflect the current state of ceasefire talks.

Will Netanyahu listen?,2024-09-30 00:00:00,"In subtle but increasingly vocal ways, Israel’s military leaders are signaling that the country has achieved all it can militarily in Lebanon and Gaza, and it’s time for the politicians to strike a deal.
It comes as Lebanon’s prime minister says that a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel could be imminent. Both candidates for the American presidency have also made clear they do not want wars in Gaza and Lebanon to be on the agenda when they take office.
When the Israel Defense Forces’ top general sat down with officers in northern Gaza – who are waging one of the military’s fiercest operations since last year’s invasion – he went further than ever in suggesting the military phases of both conflicts should end.
“In the north, there’s a possibility of reaching a sharp conclusion,” Herzi Halevi, Chief of the General Staff, said, referring to the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. In Gaza, he said, “if we take out the northern Gaza Brigade commander, it’s another collapse…. I don’t know what we’ll encounter tomorrow, but this pressure brings us closer to more achievements.”
What those achievements should be is the subject of much consternation.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly pledged “absolute victory.” His defense minister and longtime political tormentor Yoav Gallant has bristled at that goal. In August, he told a closed-door parliamentary committee meeting that the idea of “absolute victory” in Gaza was “nonsense,” according to Israeli media.
Gallant’s dim view of Netanyahu’s war goal was made official when earlier this week he reportedly sent a private memo to the prime minister and the rest of his cabinet saying that the war had lost its way.
“The current situation in which we operate, without a valid compass and without updated war objectives, undermines the management of the campaign and cabinet decisions,” Gallant wrote, according to Israel’s Channel 13, a CNN affiliate.
In Gaza, he wrote, Israel should ensure the release of the remaining hostages, make sure there is no military threat from Hamas, and promote civilian rule. That’s a far cry from the existing, maximalist war aim of eliminating Hamas’ military and governance capabilities.
CNN asked the Israeli defense ministry for comment on the memo. A spokesperson for the prime minister declined to comment.
Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Wednesday he was optimistic for a potential Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire to be struck “within the next few hours or days,” after speaking with US envoy Amos Hochstein, who arrived in the region on Thursday.
Israel has for the past month carried out a massive, country-wide bombing campaign in Lebanon, and killed Hezbollah’s elusive leader, Hassan Nasrallah. In his interview, Mikati indicated that Hezbollah is no longer insisting that its conflict with Israel will only cease once the war in Gaza ends. That would allow it to accept a ceasefire without an end to the Gaza campaign.
“There is at the moment a desire to quit the war in Lebanon while we’re ahead,” a person familiar with the Israeli government’s thinking told CNN.
Gallant has said Hamas and Hezbollah have now been rendered totally ineffective as Iranian proxies.
“These two organizations, Hamas and Hezbollah, that were groomed for years as a long arm against the State of Israel, are no longer an effective tool in the hands of Iran,” Gallant said during a memorial service on Sunday. “We know that some goals cannot be achieved by military action alone, and thus, we must honor our moral obligations to bring our captives home, despite the painful compromises involved.”
And yet Netanyahu has remained defiant. When the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, returned from recess this week, the prime minister seemed to repeat his maximalist goal, and indicated he was unlikely to accept a conclusion anytime soon: “The absolute victory is an orderly and consistent work plan that we fulfill step by step,” he said.
Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas are engaged in indirect negotiations in Qatar for the first time in two months. Netanyahu’s office said on Monday that if a limited proposal – a short ceasefire in exchange for hostage releases – were offered, “the Prime Minister would accept it on the spot.” However, a source familiar with the talks told CNN that Netanyahu continues to refuse to give any concrete assurances of a pathway to a bigger deal to end the war.
“The most important war goal has not been achieved, which is bringing the hostages home,” another official familiar with the talks told CNN. “Gaza will not end until the hostages are home.”",['Mick Krever'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/28/middleeast/unrwa-israel-knesset-vote-ban-palestinians-intl/index.html,What is UNRWA and why did Israel’s Knesset ban the agency when the move can be devasting for millions?,2024-10-28 20:04:13,"Israel’s parliament has voted to ban a United Nations agency that has provided essential services for Palestinian refugees for nearly eight decades, a move that could have devastating consequences for millions of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.
On Monday, the Knesset passed two bills; one barring the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from activity within Israel, and another banning Israeli authorities from any contact with UNRWA – revoking the 1967 treaty that allows the agency to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control.
The move is expected to severely restrict the UNRWA from operating in territories Israel occupies, including Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
According to the published law, all contact between Israeli officials and the UN agency will end in three months from Monday. The 1967 treaty will expire within seven days of the bill’s passing, as Israel’s foreign minister makes the UN aware of its intention to terminate the treaty, the law says.
Following the passing of the first law, Boaz Bismuth, a member of the Likud party, the architect of the bill, said: “Anyone that behaves like a terrorist has no rights in Israel…. UNRWA equals Hamas, period.”
The move went ahead despite heated opposition from Arab members of the Knesset and strong international pressure from Western nations. The first law was approved with 92 votes in favor, 10 against. The second was approved with 87 votes in favor, 9 against.
The vote was swiftly criticized by UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini, who said it violated international law and was “the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role toward providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine refugees.”
Several countries, including the United States, have expressed deep concerns about the ban. Prior to the vote, the US State Department had urged Israel not to pass the legislation, saying the agency plays “an irreplaceable role right now in Gaza.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously warned Israel that passing the legislation could “have implications under US law and US policy.”
Despite those widely expressed concerns, during the passing of the laws, Knesset member Yuli Edelstein said the move would “not in any way harm humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip” and insisted Israel was acting within the framework of international law.
Israel has long sought to dismantle the UN body, arguing that some of its employees are affiliated with Hamas, and that its schools teach hate against Israel. UNRWA has repeatedly denied these accusations, saying there is “absolutely no ground for a blanket description of ‘the institution as a whole’ being ‘totally infiltrated.’”
Here’s what we know about UNRWA, and the implications of the Israeli ban.
What is UNRWA and what does it do?
UNRWA was founded by the United Nations a year after the 1948 creation of Israel that led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in an event known by Palestinians as the “Nakba” (catastrophe).
The agency, which began by assisting about 750,000 Palestinian refugees in 1950, now serves some 5.9 million across the Middle East, many of whom live in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem as well as in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria.
In the Gaza Strip, which has been ravaged by a devastating Israeli war for more than a year, UNRWA serves some 1.7 million Palestinian refugees. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it assists around 871,500 refugees.
The agency provides a wide range of aid and services to Palestinian refugees and their descendants, including shelter, healthcare, food and education. It is also a major source of employment for the refugees, who make up most of its more than 30,000 employees across the Middle East, and has representative offices in New York, Geneva and Brussels.
More than 13,000 of its employees are stationed in Gaza alone. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it employs nearly 4,000 workers.
UNRWA is unique in that it is the only UN agency dedicated to a specific group of refugees in specific areas. While its purpose is to support Palestinian refugees, UNRWA does not have a mandate to resettle them
The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is the body that is tasked with resettlement of refugees, but its mandate does not extend to areas UNRWA operates in.
Why does Israel want to ban UNRWA?
Israel has long opposed the agency and sought to dismantle it even before October 7 last year, when Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 hostages. Israeli officials have rejected UNRWA’s definition of which Palestinians are eligible for refugee status, arguing that descendants of the 1948 refugees do not qualify and thus don’t have the right to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel.
An Israeli member of parliament behind the bills accused UNRWA on Sunday of “educating kids to hate Israel and spreading antisemitism.”
“UNRWA… is selling them (Palestinians) stories that they will be able to come back to Israel. This will not happen,” Yulia Malinovsky, a lawmaker for the Israel Beitenu party told CNN Sunday.
But since the war started, Israel has launched an intense campaign to delegitimize the UN body, including accusing some of UNRWA’s employees of association with Hamas’ attack, alleging they took part in varying capacities.
UNRWA strongly denied the allegations, but several governments, including the US, suspended funding for the agency earlier this year while the allegations were being investigated. In January, the agency terminated the contracts of those Israel named and launched an investigation into its claims. Most nations have since restored funding with the exception of the US, its biggest donor.
UNRWA said that that as of October 20 of this year, 233 of its workers were killed. And last month, the agency said that an UNRWA staffer “was shot and killed on the roof of his home by a sniper during an overnight Israeli military operation” in El Far’a Camp in the occupied West Bank, marking the first time a member of the UN agency was killed in the West Bank in more than 10 years, UNRWA said.
What would the impact of UNRWA’s banning be?
UN Secretary-General António Guterres said earlier this month that “in midst of all the upheaval, UNRWA – more than ever – is indispensable… is irreplaceable.”
The UN chief said he sent a letter to Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, telling him that the proposed bill would “suffocate efforts to ease human suffering and tensions in Gaza, and indeed, the entire Occupied Palestinian Territory.”
“It would be a catastrophe,” Guterres said, “in what is already an unmitigated disaster.”
But his calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears. The UN chief has been declared persona-non-grata, or an unwanted person, by Israel, whose officials have repeatedly accused Guterres of being sympathetic to Israel’s adversaries.
UNRWA is the primary humanitarian aid group in Gaza. Nearly 2 million Gazans rely on the agency for aid, with 1 million people using UNRWA shelters for food and healthcare in the enclave. The agency has provided Gazans with everything from food and healthcare to education and psychological support for decades.
Along with the Palestinian Red Crescent, UNRWA handles almost all distribution of UN aid coming into the territory. The agency has 11 food distribution centers for 1 million people in Gaza, more than half of whom UNRWA assesses to live below the abject poverty line of US$ 1.74 per person per day.
The agency has also helped implement an emergency polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, alongside other UN bodies, in a bid to stop the infectious virus that can cause paralysis from spreading. Last week, the third phase of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza was postponed due to escalating violence in north Gaza, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.
In the West Bank, UNRWA provides services for 19 refugee camps, more than 90 schools and a number of health services, including prenatal care. It distributes basic food supplies, loans, as well as emergency cash grants and shelter, according to the agency’s website.
It is unclear who would assume assistance for the millions of Palestinian refugees who rely on UNRWA, if it wasn’t able to. Israel has previously tried to dismantle the agency and called for the merging of its responsibilities with the UNHCR.
The US State Department told CNN that the ban would make it impossible for UNRWA to operate and would leave a “vacuum that Israel would then be responsible for filling.”
Aida Touma-Suleiman, an Israeli-Arab politician and member of the Arab-majority Hadash party, said the “bills stem from a long time ambition of the Israeli right – to strip Palestinian refugees from their status.”
“Israel is in effect creating new refugees every day while questioning the legitimacy of that very status,” Touma-Suleiman said on X.
What is the international community saying?
On Monday, foreign ministers of seven countries – Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom – called on Israel to halt the legislation, expressing “grave concern” over its implications.
“UNRWA provides essential and life-saving humanitarian aid and basic services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and throughout the region,” the foreign ministers said in a joint statement.
Despite its suspension of funding to UNRWA, the US has also opposed the ban. In a letter sent to two senior members of the Israeli government earlier this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Biden administration was “deeply concerned” about it.
Ireland, Norway, Slovenia and Spain also condemned the ban, saying it “sets a very serious precedent for the work of the United Nations and for all the organizations of the multilateral system,” according to a joint statement from the four nations shared online by Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin.
Germany’s human rights commissioner Luise Amstberg warned that these laws if “implemented by the Israeli government in this form” would “effectively make UNRWA’s work in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem impossible.” This would be “a fatal step,” Amstberg said.
The United Kingdom said Israel had an obligation under international law to ensure that “sufficient aid reaches civilians in Gaza,” with British Foreign Minister David Lammy saying UNRWA was the only agency that “can deliver humanitarian aid at the scale and pace needed.”
UNRWA chief Lazzarini has appealed to UN member states to step in, warning that the ban would have dire repercussions for the entire Middle East. Israel’s move means UNRWA’s mission to provide health care, education, and food to millions of Palestinian refugees “may become impossible without decisive intervention by the General Assembly,” Lazzarini said in a letter Tuesday to the UN General Assembly president.
The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), joined a growing list of humanitarian organizations that have condemned the ban. “This decision is the culmination of a long-running campaign against the organization, with consequences that will impact generations to come,” said MSF Secretary General Christopher Lockyear.","['Nadeen Ebrahim', 'Salma Arafa']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/middleeast/israels-strikes-on-iran-shattered-a-forty-year-taboo-mime-intl/index.html,Israel’s strikes on Iran broke a 40-year taboo. Tehran faces tough choices about what to do next,2024-10-29 15:15:09,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a weekly look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
Iran rushed to downplay the impact of Israel’s strikes on its territory this weekend, suggesting that it has taken an off-ramp to avoid a wider war, but the attack set a precedent the Islamic Republic has tried to avoid since its inception 40 years ago.
The adversaries had spent decades avoiding direct confrontation, instead choosing to exchange punches in a shadow war. Israel used clandestine operations to assassinate key Iranian figures and execute cyberattacks on vital facilities as Iran continued activating its Arab proxy militias to attack the Jewish state.
Saturday’s attack marked the first time Israel has acknowledged striking Iran, bringing the shadow war into the open and crossing a threshold that has led some in the Islamic Republic to question the country’s deterrence capabilities.
In April, after Iran attacked Israel in retaliation for what it said was an Israeli attack on its diplomatic building in the Syrian capital Damascus, US officials said Israel responded by attacking Iran just days later. Israel didn’t publicly acknowledge that attack.
The latest attack, however, was different. Israel openly said it conducted “precise strikes” on military targets in Iran.
“Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran,” Israel’s military spokesman Daniel Hagari said, touting achievements in the attack.
Shortly after the assault, Iran’s state media published images showing everyday life continuing as usual in its cities. Schools continued operating and Tehran’s streets were shown gridlocked with traffic. Hardline commentators mocked the attack on television and social media memes poked fun at the limited nature of the Israeli response.
Internal debate emerging
In his first comments after the attack, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei opted to give a measured response, saying the strikes should “neither be exaggerated nor downplayed.”
But that initial wave of dismissal eventually dissipated, and an internal debate emerged over whether Iran should deliver a harsh response to prevent Israeli strikes from becoming normalized against a regime focused on its own survival.
“The sense is that if they do not respond they will normalize the idea that Israel can strike Tehran without getting a response,” Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC said, adding that there is a “fear if they don’t do something now Israel will start treating Iran as they did with Syria which means every once in a while, (Israelis will) strike.”
The strikes, which were a response to an Iranian attack on Israel three weeks ago, steered clear of nuclear and oil facilities – instead striking what was described by the Israeli military as “strategic systems in Iran” that carry “great importance.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s defense systems and its ability to export missiles were severely damaged. CNN is unable to independently verify the claims.
Iranian officials say some military sites sustained “minor damage” that was “swiftly repaired.” Five people were killed, including four army personnel, the Iranian government said.
Experts however say that the damage was more significant than Tehran has acknowledged.
“This (attack) was much more damaging than Iranian officials have let on, Iran’s air defenses and some of the radars that are crucial to identifying incoming missiles, it seems that those were destroyed in the first wave,” Nicole Grajewski, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Tehran spent years building regional proxies designed to serve as a security umbrella and the first line of defense against Israel. These militias, stationed at Israel’s borders, also acted as a deterrent, discouraging Israel from directly striking Iran. The idea was that if Israel were to strike Iran, Tehran would retaliate by unleashing its militias against Israel.
The longstanding balance of power prevented a regional war – until Iran-backed Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza last year, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. That prompted a fierce Israeli onslaught that has destroyed the enclave and killed more than 42,000 Palestinians. The expansion of that conflict to southern Lebanon led to Israel’s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s most formidable proxy, and decimated the organization’s commanding hierarchy.
The degrading of Iran’s strongest allied militias, Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as the weekend strikes on Iran, have fueled another internal debate in Iran: whether regional proxies are an effective deterrence.
“There are certainly voices within the political establishment who question the efficacy of the ‘forward defense’ doctrine, or the notion that Iran’s regional alliance network can provide a security umbrella. If that is changing, one natural aspect of the debate is what could take place to restore deterrence,” Mohammad Ali Shabani, the editor of Amwaj.media, a London-based news site focusing on Iran, Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula.
The nuclear option
Since the Trump administration abandoned the nuclear agreement with Tehran in 2018, to put curbs on its nuclear program, the Islamic Republic has been gradually ramping up enrichment of uranium, a key ingredient of a nuclear bomb if purified to a high level. Its stockpiles have reached 60% purity, a short step away from weapons-grade, which is 90%.
Iranian officials have repeatedly stated that they have no intention of weaponizing the country’s nuclear program, while simultaneously using its potential as leverage in negotiations with the West.
As Israel continues disintegrating Iran’s deterrence capability, the minority voices in the Islamic Republic favoring the weaponization of its nuclear program are becoming stronger, Parsi said. “The trajectory and momentum are with those who are saying if Iran actually had a nuclear deterrence this would not be happening.”
Experts cast doubt over Iran’s ability to quickly build a nuclear weapon even if it can purify uranium to weapons grade. The process to build and test an atomic bomb may take years, leaving Iran vulnerable to Israeli attacks on its nuclear facilities.
The nuclear bomb option is “much more public now” and has become “normalized in conversation,” but Israel has been able to derail Iran’s nuclear program in the past and may be able to do it again, Grajewski said.
Parsi said if the Israelis were to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, regardless of whether the Iranians can get a bomb quickly or not, Tehran will seek to build a nuclear weapon.
“Even the more hawkish American presidents have not favored taking military strikes because the most likely outcome is that, at some point, that will make Iran turn nuclear,” Parsi said.",['Mostafa Salem'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/middleeast/naim-qassem-new-hezbollah-leader-israel-war-intl/index.html,Hezbollah names a new leader to replace Nasrallah. Here’s what we know about him,2024-06-19 00:00:00,"Hezbollah has named Shiite cleric Naim Qassem as leader, over a month after his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike.
The group’s Senior Council elected Qassem as secretary-general, Hezbollah’s media office said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that Qassem is committed to prophet “Mohammed’s authentic Islam” and the core principles of the group.
Qassem now leads a group once regarded as Iran’s most formidable proxy in its conflict with Israel – a force that, in recent weeks, has been significantly weakened by Israeli strikes, with top leaders killed, thousands of fighters wounded, and missile capabilities degraded. The group now faces an intense Israeli military campaign in southern Lebanon.
Responding to the announcement, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant wrote on X: “Temporary appointment. Not for long.”
The cleric had long been the group’s second-in-command, serving as deputy chief to the late Nasrallah. He is one of the few leaders of the Iran-backed group to survive Israel’s recent onslaught on the organization, which saw some of its key figures assassinated.
“The organization was left with little choices in terms of the top tier clerics,” Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy director for research at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, told CNN, adding that Qassem was “a known face” and therefore his appointment was “a no-brainer choice for the organization.”
Hashem Safieddine, thought to have been a much stronger contender to succeeded Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli attack in Beirut, along with other commanders.
Born in 1953 in the southern Lebanese village of Kfar Kila, Qassem is a well-known member of the old guard. The 71-year-old Shiite cleric helped found Hezbollah in 1982, and has served seven consecutive terms as deputy secretary-general since 1991. He also oversees the group’s parliamentary activities.
Before his work with Hezbollah, he took part in “Harakat al Mahrumin,” or the Movement of the Dispossessed – a political group that later morphed into the Shiite Amal movement, a Hezbollah-allied group that is now led by speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri.
The cleric has long been under Israel’s radar. Before killing Nasrallah, Israel also targeted his predecessor Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed in an airstrike in 1992.
Qassem was a chemistry teacher for six years before his days in Hezbollah. He often gave interviews on television and to newspapers. In 2015, he wrote the book, Hezbollah: The Story from Within, which told the story of the Hezbollah’s emergence as “resistance force” and political party that sought to counter Israeli occupation.
Despite his media prominence, he was not someone average Lebanese citizens could relate to, Ali said, making him unlikely to match his predecessor’s popularity. Qassem represented “the lower middle class,” while Nasrallah “belonged to the impoverished class in Lebanon,” Ali said.
The cleric has repeatedly condemned Israel’s war in Gaza, saying that Hezbollah’s “supportive front” for the Palestinians will only intensify “the more Israel increases its aggression, especially when it targets civilians.”
But Qassem is unlikely to be “an absolute leader” for Hezbollah, Ali noted. “It is more likely that he will be a coordinator of the different voices in the organization,” he said, adding that this may not be intentional on the part of the group, given there were few options to choose from after Israel exacted “a generational coup” by killing most of Hezbollah’s old guard.",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/28/politics/bernie-sanders-kamala-harris-israel-gaza/index.html,Bernie Sanders makes the case for Kamala Harris to pro-Palestinian critics,2024-10-29 03:34:54,"Hopes for changing US policy in Israel and Gaza, the fight against climate change, the battle for abortion rights – all of it, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Monday night, would be dashed or defeated if Donald Trump wins reelection in November.
Vice President Kamala Harris, since becoming the Democratic nominee, has been challenged by pro-Palestinian, anti-war activists to either publicly advocate for conditioning military aid to Israel or, at a minimum, signal that she would break from President Joe Biden’s robust support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government.
On Monday night, Sanders placed himself among those critics as he made an impassioned case for Harris in a video posted to social media.
“I understand that there are millions of Americans who disagree with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the terrible war in Gaza. I am one of them,” the Vermont independent said, speaking directly to camera, before stating again that “Israel had a right to defend itself against a horrific Hamas terrorist attack of October 7.”
Sanders was one of the first federal lawmakers to call for a ceasefire in Gaza and, though he moved more cautiously than many left-wing activists hoped for, soon emerged as one of the most vocal critics of Netanyahu on Capitol Hill and a relentless advocate for a change in US policy. In September, he announced plans to file a Senate resolution blocking the sale of offensive weaponry to Israel.
“Some of you are saying, how can I vote for Kamala Harris if she is supporting this terrible war? And that is a very fair question,” Sanders said in the video, after recounting the bloody toll the conflict has taken on Palestinians in Gaza.
Harris, who first called for a temporary ceasefire during a speech at the annual commemoration of “Bloody Sunday” in Selma, Alabama, in March, and who backs a two-state solution in the region, has been under pressure for months from activists pleading with her to break from Biden.
During a brief meeting three weeks ago in Flint, Michigan, a group of Arab American advocates and leaders pressed Harris, as Wa’el Alzayat, the CEO of Muslim American advocacy group Emgage Action, told CNN afterward, “to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don’t agree with.”
Though she often reiterates her desire for an end to the war, occasionally in response to protesters interrupting her campaign speeches, Harris has stayed tight with Biden administration policy and talking points.
Making his case for Harris, Sanders argued – in short – that she can be convinced.
“I promise you, after Kamala wins, we will together do everything that we can to change US policy toward Netanyahu,” Sanders beseeched his viewers. “An immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, a surge of massive humanitarian aid, the stopping of settler attacks on the West Bank, and the rebuilding of Gaza for the Palestinian people.”
Before he spoke about Harris, though, Sanders asked voters to consider their options – starting with Trump.
“Donald Trump and his right-wing friends are worse,” Sanders said. “Trump has said Netanyahu is doing a good job and has said Biden is ‘holding him back.’ He has suggested that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beachfront property for development. And it is no wonder Netanyahu prefers to have Donald Trump in office.”
In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on the first anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack, Trump mused about real estate prospects in Gaza, home to roughly 2 million Palestinians before the war began.
“You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place – the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,” Trump said. “It could be so beautiful.”
Gaza dominated the message, but Sanders also pointed to Trump’s opposition to abortion rights, support for additional tax cuts for the rich and refusal to directly answer a question about whether he supports a rise in the minimum wage.
“If Trump wins, to be honest with you, the struggle against climate change is over,” Sanders said. “While virtually every scientist who has studied the issue understands that climate change is real and an existential threat to our country and the world, Trump believes it is a hoax.”
Released about 24 hours after Trump’s controversial Madison Square Garden rally finished, Sanders in the video talks about watching the event on television.
“We have tried (for years) to fight against bigotry, but that is exactly what we saw on display at that unbelievable Trump rally,” Sanders said, recalling progressive fights against institutional bigotry.
“It was not a question of speeches, getting up there, disagreeing with Kamala Harris on the issues. That wasn’t the issue at all. They were attacking her simply because she was a woman and a woman of color. Extreme vulgar sexism and racism.
“Is that,” Sanders asked, “really the kind of America that we can allow?”",['Gregory Krieg'],en

If the bill passes in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, this week, it will prohibit any Israeli official from providing services or dealing with employees of the UN Relief and Works Agency and forbid UNRWA from operating in Israel.
Several countries, including the US, have expressed concern over the impact of the bill.
The Israeli government has claimed that some of the UN Relief and Works Agency’s (UNRWA) staff are affiliated with Hamas. UNRWA has strongly denied the allegations, but several governments suspended funding for the agency earlier this year while the allegations were investigated.
The MP, Yulia Malinovsky, told CNN that US Ambassador Jacob Lew has contacted several opposition leaders, including Avigdor Lieberman, Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz, in an effort to get the legislation stopped.
She described the US pressure as unacceptable.
The US State Department told CNN that as a matter of policy, it would not comment on private diplomatic conversations.
But it said that the proposed legislation would make it impossible for UNRWA to operate and would leave a “vacuum that Israel would then be responsible for filling.” A spokesman said UNRWA provided vital services in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon and Jordan.
UNRWA has long been a target of Israeli criticism and relations between Israel and the UN have slumped amid the war in Gaza.
Last week, the spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the IDF had killed a commander of the Hamas ‘Nukhba’ force who had also been employed by UNRWA since July 2022.
Subsequently, Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted on X that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had “reached new heights of hypocrisy and insensitivity. Last night, he lamented the elimination of their ‘UNRWA colleague’ by IDF forces in Gaza.”
In a letter sent to two senior members of the Israeli government earlier this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Biden administration was “deeply concerned” about the potential adoption of the bill.
Malinovsky told CNN that she is determined UNRWA should no longer receive “five-star treatment” in Israel. She says she has wide support in the Israeli parliament for the measure.
“UNRWA colluded with Hamas, it is educating kids to hate Israel and spreading antisemitism, it is selling them stories that they will be able to come back to Israel. This will not happen,” Malinovsky said.
UNRWA says it insists on the neutrality of its staff and said the allegations made by Israel about 66 employees out of 30,000 staff amounted to just 0.22% of its payroll.
“There is absolutely no ground for a blanket description of ‘the institution as a whole’ being ‘totally infiltrated,’” the agency said in May.
Most parties in the Knesset appear poised to back the bill. The leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, declined to comment about private conversations but his office told CNN that UNRWA “played an active role in the brutal massacre on October 7. From its institutions terrorist attacks against Israel were launched…..”
Former war cabinet member Benny Gantz posted on X last week that UNRWA “chose to make itself an inseparable component of Hamas’ mechanism – and now is the time to detach ourselves entirely from it.”
On Saturday, the foreign ministers of Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the UK expressed “grave concern” over the legislation.
They said that without UNRWA’s work, the provision of assistance “including education, health care, and fuel distribution in Gaza and the West Bank would be severely hampered if not impossible.”","['Dana Karni', 'Tim Lister']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,Israel launched strikes on Iran in a retaliatory attack. Here’s what we know,2024-10-26 00:00:00,"Israel said on Saturday it had struck military targets inside Iran in response to earlier Iranian attacks, again raising fears that the long-running confrontation between the two powerful militaries could escalate into an all-out regional war that draws in the United States.
The Israeli military said it had targeted Iranian missile manufacturing sites and aerial defense systems in what appeared to be a highly calculated response that avoided critical energy infrastructure, such as oil fields and nuclear facilities.
Calling the strikes a “clear violation” of international law, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend itself.”
But Iran also appeared to downplay the impact, claiming its air defenses had successfully countered the strikes in three provinces – Tehran, Ilam and Khuzestan – and that the damage was “limited.”
The Iranian army said Saturday morning that two soldiers were killed in the strikes, without clarifying where the deaths happened. The Iranian soldiers died “confronting the projectiles of the criminal Zionist entity,” a reference to Israel, the army said in a statement, which was published on state media.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel’s strikes on Iran had severely damaged its defense capabilities, without providing further details on what was targeted.
“Two days ago, we hit the head of the octopus. To the people of Iran I say - our struggle is against a tyrannical regime that threatens the entire region. Whoever hurts us, we hurt them.”
The US meanwhile described the attack as “an exercise in self-defense” that “specifically avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets.”
Israel had vowed Iran would pay for its large-scale missile attack on October 1 that saw around 200 missiles fired at Israel, forcing people across the country to take cover in bomb shelters. For weeks Israeli leaders have been deliberating on the nature and scope of such a response.
Here’s what we know.
What happened?
In the early hours of Saturday local time, Israel launched direct airstrikes against Iran, conducting what it said was “precise strikes on military targets.”
The Israeli military said its air force struck “missile manufacturing facilities” that it said were used to produce the missiles that Iran had fired at Israel over the last year.
It also said the Israeli military struck “surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran.” It is unclear if those manufacturing facilities also produced missiles launched by Iranian proxies Hezbollah, Hamas and Houthi rebels in Yemen.
Iran later confirmed the attack but said the strikes caused only “limited damage” in some areas, while images broadcast on state media showed the calmness on the streets of the capital Tehran.
Iran’s state news agency reported strikes targeting “military centers in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam” had been “successfully intercepted.”
Several explosions were heard west of Tehran around 2:15 a.m. local time (7 p.m. ET Friday), according to the state news agency. Iranian officials said blasts heard around the country were related to air defense systems being deployed.
The initial strikes were closely followed by a second wave, as video posted to social media by Tehran residents showed tracer fire and explosions illuminating the Iranian capital’s sky as dawn neared. A third and final wave then followed.
By about 6 a.m. local time, the Israeli military said it has concluded its operation, saying the “mission was fulfilled” and Israeli jets “have safely returned home.”
How did we get here?
Saturday’s strikes are part of Israel’s long-awaited retaliation to Iran’s missile attack earlier this month, as the ongoing war in the Middle East continues to escalate to dangerous new levels.
On October 1, Iran launched 200 projectiles towards Tel Aviv and Israeli military bases in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others, its largest ever such attack.
That missile barrage came about 24 hours after Israel launched a ground war in Lebanon, opening a new front in its war against Iranian-backed militants.
Israel and Iran have been fighting a shadow war through proxies and covert actions for decades. In April, that war came out into the open when Iran launched a wave of drones and missiles at Israel in an unprecedented attack in response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria.
In recent weeks, Israel has ramped up its attacks against Iran’s proxies, including launching strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria.
But it’s in Lebanon where Israel has refocused its operations after tit-for-tat strikes across the border escalated after Israel eliminated the leadership of Iran-backed Hezbollah in series of assassinations and airstrikes.
Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike on his underground headquarters in Beirut in September. Netanyahu had previously said his killing was “a necessary step” toward changing “the balance of power in the region for years to come.”
Israel’s war in Lebanon has since killed more than 2,500 people, displaced 1.2 million and created a unprecedented humanitarian crisis, according to Lebanon’s leader and international health officials.
In a statement issued at the outset of Saturday’s actions, the Israeli military accused Iran and its regional proxies of relentlessly attacking Israel beginning with last year’s 7 October attack by Iran-allied Hamas, during which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 abducted.
Following the October 7 attacks, Israel declared war on Hamas and launched military operations in Gaza that have killed more than 42,000 people.
The UN’s human rights chief warned Friday that “one of the darkest moments” of the war is unfolding in the north of Gaza where the Israeli military is “subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and starvation.”
What happens next?
A major concern of increasing military escalations is that Israel and Iran will become entangled in a full-scale war, one that risks drawing the US – Israel’s closest ally and biggest weapons supplier – into the fray.
A senior US administration official said President Biden has “encouraged” Netanyahu last week to “design” a retaliatory attack that would “deter future attacks against Israel.”
In recent weeks, the US and other allies have urged Netanyahu to exercise restraint and avoid striking Iran’s nuclear and oil assets.
The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, expressed similar concerns as an attack on Iranian oil facilities could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN.
The White House said the US “was not a participant in this operation” and urged “Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.”
By refraining from attacking Iran’s oil or nuclear sites, Israel has potentially left room for de-escalation. But it is unclear whether Iran will respond to this latest attack.
Israel’s top military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said after the conclusion of strikes that if Iran were to begin “a new round of escalation,” Israel will be “obligated to respond.”",['Helen Regan'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-iran-conflict-deescalation-analysis-intl/index.html,The US wants this to be ‘the end’ of direct Israel-Iran fire. It may be too soon to tell,2024-10-26 00:00:00,"After Israel’s attack on Iran Saturday, US officials were quick to caution both countries against perpetuating the cycle of violence, but analysts say lasting de-escalation is not a foregone conclusion.
The airstrikes “should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,” a senior US administration official said after the attacks.
After reports emerged of explosions heard in Tehran, Israel in a statement said it launched what it described as “precise strikes on military targets in Iran” early Saturday. The strikes were in response to Iran’s barrage of missiles fired at Israel on October 1, in retaliation to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others.
Iran said Israel “attacked parts of military centers” on Saturday in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, causing “limited damage” in some areas.
Iran appeared to have downplayed the Israeli strike, Iranian experts said. State media broadcast images showing calm on the streets of Tehran, with traffic moving and people going about their daily business.
Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the attack, calling it “clear violation” of international law. The ministry added that Iran “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend itself” after the Israeli strikes.
Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, said Iran’s downplayed response may be “more reflective of their desire to de-escalate than a true assessment of the damage Israel inflicted on Iran,” like Israel’s attempts to hide damage caused by Iran’s October 1 attack.
Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense for Democracies, also based in DC, said Iran’s downplayed response may be “a strategic move to save face and keep US constraint on Israel.”
After several hours of strikes Saturday, the Israeli military said it had targeted manufacturing sites used to produce missiles that Iran has fired at Israel over the past year. Israel also said it hit Iranian aerial defense systems early Saturday to allow its aircraft to attack the other targets.
Israel’s decision to strike early Saturday morning came after weeks of deliberations within its security cabinet about the nature and scope of such an attack, Israeli officials said.
American officials have been keen to show the extent to which Israel’s attack was restrained and precise, especially as the US pushed Israel not to attack Iran’s energy infrastructure, for fear of igniting a broader conflict, a request Israel seems to have heeded, according to preliminary reports.
After Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran ended, National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said the White House urges “Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.”
But Israel has not always met the demands of its American ally. Throughout the war, Israel has defied the US’ calls for restraint – on the Rafah operation in southern Gaza, and more recently on a ground war in southern Lebanon.
Disagreements between the two governments culminated in an October 13 letter from the US to Israel, demanding the Jewish state act to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy.
Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow with the Iran Program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a retired Israel Defense Intelligence officer who specialized in Iran, said it was too early to predict how the coming hours and days will unfold. “But one thing is clear,” he said, “Israel and Iran came closer than ever last night to the brink of direct war.”
“The ball is now in the Iranian leadership’s court,” Citrinowicz said on X, adding that the Iranian regime likely faces a familiar dilemma: to strike back for reputational gains, or take Israel’s attack as an end to the direct conflict.
Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that “if Iran chooses to exercise restraint… then this chapter may be closed, yet the conflict will remain very much alive.”
When Iran chose restraint after Israel’s retaliation in April, it emboldened the Jewish state to take out key Hezbollah leaders in Beirut, which triggered the next cycle of aggression.
Experts say that while Israel presses on with its wars in Gaza and Lebanon, any pause in direct fighting between Iran and Israel is likely to be short-lived.
As long as those regional wars persist, the overall trajectory of the Israel-Iran conflict will escalate. “While we may see some tactical de-escalation, the trajectory remains escalatory,” Parsi said, adding “a new exchange of fire between Israel and Iran will only be a question of time,” with the next round likely to be “more ferocious.”
Israel has long tried to push Iran and other Iranian proxies back into deterrence. But experts say Israel’s strategy may not be entirely effective.
“Iran will not be deterred from escalating in the future if it so sees fit, neither would Israel,” H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London, told CNN’s Paula Newton, adding that deterrence is often used as an excuse by the attacking state, but only leads to more regional instability.
“It doesn’t de-escalate through escalation,” he said, “which is the most incredible thing I’ve heard.”",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

After days of laying siege to the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, the Israeli military twice entered the hospital compound over the past 24 hours and opened fire at parts of the complex, the Gaza health ministry and the hospital director told CNN.
The facility is running low on supplies and is in desperate need of aid as injured people from neighboring areas pour in following Israel’s renewed offensive in northern areas, according to health authorities.
“One of the darkest moments of the Gaza conflict is unfolding in the north of the Strip,” the UN’s human rights chief Volker Turk said Friday.
“The Israeli military is effectively subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation, as well as being forced to choose between mass displacement and being trapped in an active conflict zone,” he added, warning that Israel’s actions could amount to crimes against humanity.
Gaza’s health ministry said Saturday that Israeli troops have detained all male medical staff at the hospital “while confining women in one of the hospital rooms without water or food.”
World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that since the raid on Kamal Adwan hospital, WHO has “lost touch with the personnel there.”
“This development is deeply disturbing given the number of patients being served and people sheltering there,” Ghebreyesus said on X. Prior to Friday’s raid, he said, WHO and its partners managed to reach Kamal Adwan “amid hostilities in the vicinity, and transferred 23 patients and 26 caregivers to Al-Shifa Hospital.”
Ghebreyesus said later Saturday that Israel’s raid on the hospital was over, but came “at a heavy cost.” After 44 male staff members detained, the hospital’s female staff, the hospital director and one other male doctor were left to care for “nearly 200 patients in desperate need of medical attention,” said Ghebreyesus.
Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospital director, said in a video that Israeli tanks and bulldozers entered the hospital compound late Thursday and began firing at parts of the complex, adding that “all departments of the hospital are under direct shelling.”
“Instead of receiving aid, we are receiving tanks,” he said.
After an hours-long communications blackout and “intense bombardment,” Safiya told CNN late Friday that Israeli troops were still present in the hospital.
“We all gathered in one place, and then the army called for me. When I went down, they put me inside a tank and began interrogating me about my statements and contact with the media,” Abu Safiya recounted.
He said the Israeli military were “searching all the rooms, evacuating the displaced people and removing 44 staff members” as he spoke.
“The situation is extremely tragic and terrifying, and the bombing is continuous,” Abu Safiya said.
Kamal Adwan is one of three minimally operational hospitals in northern Gaza, and the closest to Israeli military activity in Beit Lahiya and the Jabalya Refugee Camp. Despite its limited capacity, it has been receiving most of the injured from the surrounding fighting.
The Israeli military said in a statement Friday that its forces are operating in the area of the Kamal Adwan Hospital “based on intelligence information regarding the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure,” adding that in the weeks preceding the operation, “the IDF facilitated the evacuation of patients from the area while maintaining emergency services.”
COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages the flow of aid into the strip, said on Friday that with the help of UNICEF and WHO, several patients and their escorts were evacuated from the facility. The hospital was also given fuel, blood units and medical equipment.
‘Shocked by the entry of bulldozers and tanks’
Maher Shamiya, an official with the Gaza health ministry, told CNN Friday that the Israeli military had demolished parts of the hospital’s wall. The oxygen station had also been damaged by Israeli fire, he said.
Shamiya said that the military had entered the hospital yard for a second time on Friday morning and had begun separating men from women.
“After that, it became impossible to communicate with anyone.”
In his video message, Safiya said he was “shocked by the entry of bulldozers and tanks into the hospital compound,” adding that tanks began firing at the upper floors, shattering windows and “creating an atmosphere of panic, terror, and fear.”
“Everyone in the hospital gathered in the stairwell; it was a very distressing scene,” he said.
One video showed Abu Safiya speaking from within the Intensive Care Unit, where patients and medical staff were huddled. He said that some severely injured people were dying. Abu Safiya said that a number of properties around the hospital had been set on fire.
Later Thursday night, a convoy of supplies from the World Health Organization reached the hospital, he said. Video showed a fuel tanker and other vehicles close to the facility.
Abu Safiya said the convoy delivered enough fuel for five days, as well as 200 units of blood and a few other supplies, but no food or water.
He said he had been in touch with Israeli officers.
“I explained the situation of the patients and the injured people in the hospital, emphasizing that their condition was extremely critical and that evacuation was necessary.”
The health ministry in Gaza told CNN Friday that 23 injured people had been evacuated in six ambulances. Abu Safiya said there were 70 critically injured people at the hospital needing evacuation.
Abu Safiya also told CNN that there was a large number of injured people in the Jabalya area of northern Gaza, which has been subjected to intense Israeli military operations in recent days.
“We have no medical assistance that can reach them, and I do not have the means to help them even if they were able to reach us. We have nothing to offer them.”
It has been 21 days since Israel ramped up its military operation in northern Gaza. Authorities in Gaza say the military has stopped aid from reaching parts of the area and displaced many of its residents. Israel says it is preventing Hamas from regrouping.",[],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/25/middleeast/more-than-130-israeli-reservists-sign-letter-refusing-to-fight-in-gaza-and-lebanon/index.html,More than 130 Israeli reservists sign letter refusing to fight in Gaza and Lebanon,2024-10-25 05:01:48,"When Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 last year, reservist Yotam Vilk wasn’t called up for military service – he volunteered to go and fight. Since then, he has spent more than 230 days serving with the Israeli military in Gaza.
It has affected every part of his life. And now, he is refusing to serve again.
“On October 7, I didn’t hesitate… because my people were murdered and killed and I understood that there was a need to save them, and there is still a need to save them, which the Israeli government doesn’t seem to see as urgent,” he told CNN in a phone interview.
After completing his second round of reserve duty in Gaza this summer, he decided he would refuse to go back if he were asked. He believed military action was justified in some cases, but that it should only be used as a tool to reach diplomatic solutions that work towards peace.
He didn’t believe in the government’s will to achieve that, despite “the destruction in Gaza getting harder, the lives of Palestinians getting harder and the lives of Israeli hostages getting harder.”
On October 9, Vilk, along with more than 130 other Israeli reservists, signed an open letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stating that they refuse to serve unless a deal is signed to end the war and bring back the 101 hostages still in Gaza.
‘For some of us, the red line has already been crossed, and for others, it is rapidly approaching: the day when, with broken hearts, we will stop reporting for service,’ the letter read.
Vilk’s “red line” had been crossed, but it wasn’t an easy decision to make.
On the one hand, by refusing to serve, he felt he would be abandoning the hostages and leaving Hamas in charge in Gaza, something he believes makes Palestinians’ lives worse.
On the other, by not refusing, he feared he’d be serving in a war that would end in another Israeli occupation of Gaza, of which he didn’t want to be a part.
Despite Netanyahu stating there would be no resettlement in Gaza, Vilk said the government’s support for the expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank made him doubtful of his intentions. Netanyahu’s cabinet includes far-right ministers who have called for Israeli settlements in Gaza.
“They put me in a horrible position… I feel betrayed by my own government,” he said.
And he isn’t alone.
Max Kresch served on Israel’s border with Lebanon for 66 days after October 7. Hostilities in the border region intensified as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed support for Hamas in Gaza. Now, Kresch says he’s had enough. When he returned to his home in Jerusalem at the end of December, he says he had a hard time readjusting and fell into a deep depression.
Serving was very difficult for him, Kresch said, because the atmosphere felt very “religiously militaristic.”
“A very significant portion of the people that I was with felt religiously inspired to be fighting in this war, which was extremely uncomfortable for me,” he said.
He recalled one soldier telling him he believed it was a mitzvah, or Jewish religious duty, to kill Palestinians in Gaza, including children, “because they would grow up to be terrorists.”
Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has voiced similar sentiments. Kresch said he finds it “terrifying” that Ben Gvir has a significant voice in the country that resonates with a lot of people.
Despite some comrades holding extreme views that were “very difficult to hear and tolerate,” Kresch believed they were good people, making the choice he made very difficult – and lonely.
By signing the letter, he isn’t trying to discourage others from serving he said, but to support those who have already decided not to.
Fears over ‘forever war’
Kresch’s concerns came to a head as Israel marked a year since the October 7 attack, a milestone he saw as the straw that broke the camel’s back.
“We’re a year in, and we still haven’t had a hostage deal… but doing a deal isn’t going to mean I’m OK and suddenly ready to go back. The camel’s back is broken. It takes a lot more to heal that back,” he said.
Another 28-year-old reservist, who asked to remain anonymous because he didn’t want the families of soldiers who died to feel betrayed by his decision to refuse, served in Gaza for over 130 days. He felt the weight of the anniversary as well.
“The military pressure has been overwhelming for a bit more than a year now, and I don’t think any more military action is going to change the situation,” he told CNN.
Like Kresch and Vilk, he believed it was necessary to fight Hamas on October 7, but to what end?
“We can always keep bombing Gaza… I won’t even talk about the civilian cost, because people in Israel shut down when we talk about it. But the utilitarian cost. There’s no point in fighting a war that could last forever,” he said.
The “forever war” has become a slogan used by opponents of Netanyahu to describe what they believe is his desire to keep it going for his own political gains. Netanyahu has vowed that Israel will “continue to fight” until its enemies are defeated, the hostages are returned, and Israelis can go back to their homes in the south and north.
Last month, Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon to begin the “next phase” of the war against Hezbollah.
The 28-year-old reservist is from a town in northern Israel that has been hit by Hezbollah rockets over the past year. He feels strongly that Israel needs to go after the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, but fears it takes the focus away from Gaza and bringing back the hostages.
Kresch, who served on the border last year, believed at the time Hezbollah was a threat that needed to be deterred. But now, he thinks Netanyahu has “leveraged” Israel’s collective trauma “for political gain.”
‘No place for refusals’
This isn’t the first time since the Hamas attacks that reservists have declared their refusal to serve. Back in May, more than 40 reservists signed a letter after Israeli forces invaded the southern Gazan city of Rafah.
But for this new letter, that number has more than doubled, and the stakes are much higher as Israel wages war on multiple fronts.
Transportation Minister Miri Regev, speaking to Kann News, called for those who signed it to be detained.
“There is no place for refusals in the army. Not from the right and not from the left,” she said.
A few days after the letter was published, Kresch told CNN he received a call from the officer responsible for calling up reservists in his unit. The officer asked him to take back what he’d said or vowed not to call him back to reserves, Kresch said.
“It was kind of a ‘you’re not breaking up with me, I’m breaking up with you’ conversation, with a hint of ‘we can still fix this,’” Kresch recalled.
“I said I stand by what I signed… as far as I’m concerned, this cannot be fixed under Netanyahu and whoever comes in afterwards will have a lot of work to do in repairing the broken trust,” Kresch said.
Vilk says he received a call from his brigade commander a week after the letter was published, threatening to remove him from his position.
He served as a deputy company commander in Gaza, and despite refusing to serve, still holds that position. Vilk said the brigade commander claimed he was not allowed to speak against the government, because it was a violation of army orders.
“I still don’t know how it will unfold,” Vilk told CNN, adding that he wasn’t concerned about repercussions.
“I’m more concerned about my moral decisions and my well-being and my ability to look back and believe that I made the right choices and that I was on the right side of history,” he said.
The 28-year-old reservist said he feels the same way. He wasn’t expecting the letter to gain momentum, and only hoped that it would do good.
“My conflict is not at all with people who choose to go… it’s about following orders when it helps our country and when it helps us save lives, and not following orders when we don’t need to because they’re harmful and dangerous,” he said.
“War is a bad thing. We should try to make it as short as possible. And right now, it seems like war has become the target for our leaders, it is not serving any purpose, it is the purpose itself.”",['Zeena Saifi'],en

The soldier, who said his unit held two Palestinian prisoners for the explicit purpose of using them as human shields to probe dangerous places, said the practice was prevalent among Israeli units in Gaza.
“We told them to enter the building before us,” he explained. “If there are any booby traps, they will explode and not us.”
It was so common in the Israeli military that it had a name: “mosquito protocol.”
The exact scale and scope of the practice by the Israeli military is not known. But the testimony of both the soldier and five civilians shows that it was widespread across the territory: in northern Gaza, Gaza City, Khan Younis, and Rafah.
The soldier explained that, at first, his unit, which at the time was in northern Gaza, used standardized procedures before entering a suspect building: sending in a dog or punching a hole through its side with a tank shell or an armored bulldozer.
But one day this spring, the soldier said an intelligence officer showed up with two Palestinian detainees – a 16-year-old boy and 20-year-old man – and told the troops to use them as human shields before entering buildings. The intelligence officer claimed they were connected to Hamas.
When he questioned the practice, the soldier said one of his commanders told him, “‘It’s better that the Palestinian will explode and not our soldiers.’”
“It’s quite shocking, but after a few months in Gaza you [tend not to] think clearly,” the soldier said. “You’re just tired. Obviously, I prefer that my soldiers live. But, you know, that’s not how the world works.”
The soldier said that he and his comrades refused to carry on with the practice after two days and confronted their senior commander about it. Their commander, who first told them not to “think about international law,” saying that their own lives were “more important,” ultimately relented, releasing the two Palestinians, the soldier said.
The fact that they were released, he said, made it clear to him that they had no affiliation with Hamas, “that they are not terrorists.”
CNN was connected with the soldier by Breaking the Silence, an organization that provides a forum for Israeli soldiers to speak out and verifies their testimony.
Breaking the Silence provided CNN with three photos depicting the Israeli military using Palestinians as human shields in Gaza. One haunting photograph shows two soldiers urging a civilian forward in a scene of devastation in northern Gaza. In a second, two civilians used as human shields sit bound and blindfolded. A third shows a soldier guarding a bound civilian.
In a statement, the Israeli military told CNN: “The IDF’s directives and guidelines strictly prohibit the use of detained Gaza civilians for military operations. The relevant protocols and instructions are routinely clarified to soldiers in the field during the conflict.”
International law forbids the use of civilians to shield military activity, or to forcibly involve civilians in military operations. The Israeli Supreme Court explicitly banned the practice in 2005, after rights groups filed a complaint about the military’s use of Palestinian civilians to knock on the doors of suspected militants in the West Bank. Justice Aharon Barak at the time called the practice “cruel and barbaric.”
Israel has long accused Hamas of using civilians in Gaza as human shields, embedding military infrastructure in civilian areas – allegations Hamas has denied. There is ample evidence for it: weapons located inside homes, tunnels dug beneath residential neighborhoods and rockets fired from those same neighborhoods in the densely packed territory.
The Israeli military frequently cites those practices in blaming Hamas for the extraordinary civilian death toll in Gaza, where Israel has dropped bombs on those same residential areas. Israeli attacks have killed more than 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza since October last year, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The United Nations says that most of the dead are civilians.
“We saw Hamas using Palestinians as human shields,” the soldier said. “But for me it’s more painful with my own army. Hamas is a terrorist organization. The IDF shouldn’t use terrorist organization practices.”
‘Mosquito protocol’
Interviews with five Palestinian former detainees in Gaza tally with the soldier’s account. All describe being captured by Israeli troops and forced to enter potentially dangerous places ahead of the military.
Israeli airstrikes earlier this year forced Mohammad Saad, 20, from his home in Jabalya, in northern Gaza. From his makeshift home near Khan Younis, between blankets strung from rafters, Saad explained that he was picked up by the Israeli military near Rafah, while attempting to get food aid for him and his younger brothers.
“The army took us in a jeep, and we found ourselves inside Rafah in a military camp,” he said, adding that he was held there for 47 days, and during that time was used for reconnaissance missions to avoid putting Israeli soldiers at risk.
“They dressed us in military uniforms, put a camera on us, and gave us a metal cutter,” he said. “They would ask us to do things like, ‘move this carpet,’ saying they were looking for tunnels. ‘Film under the stairs,’ they would say. If they found something, they would tell us to bring it outside. For example, they would ask us to remove belongings from the house, clean here, move the sofa, open the fridge, and open the cupboard.”
The soldiers were terrified, he explained, of hidden explosives.
“I usually wore the military uniform, but for the final mission, they took me in civilian clothing,” Saad said. “We went to a location, and they told me I had to film a tank left behind by the Israeli army. I was terrified and scared to film it, so they hit me on the back with the butt of a rifle.”
Bullets rang out as he approached the tank, and Saad said he was shot through the back. Miraculously, he survived, and was taken to Soroka Medical Center, in Israel. When he was interviewed by CNN two weeks later in Khan Younis, he lifted his shirt to show the wound where the bullet entered his back.
Not all the Palestinians used were adults. Mohammad Shbeir, 17, said that he was taken captive by Israeli soldiers after they killed his father and sister during a raid on their home in Khan Younis.
“I was handcuffed and wearing nothing but my boxers,” he recalled. “They used me as a human shield, taking me into demolished houses, places that could be dangerous or contain landmines.”
Dr. Yahya Khalil Al-Kayali, 59, was like so many others displaced over and over after being forced from his home in Gaza City. He eventually found himself living near Al Shifa Hospital, once Gaza’s largest medical complex, joining thousands of internally displaced civilians who took up shelter there.
In March, the Israeli military laid siege to that medical complex for a third time, alleging that Hamas was using it as a command center – something that Hamas denied. Huge numbers of men were swept up in the two-week-long raid, which left the hospital destroyed and inoperable. Al-Kayali was among them.
“The leader of this group, the soldier, asked me to come,” Al-Kayali recalled from the Mawasi area of Khan Younis, by a beach tent encampment. “He was talking to me in English. And he asked me to go out of the building to find any open holes or tunnels under the ground.”
Along a row of apartment buildings, again and again, the soldiers told Al-Kayali to enter every room of every apartment and check for militants and booby traps. The canons of Israeli tanks stood ready to fire, he said, should Hamas fighters be uncovered.
“I was thinking that I would be killed or die within minutes,” he recalled. “I was thinking about my family. Because there is no time to think about many things. But I was worried also about my kids, because my kids and my family were in the building.”
To his relief, the buildings were empty, and he was released. In the end, he said, he was forced to check as many as 80 apartments.
All the Palestinians interviewed by CNN were eventually released after being used as human shields, and the soldier said that those detained by his unit were also let go.
But after the soldier left Gaza, he said he heard from his comrades that the so-called “mosquito protocol” had resumed in his unit.
“My own soldiers who refused it in the beginning were back to using this practice,” he said. “They have no strength like they had in the beginning.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/us-israel-warn-potential-attack-sri-lanka/index.html,"Arugam Bay, Sri Lanka: US and Israel warn of potential attack on tourist locations in coastal area",2024-10-23 16:09:15,"Both the United States and Israel issued security alerts Wednesday warning of a potential attack on tourist locations in a coastal area of Sri Lanka.
The US Embassy alert advised they had received “received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations in the Arugam Bay area.”
“Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice,” it said, noting that US citizens “are strongly urged to avoid the Arugam Bay area until further notice.”
Israel’s alert from its National Security Council calls on Israeli citizens to “immediately leave Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka.” Israel raised its travel advisory level for Sri Lanka due to “credible terrorism threats at the tourist and coastal areas,” it said.
“The travel alert for Arugam Bay and the coastal areas in south and west Sri Lanka (including for the cities Ahangame, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama) has been raised to level 4,” it stated. “We recommend leaving these areas immediately. For those currently in these areas, we recommend leaving the country or at least traveling to the capital city Colombo, where there is heavier presence of local security forces.”
The alert also advises Israeli citizens to “avoid openly exhibiting anything that could identify you as Israeli, such as t-shirts with Hebrew writing, or any symbol that discloses your religion or nationality.”
Neither of the alerts goes into more specifics about the nature of the potential attack. There have been protests in Buddhist majority Sri Lanka against Israel’s war in Gaza. However, there have not been any major terrorist attacks in the nation since the 2019 Easter Sunday attack, when suicide bombers launched a coordinated series of attacks on three Catholic churches and three luxury hotels across Sri Lanka, killing 270 people and injuring 500 more.",['Jennifer Hansler'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/netanyahu-endgame-israel-gaza-lebanon-intl/index.html,Nobody knows what Netanyahu’s endgame is,2024-06-08 00:00:00,"When Israeli forces killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, many inside and outside of Israel hoped it could be the moment Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would declare a victory and scale back the Gaza operation in hopes of securing a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
A week after Sinwar’s death, it is increasingly clear they have been wrong.
Netanyahu, who celebrated his 75th birthday on Monday, is Israel’s longest serving prime minister, steering his country through its longest ever war.
Israel’s international allies, as well as many inside the country, are pressuring Netanyahu to end that war now, pointing out that Sinwar’s killing came off the back of other military successes, most notably the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
But instead, Netanyahu has vowed to continue to fight, leaving the world guessing what his ultimate goal might be.
He has hinted that his ambitions might go well beyond crushing Hamas and Hezbollah, the two most immediate threats Israel is facing. He said Nasrallah’s killing was “a necessary step” toward changing “the balance of power in the region for years to come,” raising concerns about his willingness to plunge Israel into a direct confrontation with Iran.
Israel and Iran are dangerously close to yet another major escalation after Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1.
Netanyahu immediately promised retaliation, but three weeks later, the world is still waiting to see what Israel will do next. The US and other allies have urged Netanyahu to exercise restrain and avoid striking Iran’s nuclear and oil assets, but it is unclear whether they succeeded.
Netanyahu has publicly stated that he wants his military to eliminate Iran’s proxies that pose the most immediate threat to Israel: Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. But it is increasingly obvious that might be impossible to achieve.
The current situation in northern Gaza shows why. The Israeli military has already withdrawn from the area twice after saying, both times, that it had crushed Hamas there. Yet earlier this month, the IDF went in again after seeing what it said were signs of Hamas re-emerging in the area.
Northern Gaza is now once again one of the epicenters of the war, with the IDF bringing immense amount of suffering on people who had returned to what was left of their homes after the last Israeli withdrawal.
Similarly, weeks into Israel’s operation in Lebanon, Hezbollah continues to strike. A drone fired over the weekend slipped through Israeli air defenses and struck Netanyahu’s beach house some 50 miles from the Lebanese border. On Monday, a drone fired launched Lebanon managed to get through Israeli’s air defences and strike Netanyahu’s beach house in the coastal city of Caesarea, some 50 miles from the border of Lebanon.
Netanyahu’s reluctance to strike a ceasefire deal, even now after securing several military victories, has angered many in Israel. Weekly mass protests against him and his government are back on, demanding an agreement with Hamas that would secure the release of the 101 hostages still held in Gaza.
Aviv Bushinsky, a former Netanyahu adviser and spokesperson who is now a political analyst, said the fate of the hostages – dozens of whom are still believed to be alive – is crucial for Netanyahu’s future legacy.
“If Netanyahu is not able to release any more hostages, either by military means or by diplomatic means, (people) are going to say he failed, and they will always remember what they call ‘The Netanyahu proposal’ in July where they said Netanyahu, at the last minute, added (a) few more conditions to a ceasefire agreement that effectively terminated the deal,” he said.
Bushinsky told CNN that if the war ends without any more hostages or bodies being released or rescued, it is possible some people could eventually start questioning the decision to kill Sinwar – something that was almost universally welcomed across Israel last week.
“And this is my greatest fear, that people will say, ‘oh, you see, we made a mistake by eliminating the single individual you could negotiate with … who knows what would have happened, but at least you had some kind of door to knock on’,” he added.
‘No incentive to end the war’
Netanyahu is playing a complicated game, trying to balance the contradictory demands of the many allies he cannot afford to lose.
His government relies on the support of far-right figures such as Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who make no secret of the fact that they want Israel to continue occupying Gaza and are even suggesting building Jewish settlements there.
Netanyahu’s approval ratings have improved over the last year, but not enough for him to be able to call a new election and win. So, he is stuck.
“Ending the Gaza war and the Lebanon war is not an option for his political partners in the coalition. They want to go all the way, so he cannot finish the war with the current coalition,” said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
“The usual Netanyahu that we’ve seen for the last 15 years would have probably gone for a national unity government and a big (ceasefire) agreement with the support of the US. But this is not the political situation we are actually in, so politically, with this coalition, he has no incentive to end the war,” she added.
Talshir explained that a broader national unity government is not an option for Netanyahu as it would likely mean a public inquiry, headed by a judge, into the failures that led to the October 7 attacks.
On top of that, Netanyahu is still on trial for several charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery. He is scheduled to begin testifying in December – the first sitting Israeli prime minister to appear in court as a defendant.
Before the October 7 terror attacks, Netanyahu and his government tried to push through a controversial judicial reform which would give much more power over courts to the government – potentially enabling Netanyahu to influence his own trial. A national unity government would not allow that, Talshir said.
Netanyahu’s legacy
At the same time, Netanyahu needs to consider the demands from the US. The Biden administration has made it very clear it wants Israel to work towards a deal that would end the war.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel on Tuesday, urging Netanyahu and his government to do more to cool the tensions.
But Netanyahu seems to have grown increasingly immune towards the pressures from the US – Blinken’s trip this week is his 11th visit to the Middle East in a year, yet like the previous trips, it seems to have achieved little.
Tensions between Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden are well documented, but they are likely to get a lot worse in the near future.
With the US election looking to be on a knife edge, Biden has to carefully calibrate his approach to Israel so as not to hurt Vice President Kamala Harris’s chances of winning. He needs to be seen as taking a tough stance on the horrific humanitarian situation in Gaza to stop Arab-Americans and progressives from ditching his party over the war Israel is waging there. Yet he must also continue to support Israel in order not to anger moderate and Jewish voters who expect the US to stand by the Jewish state no matter what.
“The American elections play a dramatic role in how Netanyahu perceives what’s going to happen,” Talshir told CNN. “He has a window of opportunity because there’s very little chance that Biden can restrain Netanyahu now. But after November 5, things are going to change,” she added.
She said that regardless of who wins, the Biden administration may exert a lot more pressure on Israel to end the war in the two months between the election and the inauguration of the new US president.
Biden has already hinted he might increase the pressure – warning Israel the US may stop supplying Israel with weapons unless the humanitarian situation in Gaza improves.
“Netanyahu knows that there is no bigger picture of victory afterwards, because both Sinwar and Nasrallah are dead. So the question is whether what he wants is to wait for (former President Donald) Trump (to get re-elected) and to get some sort of big defense alliance between the US, Saudi and Israel, which would be, from his perspective, probably more likely under Trump,” Talshir said, adding that striking such a deal would give Netanyahu a huge political boost at home.
“He is the head of state of Israel at the most devastating point since the state was established so the farther away he gets from October 7, and the more military victories that he gets under his belt, the more likely he is to reemerge as victorious,” she said.
For Netanyahu, establishing a legacy as the prime minister who saved his country is the dream, Bushinsky said, adding that if he managed that, he might even consider stepping down.
“Most people think that he won’t, but I worked with him and I have seen him once, in 2001, passing on the opportunity of being prime minister. Maybe he has changed, but I think that if he is able to end up as a big hero, someone who has done some kind of Churchillian act for the State of Israel, he would say to himself, enough is enough,” he said.
“And then his mission would be to strike some kind of a deal with the prosecution, maybe they’ll let him go and he will be able to go abroad, give lectures as the one who defeated terror … and if he won’t have any criminal record, he’ll be able to sit in all kinds of advisory boards and earn lots of money, which he feels that he’s lacking.”",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) said that without “lifting economic restrictions, enabling recovery, and investing in development, the Palestinian economy may not be able to restore pre-war levels and advance forward by relying on humanitarian aid alone.”
“Projections in this new assessment confirm that amidst the immediate suffering and horrific loss of life, a serious development crisis is also unfolding – one that jeopardizes the future of Palestinians for generations to come,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP administrator.
The UN report comes as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken visits the Middle East to “emphasize the need to chart a new path forward that enables Palestinians to rebuild their lives and realize their aspirations free from Hamas’s tyranny,” according to the State Department.
Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza on October 7 last year after the group attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. The Israeli offensive has killed more than 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there, displaced most of its people and flattened large swathes of the enclave.
The UN report, which looks at estimates for the Palestinian territories as a whole, says that over 4 million people in them were affected by poverty in 2024, including 2.6 million newly impoverished people.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.
But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.
CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.
“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.
Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.
The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Two of the UAVs were intercepted. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”
The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.
Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”
In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”
“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.
Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”
Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.
The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. But they have been designed and developed primarily to counter rockets and missiles, not drones that can be launched from anywhere, fly low and slow, and change direction quickly.
A deadly attack by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.
In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. No sirens were activated during that attack. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.
The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/blinken-israel-meetings/index.html,"Blinken urges Israel to capitalize on Sinwar’s killing to end Gaza war, but a breakthrough seems a long way off",2024-10-22 22:15:20,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday urged top Israeli officials to “capitalize” on the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death in order to secure the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza and bring the war there to a close – but there is little evidence that either of those aims are within close reach.
A US senior administration official, speaking after “a series of big, productive conversations” in Israel, said the top US diplomat “discussed in detail” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Secretary Yoav Gallant “the ways in which they can capitalize on what is a strategic success already, and some concrete steps that can be taken in between now and then that could effectively do that.”
Blinken was dispatched to the Middle East by President Joe Biden in the wake of the Hamas leader’s killing by the Israeli military last week. Even as US officials urge the Israeli government to make use of the “opportunity” created by Sinwar’s death, they have downplayed the prospect of a quick resumption of long-stalled hostage and ceasefire negotiations.
The Israeli readout of the Netanyahu-Blinken meeting also said that they discussed “the progress of the fighting in Gaza against the Hamas terrorist organization, and the supreme efforts that Israel is making to bring all of the hostages back home” without mentioning any push to bring the overall Gaza conflict to a swift close.
Israeli officials have given no public indication that they plan to soon end the war. Instead, they have continued their military campaign in northern Gaza that has left the area in dire and desperate need of humanitarian aid – a key topic of conversation in Blinken’s hours of meetings in Israel.
The potential for regional conflagration looms large over Blinken’s trip, which will continue on to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The senior administration official on Tuesday acknowledged that the impact of Sinwar’s death on hostage negotiations remains unclear, particularly amid uncertainty about who will succeed him to lead the group that is still believed to be holding dozens of people hostage in Gaza.
“I think the Israelis see that there is a potential opening,” the official said, “to try and restart, or explore what’s possible secure the recent release of hostages,” adding that the Israelis also have questions about who will be making decisions for Hamas going forward.
“That’s something we’re discussing, not just them, but also with, you know, Egyptian and Qatari partners as well. That is something that hopefully we’ll get more clarity on in the days ahead,” the official added.
The official said the Israelis expressed openness to seeing if there are other ideas “that could be put forward that would start to provide some sort of basis for hostage releases,” beyond the framework put forward by the US earlier this year. Though no details were provided about what those alternative ideas might be.
The US will look at whether Sinwar’s death presents an opportunity to revive that framework – “that Sinwar was a primary obstacle to,” the official said – or “is there an opportunity to look at other means of which we can accomplish those same fundamental goals, which are get everybody out, end the conflict, surge humanitarian aid.”
Blinken stressed need to allow more aid into Gaza
The need to increase humanitarian aid into Gaza was a “prominent topic” in Blinken’s meetings in Israel Tuesday, following a letter to the Israeli government last week demanding they improve the situation or potential face restrictions in military aid.
The top US diplomat directly raised questions with Netanyahu about whether the Israeli government was pursuing a policy of intentional starvation and killing the Palestinians who refused to leave northern Gaza – the so-called “General’s plan” reportedly pushed by far-right members of the government, the official said.
During the meeting, Netanyahu and his top advisor Ron Dermer made a “commitment” that it is not their policy, the official said. Blinken urged them to make that clear publicly.
“So if that’s not your policy, then you should make that clear. They said it is absolutely not our policy,” the official said.
The Israeli officials said that the perception that the “General’s plan” is their policy has been “deeply damaging to us,” the official said, adding that the US side urged them to “say that publicly.” But Blinken did not walk away with any commitments that Netanyahu plans to make any statements about this issue.
More broadly, in his meetings with top officials, Blinken “went through in detail” what he laid out in the letter last week.
“We heard more from Minister Gallant about – in detail – since he was one of the recipients of the letter about steps that he is overseeing to be responsive to it, but in both sides, both with the Prime Minister, with Minister (Ron) Dermer and with Minister Gallant, this was a central part of discussion,” the official said.
Notably, neither the Israeli readout of the Netanyahu or Gallant meeting mentioned humanitarian aid. The US senior administration official would not speak to the exclusion of the topic in those readouts.
Blinken “noted that we’ve seen progress in certain areas, but much more needs to be done, and more importantly, needs to be sustained,” the senior administration official said.
The official said the Israelis recognized “the seriousness with which we have expressed our concern about the current situation and are committed to responding to it and acting upon the requests or sort of priorities that we laid out.”
The official claimed that the Israeli officials “committed to us that they are acting upon our requests and doing everything that they can to meet them.”
“We take those commitments seriously. It’s the results that matter,” the official said, noting that the aid situation “has always been complicated.”
“The letter said we expected to see action and sustained action on this within 30 days,” they added. “We are still within that 30-day period. So that is a rough time frame in which we were operating under now and then we will assess, you know, once we get to that point, with the path forward.”","['Jennifer Hansler', 'Kylie Atwood']",en

Sign up here.
Growing unease over the United States’ inability to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East is prompting some of Washington’s closest Arab allies to significantly increase engagement with its primary regional adversary: Iran.
Over the past few months, Arab nations have been leveraging their revived relations with the Islamic Republic to ward off a wider regional war as the US fails to contain an impending regional escalation.
US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken landed in Israel for his eleventh trip to the region in a year on Tuesday in an apparent effort to take advantage of the killing of Hamas leader and October 7 architect Yahya Sinwar to reach a ceasefire in Gaza. US officials, however, are tempering expectations as Washington’s calls for calm fall on deaf ears and Israel vows to push ahead with its wars in Gaza and Lebanon.
Blinken’s visit also comes as Israel prepares a response to Tehran’s October 1 firing of hundreds of missiles in one of the biggest ever attacks on the Jewish state. The strike was in response to Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last month and its suspected killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.
Arab nations have long been suspicious of Shiite Iran’s role in a region that is dominated by US-allied Sunni states, and share Israel’s concerns about its support for non-state Islamist groups.
For the past month, Tehran has tried to gauge their position on its conflict with Israel, dispatching its top officials and diplomats for an intensive campaign of diplomacy with its neighbors, many of whom host US military personnel and bases. Arab nations that had spent decades brawling with Iran for regional influence are now opting to engage with it again.
Intensified diplomacy
In a rare meeting this month, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, who once called Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei the “new Hitler of the Middle East,” sat down with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Riyadh. It was the third meeting between Iranian and Saudi officials in one month. Tehran’s top diplomat also met Jordan’s King Abdullah II in Amman and made a rare trip to Egypt for a meeting with President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in Cairo. He has also met Qatar’s prime minister in Doha, the Omani foreign minister in Muscat and the Bahraini king in Manama.
Those efforts appeared to have borne fruit.
“All our friends gave us assurances that their land and airspace will not be used to attack Iran… We are expecting this from all countries in the region,” Araghchi said after meeting Kuwait’s Crown Prince Sabah Al-Sabah in Kuwait City.
Despite seeing an opportunity to weaken Iran’s regional influence, Arab nations are now signaling neutrality. A regional source told CNN last week the UAE’s airspace will not be used for any strike on the Islamic Republic.
“The Gulf (Arab) monarchies’ priority is not to be directly involved in a proper regional conflagration. They fear they would be targeted and would end up being directly hit in the crossfire,” said Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “They think the best way to avoid such a scenario is to make themselves very useful interlocutors for both sides and especially Iran, which is the most likely party to attempt hitting them.”
Israel’s actions in Lebanon and Gaza have significantly degraded Hezbollah and Hamas, groups that some Arab states and their media outlets have described as “terrorists.” While some Gulf Arab states may privately welcome the development, experts say they are very concerned about the potential of significant escalation in regional violence should Israel not be contained.
“In the immediate sense (Gulf states) are not unhappy to see Hezbollah weakened and decapitated, but given how reckless Israel has been, and how unclear its strategic goals are in the war, there are broader concerns about how their immediate neighborhood might end up looking once the bulk of the war is over,” Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, told CNN.
The Biden administration’s yearlong effort to mediate a ceasefire deal in Gaza and contain the violence in Lebanon has failed. The US has also struggled to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to de-escalate.
A ‘critical juncture’
Gulf Arab states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), two of the world’s top oil producers, have in recent years steered their foreign policies away from conflict to serve their economic interests, which has seen them repair ties with former adversaries like Iran. But they fear that an uncontained regional war could throw a wrench into their economic ambitions.
“At this critical juncture, the UAE believes a robust and effective American role is extremely necessary,” Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, told CNN this month. “We need a ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza as soon as possible.”
Gulf Arab nations that have come under attack several times from Iran-allied groups have grown skeptical of the US’ willingness to protect them if Iran strikes. Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities were hit in 2019 in an attack Washington blamed on Tehran, and the Iran-backed Houthi group in Yemen struck Abu Dhabi in 2022. The US did not intervene.
The UAE was disappointed by President Joe Biden’s de-designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization soon after he took office, and the US failure to re-designate it in the wake of the Abu Dhabi attacks. The US only reinstated the terror designation this year after group started attacking shipping in the Red Sea to punish Israel after October 7.
“The sentiment in the Gulf has certainly shifted,” Bianco said, adding that “the Gulf monarchies have lost faith in their primary security guarantor, the United States.”
The shift in sentiment is the result of what Gulf states see as a yearslong effort by the US to step back from the Middle East as it moves its focus to China. Still, regional states rely heavily on their military relationship with the US. Saudi Arabia is seeking a formalized security agreement with Washington and the UAE, which hosts some 5,000 US military personnel, is expected to become a major US defense partner.
Just a week before Hamas’ October 7 attack last year, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a discussion at the Atlantic Festival in Washington, D.C. that the Middle East “is quieter today than it has been in two decades.”
“The amount of time I have to spend on crisis and conflict in the Middle East today compared to any of my predecessors going back to 9/11 is significantly reduced,” he said, adding that the US’ efforts were focused on regional integration and normalization with Israel which “could create a greater and more stable foundation as we go forward.”",['Mostafa Salem'],en

The family was eating breakfast when pallets dropped from airplanes and careened towards the displacement area, the grandfather of the boy, who is also named Sami Ayyad, told CNN. Several family members attempted to take cover inside their improvised tents – but the falling parcel killed the three-year-old instantly, Ayyad recalled. Sami’s aunt and cousin were also wounded on their foot and face, respectively, Ayyad added.
“I was sitting here with the boy, and the moment I left him … the package fell on him,” Ayyad said. “There was only a second between me and him. I carried him and started running.
“We have no hospitals. I ran like crazy, but the boy died instantly. I couldn’t save him. Blood started coming out of his nose and mouth,” he added.
CNN footage from the aftermath shows blood stains on the ground, as Ayyad points to the area where he says Sami was killed. Family members can be seen congregating at the displacement camp, their eyes welling up with tears. Elsewhere, men, women and children walk barefoot among a sea of tents made of flimsy sheeting.
A number of countries have air-dropped aid into Gaza, including the United States, United Kingdom, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
“We don’t want aid. We want dignity,” said Ayyad. “Enough with the humiliation and insult that we are receiving from the Arabs, not just the Israelis. Those who have no mercy on us — look at our children, our women, our elderly.”
Sami’s uncle, Mohammad Ayyad, told CNN: “Our lives are… humiliation, death, horror. I sleep at night not sure if I will wake up.
“We are human beings, not animals to drop food (to) from the sky,” he added.
The United Arab Emirates airdropped 81 food packages into Khan Younis on Saturday, according to the Israeli agency which controls the flow of aid into Gaza. More than 10,000 packages have been airdropped in recent months, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, added.
CNN has reached out to the UAE for comment. CNN video from the displacement camp in Khan Younis on Saturday shows crates of aid, with the UAE flag stamped on cardboard boxes.
Israel’s sustained restrictions on aid entering the strip have sapped critical supplies, condemning the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine, according to a UN-backed report. About 1.84 million Palestinians are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to a report published Thursday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition.
But human rights agencies have repeatedly condemned airdrops as an inefficient way of getting aid to Palestinians in Gaza, instead urging Israeli authorities to lift controls on land crossings into the enclave. CNN has previously reported on aid drops killing people in search of food in Gaza.
Fikr Shalltoot, the Gaza director for the NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians, accused the Israeli government of “using starvation as a weapon of war across Gaza.”
“For a three-year-old boy to survive more than a year of Israeli military attacks, in what has been described by UN experts and the International Court of Justice as a potential genocide, to then be killed by an airdrop of food is a complete travesty,” Shalltoot said in a statement to CNN on Monday.
“Palestinians in Gaza have the right to more than meagre charity dropped from the sky.”
The Israeli military campaign in Gaza has leveled neighborhoods, erased entire families and spawned a crisis of severe hunger, displacement and disease. At least 42,603 Palestinians have been killed and another 99,795 injured since Israel launched its war in Gaza on October 7, the Ministry of Health there said on Monday.
Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
Sami and his loved ones had been staying in Khan Younis after they were displaced by the Israeli military campaign at least six times, according to his father, Mahmoud.
“I don’t want aid. My son is gone. He was standing there telling me to look at the parachutes. He ran away when he saw it coming close to him,” he told CNN on Saturday.
“There was an airstrike on people here, and he survived,” he added. “But his fate was to die from a parachute.”","['Abeer Salman', 'Mohammad Al Sawalhi', 'Ibrahim Dahman', 'Niamh Kennedy', 'Sana Noor Haq']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/politics/blinken-middle-east-hopes-receding/index.html,Blinken heads to Middle East with hopes receding for a quick diplomatic breakthrough following Sinwar’s death,2024-10-21 21:04:25,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken departed Monday for Israel and other unspecified countries in the Middle East as the United States seeks to move forward on efforts to resolve the conflict in the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.
American officials, led by President Joe Biden, remain staunchly hopeful diplomacy can eventually prevail — there is little alternative, they say — and have sought in their conversations with allies in the region to create momentum behind a new ceasefire push resulting in the release of hostages, even one with smaller ambitions than the three-phase proposal once on the table.
Yet days after Sinwar was killed by Israeli troops in southern Gaza, the fundamentals of the deadlocked talks remain unchanged.
There appears to be little clarity on who will take over the militant group, making it difficult to ascertain the probability of striking a new deal. Hamas has shown no inclination to change its stance on hostage and ceasefire negotiations.
“Their internal dynamics will take some time,” a regional diplomatic official told CNN. What does appear clear, the official said, is that Hamas isn’t budging on the ceasefire and hostage talks and will only consider going back to the three-phase deal that was under discussion for many months before Sinwar’s death.
US officials expect to learn more about who might be taking the reins for Sinwar over the course of the next week after Blinken’s engagements in the region.
Israel, meanwhile, has continued a relentless military campaign in northern Gaza in the days following Sinwar’s killing, and has shown no signs of letting up on its northern front in Lebanon. The specter of Israel’s response to Iran for Tehran’s missile attack earlier this month still looms, bringing with it the potential for regional conflagration.
Last week, Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone call it was time to “move on” from the Gaza war. But there is little evidence over the past year of Netanyahu taking Biden’s advice, and the Israeli premier has vowed since Sinwar’s death that the war is “not over.”
Israeli will “continue forward until the end,” Netanyahu said Saturday in brief remarks to Israeli media. Asked if anything would deter him, Netanyahu replied: “No, nothing will deter us. We continue until victory.”
The comments appeared to fly in the face of the Biden administration, which immediately started pushing the notion of a turning point in the fighting after Sinwar’s killing.
“We think that there’s a possibility of working to a ceasefire in Lebanon. And it’s going to be harder in Gaza, but we agree that there has to be an outcome: what happens the day after,” Biden told reporters at the end of last week.
Diplomats and allies skeptical
Even as Biden and his entire national security team publicly voiced optimism at bringing the Gaza war to an end following Sinwar’s death, US diplomats and regional allies are privately skeptical. Some question whether the lesson Israel took from Sinwar’s death is that American calls for de-escalation over the last several months were premature.
They are unsure exactly how the Biden administration plans to rally support for a post-war plan that has been in the works for the better part of the last year, particularly when the US elections are two weeks away and amid questions about who will pick up the baton for Sinwar.
Blinken, while in Israel, will discuss the day after plans for Gaza. While a senior State Department official said those talks have entered a new phase in recent weeks with specific details being discussed, there remains a major impediment: Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said, according to pool reports.
Some officials said they could foresee a new plan floated that calls instead for a temporary pause in fighting to allow the release of hostages, stopping short of an immediate ceasefire. Such a plan would also call for renewed talks toward a more permanent cessation of hostilities.
The White House was clear-eyed Monday about the status of a diplomatic outcome in Gaza or Lebanon, conceding that negotiations toward a ceasefire are not “about to restart.”
“I cannot sit here today and tell you that that negotiations are about to restart in Doha or Cairo or anywhere else for that matter,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.
Questions remain about the impact of Sinwar’s death, both in efforts to bring home the hostages held by Hamas and ending the wider regional tensions.
Negotiations had all but collapsed mere weeks ago, and US officials have downplayed the prospect of their quick resumption — in part because it’s unclear who would act as Hamas’s ultimate decision maker when and if negotiations resume.
The regional diplomatic source called it a “safe bet” that Sinwar’s brother Mohammed could take the lead for the hostages inside Gaza. Mohammed Sinwar’s name “keeps popping up,” though the official cautioned it’s still not confirmed. Yahya Sinwar’s brother was a close confidante and “has a network and the relationships inside Gaza to talk about the hostage issue.”
Mohammed Sinwar is seen as being as hardline as his brother and a key developer of Gaza’s formidable tunnel network, where hostages are believed to have been held. In September a senior Israeli official told CNN that Mohammad Sinwar had taken over as Hamas’ military commander after the killing of its pre-war chief Mohammed Deif in an Israeli air strike in July.
Mohammed Sinwar’s ascent could mean “negotiations are totally screwed,” one US official warned CNN last week after Yahya Sinwar was killed.
To lead the overall organization, top Hamas negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, who is based in Doha, is getting backing from pro-Iran, pro-Gaza corners, the regional official said. But other external elements of Hamas could push for someone else.
Yahya Sinwar was named overall leader after the previous chief negotiator, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an assassination in Tehran, believed to have been carried out by Israel. That meant that Israel was killing and hunting the very Hamas figures involved in the halting ceasefire talks.
Pressure on Hamas to re-engage
Meanwhile, Hamas is being pressured by Qatar and Egypt to re-engage on ceasefire negotiations, but the mediators have been told “point blank” that Hamas is not considering any changes to the three-phase plan that was announced by the Biden administration in late May and then approved by the UN Security Council.
Blinken is expected to meet with top Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, on Tuesday, amid tempered expectations he will return to Washington having made any significant progress on the hostage talks.
Instead, when he touches down in Tel Aviv, US officials believe that the most pivotal place for him to make progress is on the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, according to a senior US official. Last week, the Biden administration sent a letter to the Israeli government demanding it act to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy.
Historically, the Israelis have shown a higher likelihood of making progress on humanitarian issues after pressure from Biden and after in-person discussions, the official said, and they are hoping that is the case during this week’s trip.
Despite the long odds, some US officials remain hopeful that driving an end to the Gaza conflict is possible, particularly given Netanyahu’s desire for a deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, the official said. US officials are adamant that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would not agree to such a deal without an end to the war and a path toward a Palestinian state.
But in a sign of shifting global allegiances, many leaders from the region will be in Russia during Blinken’s visit this week, attending a summit hosted by President Vladimir Putin of the BRICS nations — a sign that few are banking solely on the United States in a unsteady world.","['Kevin Liptak', 'Alex Marquardt', 'Jennifer Hansler', 'Kylie Atwood']",en

A 40-year-old father of four, Eliran Mizrahi deployed to Gaza after the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
The Israeli military reservist returned a different person, traumatized by what he had witnessed in the war against Hamas in the strip, his family told CNN. Six months after he was first sent to fight, he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) back at home. Before he was due to redeploy, he took his own life.
“He got out of Gaza, but Gaza did not get out of him. And he died after it, because of the post-trauma,” his mother, Jenny Mizrahi, said.
The Israeli military has said it is providing care for thousands of soldiers who are suffering from PTSD or mental illnesses caused by trauma during the war. It is unclear how many have taken their own lives, as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not provided an official figure.
One year on, Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 people, according to the health ministry in the strip, with the United Nations reporting that most of the dead are women and children.
The war, launched after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage, is already Israel’s longest since the Jewish state was established. And as it now expands to Lebanon, some soldiers say they dread being drafted into yet another conflict.
“A lot of us are very scared of getting drafted again to a war in Lebanon,” an IDF medic who served four months in Gaza told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “A lot of us don’t trust the government right now.”
Israeli authorities – with rare exceptions – have closed off Gaza to foreign journalists unless under IDF escort, making it difficult to capture the full extent of Palestinian suffering or the experiences of soldiers there. Israeli soldiers who fought in the enclave told CNN they witnessed horrors the outside world can never truly comprehend. Their accounts offer a rare glimpse into the brutality of what critics have called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “forever war,” and the intangible toll it takes on the soldiers who participate.
For many soldiers, the war in Gaza is a fight for Israel’s survival and must be won by any means. But the battle is also taking a mental toll that, due to stigma, is largely hidden from view. Interviews with Israeli soldiers, a medic, and the family of Mizrahi, the reservist who took his own life, provide a window into the psychological burden that the war is casting on Israeli society.
The mental health toll
Mizrahi deployed to Gaza on October 8 last year and was tasked with driving a D-9 bulldozer, a 62-ton armored vehicle that can withstand bullets and explosives.
He was a civilian for most of his life, working as a manager at an Israeli construction company. After witnessing the massacres committed by Hamas, he felt the need to fight, Jenny told CNN.
The reservist spent 186 days in the enclave until he sustained injuries to his knee, followed by hearing damage in February when a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) struck his vehicle, his family said. He was pulled out of Gaza for treatment, and in April was diagnosed with PTSD, receiving weekly talk therapy.
His treatment did not help.
“They didn’t know how to treat them (soldiers),” Jenny, who lives in the Israeli Ma’ale Adumim settlement, in the occupied West Bank, said. “They (soldiers) said the war was so different. They saw things that were never seen in Israel.”
When Mizrahi was on leave, he suffered from bouts of anger, sweating, insomnia and social withdrawal, his family said. He told his family that only those who were in Gaza with him could understand what he was going through.
“He always said, no one will understand what I saw,” his sister, Shir, told CNN.
Jenny wondered if her son killed someone and couldn’t handle it.
“He saw a lot of people die. Maybe he even killed someone. (But) we don’t teach our children to do things like this,” she said. “So, when he did this, something like this, maybe it was a shock for him.”
Guy Zaken, Mizrahi’s friend and co-driver of the bulldozer, provided further insight into their experience in Gaza. “We saw very, very, very difficult things,” Zaken told CNN. “Things that are difficult to accept.”
The former soldier has spoken publicly about the psychological trauma endured by Israeli troops in Gaza. In a testimony to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, in June, Zaken said that on many occasions, soldiers had to “run over terrorists, dead and alive, in the hundreds.”
“Everything squirts out,” he added.
Zaken says he can no longer eat meat, as it reminds him of the gruesome scenes he witnessed from his bulldozer in Gaza, and struggles to sleep at night, the sound of explosions ringing in his head.
“When you see a lot of meat outside, and blood… both ours and theirs (Hamas), then it really affects you when you eat,” he told CNN, referring to bodies as “meat.”
He maintains that the vast majority of those he encountered were “terrorists.”
“The civilians we saw, we stopped and brought them water to drink, and we let them eat from our food,” he recalled, adding that even in such situations, Hamas fighters would shoot at them.
“So, there is no such thing as citizens,” he said, referring to the ability of Hamas fighters to blend with civilians. “This is terrorism.”
When soldiers do encounter civilians, however, many face a moral dilemma, according to the IDF medic who spoke to CNN anonymously.
There was a “very strong collective attitude” of distrust among Israeli soldiers toward the Palestinians in Gaza, especially at the outset of the war, the medic said.
There was a notion that Gazans, including civilians, “are bad, that they support Hamas, that they help Hamas, that they were hiding ammunition,” the medic said.
In the field, however, some of these attitudes changed “when you actually see Gazan civilians in front of your eyes,” they said.
The IDF has said that it does all it can to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza, including by sending text messages, making phone calls, and dropping evacuation leaflets to warn civilians ahead of attacks.
Despite this, civilians in Gaza have been repeatedly killed in large numbers, including when sheltering in areas the military itself has designated as “safe zones.”
The mental health toll in Gaza is likely to be enormous. Relief groups and the UN have repeatedly highlighted the catastrophic mental health consequences of the war on civilians in Gaza, many of whom had already been scarred by a 17-year blockade and several wars with Israel. In an August report, the UN said the experiences of Gazans defy “traditional biomedical definitions” of PTSD, “given that there is no ‘post’ in Gaza’s context.”
After Mizrahi took his own life, videos and photos surfaced on social media of the reservist bulldozing homes and buildings in Gaza and posing in front of vandalized structures. Some of the images, which were purportedly posted on his now removed social media accounts, appeared in a documentary that he was interviewed for on Israel’s Channel 13.
His sister, Shir, said she saw a lot of comments on social media accusing Mizrahi of being “a murderer,” cursing at him and replying with unpleasant emojis.
“It was hard,” she said, adding that she tried her best to overlook it. “I know he had a good heart.”
Clearing dead people with debris
Ahron Bregman, a political scientist at King’s College London who served in the Israeli army for six years, including during the 1982 Lebanon War, said the Gaza war is unlike any other fought by Israel.
“It’s very long,” he said, and it is urban, which means soldiers fight among many people, “the vast majority of them are civilians.”
Bulldozer operators are among those who are most directly exposed to the war’s brutality, Bregman said. “What they see is dead people, and they clear them (along) with the debris,” he told CNN. “They go over them.”
For many, the transition from the battlefield back to civilian life can be overwhelming, especially after urban warfare that involves the deaths of women and children, Bregman said.
“How can you put your children to bed when, you know, you saw children killed in Gaza?”
Despite Mizrahi’s PTSD, his family said he agreed to return to Gaza when he was called up again. Two days before he was meant to re-deploy, he killed himself.
In her home, Jenny has dedicated a room to memorialize her late son, with photos from his childhood and working in construction. Among the objects his mother has kept was the cap Mizrahi was wearing when he shot himself in the head, the bullet holes clearly visible.
Mizrahi’s family started speaking out about his death after the IDF did not grant him a military burial, saying he had not been “in active reserve duty.” They later reversed their decision.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that 10 soldiers took their own lives between October 7 and May 11, according to military data obtained by the newspaper.
Asked by CNN about the number of suicides in the IDF since the war, Uzi Bechor, a psychologist and commander of the IDF’s Combat Response Unit, said the medical corps is not allowed to provide a figure, and the military sees the suicide rate as largely unchanged.
“The suicide rate in the army is more or less stable in the last five or six years,” Bechor said, noting that it has in fact been falling over the past 10 years.
Even if the number of suicides is higher, he said, the ratio so far “is quite the same from the previous year because we have more soldiers.”
“It doesn’t mean that there is a trend of more suicide,” Bechor told CNN.
He didn’t provide CNN with the number of suicides or their rate. “Every case for us is heartbreaking,” he said.
Still, more than a third of those removed from combat are found to have mental health issues. In a statement in August, the Israeli defense ministry’s rehabilitation division said that every month, more than 1,000 new wounded soldiers are removed from fighting for treatment, 35% of whom complain about their mental state, with 27% developing “a mental reaction or post-traumatic stress disorder.”
It added that by the end of the year, 14,000 wounded fighters will likely be admitted for treatment, approximately 40% of whom are expected to face mental health issues.
More than 500 people die by suicide in Israel and over 6,000 others attempt suicide every year, according to the country’s ministry of health, which notes that “there is under-reporting of approximately 23% in the numbers mentioned.”
In 2021, suicide was the leading cause of death among IDF soldiers, the Times of Israel reported, citing military data that showed at least 11 soldiers had taken their own lives that year.
Earlier this year, the ministry of health sought to “debunk rumors of rising suicide rates since October 7,” saying that the reported cases are “isolated incidents in the media and in social media.” Without providing numbers, the ministry said that there was a “decrease in suicide in Israel between October and December in comparison with the same months in recent years.”
Bregman, the Lebanon war veteran, said that PTSD and other mental health issues are now easier to talk about than in the 1970s and 1980s thanks to the diminishing stigma. Still, he said, the soldiers coming out of Gaza will “carry (their experiences) for the rest of their lives.”
The IDF medic who spoke to CNN said that there is a mental health officer designated to every unit of the army during and after deployment. The impact of the war nonetheless persists, the medic said, with soldiers as young as 18 suffering from mental trauma in Gaza. They would often cry or would appear emotionally numb, the medic added.
Normalizing the abnormal
Bechor, the IDF psychologist, said that one of the ways the military helps traumatized troops resume their lives is to try to “normalize” what they went through, partly by reminding them of the horrors committed on October 7.
“This situation is not normal for human beings,” Bechor said, adding that when soldiers come back from the battlefield with PTSD symptoms, they ask: “How do I get back home after what I saw? How do I get to engage with my kids after what I saw?”
“We try to normalize it and to help them remember their values and why did they go there (to Gaza),” he told CNN.
For the tens of thousands of Israelis who volunteered or were called up to fight, the war in Gaza was seen not only seen as an act of self-defense but as an existential battle. That notion was touted by top Israeli political and military leaders, as well as Israel’s international allies.
Netanyahu has described Hamas as “the new Nazis” and US President Joe Biden has said that the “ancient hatred of Jews” endorsed by the Nazis was “brought back to life” on October 7.
The external threats to their country unified many Israelis, putting on hold domestic political squabbling that had for months divided society. Meanwhile, the suffering of Palestinians has largely been absent from Israeli television screens, which are dominated by news about the hostages in Gaza.
After the Hamas attacks, polls showed that most Israelis supported the war in Gaza, and did not want their government to halt the fighting even while negotiating to release the kidnapped hostages. On the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attack, a survey published by the Israel Democracy Institute found that only 6% of Israelis think the war in Gaza should be stopped due to the “the great cost in human life.”
Some soldiers, however, couldn’t rationalize the horrors they had seen.
When he returned from Gaza, Mizrahi often told his family that he felt “invisible blood” coming out of him, his mother said.
Shir, his sister, blames the war for her brother’s death. “Because of the army, because of this war, my brother is not here,” she said. “Maybe he didn’t die from a bullet (in combat) or an RPG, but he died from an invisible bullet,” she added, referring to his psychological pain.",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/20/middleeast/sinwar-death-narrative-israel-hamas-intl-latam/index.html,Israel and Hamas are fighting a battle of narratives over Sinwar’s death,2024-10-20 17:40:22,"The video depicts a desperate, abandoned man trying to attack a sophisticated military drone with a wooden stick. Or perhaps it shows a defiant hero who is staring the enemy in the eye while fighting till the bitter end. It depends on who is watching.
When the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the killing of Yahya Sinwar last week, they released several photos and a video showing the Hamas leader during his last moments alive and after his death.
It was meant to be proof that the man they said was one of the main architects of the October 7 terror attack was indeed dead, and a warning to Israel’s enemies that no matter where they hide, the IDF will eventually get them.
But the decision to release the footage appears to have backfired, at least in part, as it has since been used to celebrate Sinwar for dying as a martyr and a resistance fighter.
Now, Israel is in damage control mode, releasing older photos and videos of Sinwar hiding in tunnels with stashes of money in an attempt to portray the Hamas leader as a selfish man who only ever cared for himself.
Gershon Baskin, a Middle East expert, peace activist and a former Israeli hostage negotiator who used to speak to Hamas through backchannels, said the release of the footage was misguided and likely motivated by Israeli politics.
As a negotiator for Israel, Baskin mediated the 2011 prisoner swap that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Gilad Shalit, an IDF soldier who had been held in Gaza for five years. Yahya Sinwar was among the Palestinian prisoners released in that deal.
“It is all about controlling the narrative from the side of Netanyahu – he needs this as his victory pictures,” Baskin told CNN.
The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under criticism from all sides over the way the war in Gaza is going. Domestically, it is facing huge anger over its inability to bring back the 101 hostages still held in Gaza. Internationally, it is under pressure over the mounting Palestinian death toll and horrific humanitarian situation in the strip.
“They have no idea that (by releasing the video) they are cementing the legacy of Sinwar in Palestine and the Arab world as a new kind of Saladin, a hero, a fighter to the very end,” he said, referring to the famous 12th-century Muslim warrior who defeated a much bigger Crusader army and conquered Jerusalem.
Hamas was quick to seize the narrative and declare Sinwar a martyr who fought and died for the cause, but even Palestinians who have opposed Sinwar and Hamas in the past said the photos and video show defiance and bravery.
“I think (the Israelis) were looking for an image of victory, but Sinwar gave them a different image. He was not hiding in a tunnel, as Netanyahu claimed, he was not hiding behind Palestinian civilians, taking them as human shields, as Israeli propaganda used to say. He was not hiding behind Israeli prisoners or captives, as they also claimed, he was fighting,” Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian politician and president of the Palestinian National Initiative, told CNN.
“And this image will make him look like a hero for most Palestinians and most Arabs and most people who are against Israeli occupation and against the oppression that Palestinians are subjected to,” he added.
The video also raises questions about the way Sinwar was killed. The IDF, Israel’s security services and its intelligence agency Shin Bet had been searching for Sinwar for over a year, getting help from the CIA. Yet in the end, it was only by pure chance that a group of soldiers stumbled upon Sinwar and killed him.
At first, they didn’t even know who it was they had killed – the video shows Sinwar wearing a face covering and military clothes. It was only a day later when Israeli soldiers returned to the building to examine the scene that they realized it was Sinwar.
‘Truth is in the eye of the beholder’
Gil Siegal, a legal scholar and head of the Center for Medical Law, Bioethics and Health Policy at the Ono Academic College in Israel, said the fact that the video was used by both Israel and Hamas to make a point that suited their respective goals was not a surprise.
“The truth is in the eye of the beholder. Objectively, the picture shows a person covered with dust, clearly injured, attempting to throw an object on a drone. This is the fact, the objective fact,” he said.
“Now let’s interpret this fact. One would say: ‘oh, you see this person is fighting to his last gasp.’ The second would say: ‘you see, this is the Stone Age fighting the age of startups and technology.’ And the third will say: ‘you see, even at the last moment, this person remains violent and determined to cause damage,’ and so on.”
Siegal said there were likely several reasons why the IDF released the materials publicly, including a desire to show that Sinwar was in fact dead.
“It’s a proof. For example, people said that (Hamas’ military chief) Mohammed Deif is still alive. There were days of refutation following (the death of the Hezbollah leader) Hassan Nasrallah,” he said.
To counter the portrayal of Sinwar as a brave martyr, the IDF has since released several videos and photos of him hiding in the tunnels underneath Gaza with his family, accompanied by claims about him living a comfortable life and prioritizing himself over his people. The IDF said the footage had been captured by a Hamas security camera on October 6 and October 10 last year and obtained by the IDF in recent days.
Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic spokesperson, said the IDF found huge sums of money, food and water in Sinwar’s hideouts. “He was hiding with his family in a luxurious tunnel while the children of Gaza were out in the open as a result of his crimes and brutality,” Adraee said on X.
Posting a photo of Sinwar’s wife carrying a bag, Adraee suggested the accessory was a luxury piece that cost tens of thousands of dollars. “While the people of Gaza do not have enough money for a tent or basic necessities, we see many examples of Yahya Sinwar and his wife’s special love for money,” he said.
Shira Efron, senior director of policy research at the Israel Policy Forum, said the release of photos and videos from the tunnels was likely an attempt at “course correction on the part of Israel.”
Israel’s narrative had long been that Sinwar left the people of Gaza to suffer while he was sheltering underground, surrounding himself with the hostages taken from Israel as an insurance policy, she said.
“And then, all of a sudden, what you see is this guy and not only is he not in the tunnel and not with hostages, he’s fighting heroically like the last soldier, right, wearing armor, he looks thinner and even with his arm hanging, he lost an arm and he’s still fighting. This was not Israel’s intent,” she said, adding that the videos posted subsequently by the IDF are an attempt to reinforce their preferred narrative.
It is a known fact backed by Western intelligence agencies that Hamas has built a vast network of underground tunnels in Gaza, using them to store weapons, to move around undetected and to shelter.
The IDF said repeatedly that it believed Sinwar was moving around the tunnel network accompanied by hostages and said his DNA was found in a tunnel near where the bodies of six hostages who were killed by Hamas in late August were found.
Hamas has already issued a statement rebutting the Israeli version of events, accusing the IDF of “blatant lies” and “a failed theatrical performance” in its portrayal of the last year of Sinwar’s life.
The group said Sinwar was killed while “engaging in the battlefield” after having spent the past year “moving across various combat fronts in the Gaza Strip,” adding that “Commander Sinwar and his brothers” had humiliated the Israeli army.
But Siegal said that there was likely another reason for the IDF releasing the video showing Sinwar all alone at the end.
“Those who lead a revolution, those who lead a military campaign, are usually surrounded by the people that support them, people that live for them, people that will do everything in their power to help him. And guess what? This person supposedly fighting for the Palestinian people, the people left him by himself. He was all by himself,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/20/middleeast/gaza-israel-beit-lahia-deadly-strike-intl/index.html,"At least 87 killed in Israeli strike on northern Gaza, health ministry says",2024-10-20 00:00:00,"At least 87 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit several multi-story buildings overnight Saturday on Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, the enclave’s health ministry said.
The number killed includes 27 bodies retrieved so far and 60 people under the rubble. More than 40 people had been injured, including a number of very critical cases, the ministry said.
CNN cannot confirm the figures but they match numbers provided by Kamal Adwan hospital, where victims have been taken.
Graphic footage showed the bodies of several children among the dead, many with extensive injuries. Other video showed numerous body bags at the hospital amid grieving relatives. Overnight footage showed rescue workers combing through tonnes of rubble in the search for survivors and victims. Daylight images appear to show that two or three substantial apartment buildings were flattened by the strike.
One unidentified man at the scene said Sunday morning that there were displaced people in four homes that were destroyed. “We call on the international community to end the war,” he said. “We beg you, we are civilians with no connection to anyone. We demand that you stop the war.”
Another woman, crying amid the damage, said a woman had held her legs while she was under the rubble. “We were sitting and talking to each other when suddenly a large concrete block fell on us,” she said. “What remains? They have killed all the people.”
The woman said that Israel “directed people to go to Beit Lahia and bombed them there.”
The Israeli military has issued a number of evacuation orders for northern Gaza this month where it has renewed its ground offensive.
CNN has approached the Israeli military for fresh comment on the strike. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier dismissed reports from the Hamas-run Government Information Office in Gaza that 73 people had been killed as exaggerated, saying it operates in a “precise and targeted manner.”
Kamal Adwan Hospital director Hussam Abu Safiya told CNN earlier Sunday that a “large number” of people have been killed and injured and “transferred to the hospital amid a severe shortage of medical staff and supplies,” and that many of the injured are “facing the risk of death due to the inability to treat them.”
The hospital’s director also said the area around the hospital is coming under “bombardment and direct gunfire.”
Dr. Maher Shamiya from the hospital told CNN that staff were “working under pressure, under fear, under destruction, and under injuries.”
The United Nations’ Special Coordinator for the Peace Process in the Middle East, Tor Wennesland, in a statement expressed horror at the airstrike, saying that “the nightmare in Gaza is intensifying.”
“Horrifying scenes are unfolding in the northern Strip amidst conflict, relentless Israeli strikes and an ever-worsening humanitarian crisis,” Wennesland said, adding that “civilians must be protected wherever they are.”
The airstrike comes as the Israeli military ramps up its operations again in northern Gaza, saying Hamas was regrouping in the area, and as Israel presses on with its war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The military said it targeted the Hezbollah intelligence headquarters early on Sunday.
Israel’s war on both fronts has shown no signs of abating despite the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Thursday after a year-long pursuit.
Sinwar’s death is the latest blow to the Palestinian militant group in Gaza, where the enclave’s health ministry says more than 42,000 people have been killed since October 7. But Western officials have said that the pivotal moment could be used to cement a ceasefire and bring back hostages still trapped in the besieged territory.

The death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar could pose a rare opportunity to strike a ceasefire, US officials say – with Israel having killed several other top Hamas commanders including Ismail Haniyeh, the group’s former political leader, as well as leaders of militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Hamas and Hezbollah are both part of an axis of militant groups backed by Iran.
But both sides in the Gaza conflict have indicated fighting will continue. In a recorded video message Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sinwar’s death marked “the beginning of the day after Hamas,” but “the task before us is not yet complete.”
Hamas confirmed Sinwar’s death, but a senior official, Khalil Al Hayya, said the group would not release Israeli hostages until “aggression on our people in Gaza stops,”
Here’s what you need to know.
How did it happen?
After the October 7 attacks, Israel poured resources into a fierce manhunt for Sinwar, declaring him the most-wanted man in Gaza and a “dead man walking.” At one point, an Israeli military spokesperson said their hunt would “not stop until he is captured, dead or alive.”
US officials believed the Israeli military got close a few times, at one point even obtaining a video that purportedly showed Sinwar with several family members inside a Gaza tunnel – but he continued slipping away. The Israeli military previously surrounded Sinwar’s house and carried out an intensive assault on his hometown of Khan Younis in central Gaza, but could not find him.
That year-long search finally came to an unexpected end on Wednesday in Rafah, southern Gaza. Israeli forces had been in the area during a routine military operation when they came under fire near a building, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter.
The troops returned fire with a tank, then flew a drone into the heavily damaged building, according to the Israeli military. The video, shared by the military, shows what seem to be Sinwar’s final moments: he sits alone in a chair, surrounded by dust and rubble, appearing to look directly at the camera. He holds a piece of wood in his hand, and throws it at the drone before the video ends.
It was only then, and when troops inspected the rubble, that they realized Sinwar was among the bodies, according to the Israeli military.
When Israeli forces found a body resembling Sinwar’s on Wednesday, his finger was cut off and sent for DNA testing in order to identify him, the pathologist who examined him in Israel told CNN on Friday.
“After the laboratory made the profile, we compared it with the profile that Sinwar had in the term that he was serving here as a prisoner, so then we could identify him finally by his DNA,” Chen Kugel, chief pathologist at Israel National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv said.
Sinwar spent more than two decades in Israeli prisons before he was released in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap for an Israeli soldier.
On Saturday, Israel released new video footage it says shows Sinwar underground in Hamas tunnels “just hours before the October 7 massacre.”
Talking over the images of what the IDF says are Sinwar and his children, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that the Hamas leader was hiding alone with his family all night in tunnels below Khan Younis and that the footage showed he had “prioritized himself” over the people of Gaza.
Hamas rejected Israel’s portrayal of Sinwar in his final year, accusing the IDF of “blatant lies” and “a failed theatrical performance.” The group said Sinwar was killed while “engaging in the battlefield” after having spent the past year “moving across various combat fronts in the Gaza Strip, at the forefront of our brave people’s resistance.”
Sinwar had been trying to escape to the north when he was killed, said another Israeli military spokesperson on Thursday. He was found with a gun and more than $10,000 in Israeli shekels, the spokesperson said.
Who was Sinwar?
Sinwar had long been a key player in Hamas, joining the militant group in the late 1980s and quickly rising through the ranks.
He was born in a refugee camp in Gaza, after his family was displaced from the Palestinian village of Al-Majdal – now part of the Israeli city Ashkelon – during the Arab-Israeli war.
As a student, Sinwar became an anti-occupation activist, but he was imprisoned in Israel on several life sentences after being accused of orchestrating murder. He served 23 years before being released as part of a prisoner swap in 2011.
Sinwar returned to Gaza and quickly established his name in Hamas. He founded the group’s feared international intelligence security branch, the Majd, and was known for employing brutal violence against anyone suspected of collaborating with Israel.
He was also viewed as a pragmatic political leader by some: In 2017, Hamas elected Sinwar as the political chief of the Politburo, its main decision-making body in Gaza.
Sinwar was designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State and the European Union in 2015, and was sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France in recent years.
But he rose to greater prominence after the October 7 attacks as one of Israel’s key targets. Israeli officials have called him the “face of evil” and “the butcher from Khan Younis.”
He became one of Hamas’ most senior leaders in August after Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran. Sinwar had not been seen since the October 7 attacks, likely surviving Israel’s siege of Gaza by hiding in a vast network of underground tunnels.
What was his role on October 7?
Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ October 7 attack – though experts say he was likely one of several.
The attack was the deadliest assault on Israel in its history. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people into Gaza as hostages.
Sinwar was considered a vital decision-maker and likely the outside world’s main point of contact in Gaza during the intense negotiations over the hostages’ return.
The talks involved senior figures from Israel, Hamas, the United States, Qatar and Egypt.
What comes next?
While it’s too soon to say what may happen next or how Hamas may respond, Sinwar’s killing marks the latest blow to the group – which has seen several top leaders picked off one by one during Israel’s campaign to dismantle Hamas entirely.
Only a day after Haniyeh’s assassination, Israel confirmed it had killed Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Deif during a previous strike – another one of the reported masterminds behind October 7.
With negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage release deal to pause the war stubbornly stuck for months, senior US officials had clung to the hope that Sinwar might one day be taken out – opening a pathway to a resolution. With him now gone, officials speculate this could be one of the best chances of bringing the Israel-Hamas war to an end, but are reluctant to make any predictions about what that will ultimately mean for the volatile region.
Sinwar’s remains are currently being held in a secret location in Israel, according to local media reports. His body could be used as a “bargaining chip” in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, Israeli sources told CNN.
US President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu on a call Thursday, where “both leaders agreed that there is an opportunity to advance the release of the hostages and that they would work together to achieve this objective,” the prime minister’s office said in a readout.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with Netanyahu on Saturday, and told him that Sinwar’s death was an opportunity to stop the fighting in Gaza and get the hostages out, according to a Downing Street spokesperson.
But much remains unknown – including the fate of Sinwar’s brother.
Mohammed Sinwar recently took over as Hamas’ military commander, a senior Israeli official told CNN last month. The brothers were very close, and as recently as late August were often still together, the same official told CNN.
If Mohammed survived this week, he will likely continue his brother’s hardline negotiating tactics as Israel seeks to extract its remaining hostages from the Palestinian enclave. But until a clear picture emerges, it will be hard to know the militant group’s next move.
And even with Sinwar’s death, the wider Middle East conflict rages on – particularly as Israel prepares to retaliate against Iran’s ballistic missile attack earlier this month. CNN has previously reported that move was expected to come before the US election next month.
And another front of the conflict is ramping up across the Israel-Lebanon border, with Hezbollah announcing a “new and escalating phase” in its war with Israel on Thursday.
Hezbollah, too, has suffered significant losses in recent months – from the deadly pager and walkie-talkie attacks that killed dozens and injured thousands, many of them civilians, to the assassinations of several high-ranking commanders including their chief Hassan Nasrallah last month.
Meanwhile in Gaza, Palestinians told CNN they do not believe Sinwar’s killing will end the war – though some voiced tentative hope.
“Sinwar has died, but so many of our people have been killed, and there is no excuse now for Netanyahu to continue the war,” said 22-year-old Mumen Khalili.","['Jessie Yeung', 'Nadeen Ebrahim']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/20/middleeast/israel-ties-europe-under-strain-intl-cmd/index.html,Israel’s ties with Europe strained by wars in Gaza and Lebanon,2024-10-20 05:00:48,"Israel has been on the receiving end of scathing criticism from European leaders who are trying to restrain the Jewish state from pressing on with its wars in Gaza and southern Lebanon.
From calls for a complete halt of weapons sales to Israel and considering sanctions on far-right Israeli ministers, to talks among EU members on reviewing Israel’s Association Agreement with the bloc, European leaders are trying to use their leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into negotiating ceasefires.
Adding impetus to their effort is the fact Israeli military strikes are now hitting UN peacekeeping bases in southern Lebanon, which house European troops.
“Israel’s ties with the EU are under unprecedented stress at this point in time,” Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) think tank, told CNN.
The bloc’s position is starkly different to what experts described as unwavering support for Israel from European states on October 7 last year, when Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 others hostage.
But as Israel’s retaliation against Hamas morphed into what critics call a “forever war,” killing more than 42,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza’s health ministry, European countries have sought to distance themselves from the Jewish state.
The rising European criticism comes as the United States appears either unable or unwilling to put significant pressure on Israel just weeks ahead of the presidential election in November, experts said.
“There is a lot of frustration, in western European capitals at least, with how the US has managed diplomacy over the last year,” Lovatt said, adding that some EU states felt the US should have done more to “moderate and constrain Israeli actions.”
Last weekend, the Biden administration sent a letter to the Israeli government demanding it act to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance.
In veiled criticism on Thursday, the European Union’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said that too many people could die in that time.
“The US has been saying to Israel that they have to improve humanitarian support to Gaza, but they gave one month delay,” the EU foreign policy chief told reporters ahead of a leaders’ summit, according to Reuters. “One month delay at the current pace of people being killed. It’s too many people,” Borrell said.
Lebanon war ‘tipped things over the edge’
Relations were initially strained because of Israel’s assault in Gaza, Lovatt said, “which is seen by many European governments, including those who are still supportive of Israel, as having been disproportionate and in contradiction to international law.”
Israel’s ground operation against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon may have “tipped things over the edge” for many European states, Lovatt said. European reproach of Israel reached new levels when Israeli military strikes began hitting posts of the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon. The mission, UNIFIL, has been stationed there since 1978 and is made up of 50 nationalities, including troops from Spain, Ireland, Italy and France.
Maya Sion-Tzidkiyahu, director of the Israel-Europe Relations Program at the Mitvim think tank in Jerusalem, said that “when it comes to defending their own soldiers,” European states tend to be more vocal.
The UN has said Israel’s military has fired on its peacekeepers multiple times in recent weeks, injuring more than a dozen. Israeli forces also forcibly entered a base, and stopped a critical logistical movement, the UN said.
Israel has said it has no intention of harming the UN’s peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon but accused Hezbollah of using UNIFIL personnel as human shields. Netanyahu has warned that UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon are in “harm’s way,” and called on UN Secretary-General António Guterres to get them out “immediately.”
The diplomatic spat between Israel and some European leaders burst into the open this week.
In remarks that drew a sharp response from Israel, French President Emmanuel Macron was quoted as saying in a cabinet meeting Tuesday that “Netanyahu must not forget that his country was created by a decision of the UN,” according to the Paris-based Agence France-Presse (AFP). Macron was referring to UN Resolution 181, known as the Partition Plan, which paved the way for Israel’s creation in 1948.
“Therefore, this is not the time to disregard the decisions of the UN,” Macron added, according to AFP. The French president had earlier called for the complete suspension of the sale to Israel of arms used in the war in Gaza, while stressing France has not been involved in their supply.
In a statement Tuesday, Netanyahu said that “it was not a UN decision… but the victory that was achieved in the War of Independence with the blood of our heroic fighters” that created the State of Israel, adding that many of those fighters “were Holocaust survivors, including from the Vichy regime in France.”
Netanyahu added that the UN has “in recent decades… approved hundreds of antisemitic decisions” against Israel, with the purpose of denying the Jewish state the “right to exist and its ability to defend itself.”
Israel has repeatedly accused the UN, and Guterres, of antisemitism and this week designated the UN chief as persona non grata and banned him from entering Israel. The EU’s Borrell condemned the decision, calling the accusations of antisemitism against Guterres “slanderous.”
The EU and UK consider Hamas a terrorist organization and have repeatedly condemned its actions since October 7. The EU has also sanctioned the military wing of Hezbollah.
‘We have blocked everything’
Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also condemned Israel’s actions in Lebanon, including an Israeli military strike that hit a UN peacekeeping base where around 1,100 Italian troops are stationed.
“We defend Israel’s right to live in peace and security, but we reiterate the need for this to happen in compliance with international humanitarian law,” Meloni said Tuesday.
Italy is the third largest supplier of arms to Israel, providing the Jewish state with helicopters and guns, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). However, following the start of the war in Gaza, Italy suspended all new export licenses and canceled any agreements signed after October 7, Meloni was quoted as saying Tuesday by Italian state news agency ANSA.
This policy is “much more restrictive than that applied by our partners - France, Germany and United Kingdom,” Meloni said, according to ANSA. “We have blocked everything.”
Among the harshest critics of Israel have been the Irish and Spanish leaders, who have called on the EU to review its Association Agreement with Israel, saying the Jewish state is breaching the trade deal’s human rights clause in its Gaza war. Last week, Borrell said the issue would be discussed in the Foreign Affairs Council, as there is “enough evidence” to merit the discussion.
Changing the agreement would hurt Israel, Sion-Tzidkiyahu said, especially if trade is affected. The EU is Israel’s biggest trade partner, with trade between Israel and the bloc totaling $50.7 billion (€46.8 billion) in 2022, according to EU data.
In an earlier move that protested Israel’s war in Gaza, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized Palestinian statehood in May. While no longer a member of the EU, Britain has also sought to restrain Israel’s behavior, most recently by considering sanctions on far-right Israeli ministers.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday that his government was “looking at” sanctions against Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
Meanwhile, David Cameron, who served as British foreign secretary under the previous government until July, told Sky News on Wednesday that he had planned to sanction the two ministers during his time in office, with the intention that it would show Israel that, while the UK supported the right to self-defense, “we do want you to try and obey humanitarian law.”
Both Ben Gvir and Smotrich rejected Starmer’s comments. Ben Gvir accused the UK of working to “prevent” the establishment of the Jewish state. “The British must realize that the days of the mandate are over,” Ben Gvir’s spokesperson said in a statement, referring to the British administration of Palestine between 1917 and 1947.
Last month, the UK suspended 30 of its 350 arms export licenses with Israel over risks of such weapons being used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law. The decision was rebuked by Israeli officials.
German support
Experts said the EU is not a homogenous bloc, however, and its members have voiced varying degrees of criticism of Israel.
When it comes to Israel, Germany is often the exception to European policy. Berlin is the second-largest supplier of weapons to Israel after the US, contributing some 30% of Israel’s arms as of 2023. On Wednesday, the news agency DPA reported that, in the past eight weeks, the German government had approved military equipment and munitions exports to Israel worth €31 million ($33.7 million). That is more than twice as much as during the rest of the year, DPA said.
On Thursday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his country would continue supplying weapons to Israel.
German politicians have repeatedly stated that Israel’s security is Germany’s “reason of state.” This term is a reference to Germany’s special relationship with Israel due to its Nazi past, which saw the German state systematically murder 6 million Jews in the Holocaust. This genocide profoundly shaped the country’s policymaking.
Despite the recent tensions with the wider bloc, Sion-Tzidkiyahu said the EU’s relations with Israel “are still very strong” and remain “important to Israel.” They have not caused material harm yet, she said, but risk “taking away the legitimacy under Israel’s seat.”",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/middleeast/sinwar-death-israel-netanyahu-hostage-deal-intl-latam/index.html,"After Sinwar’s killing, Israelis call on Netanyahu to seize the moment and strike a deal with Hamas",2024-10-19 23:41:13,"With the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, many Israelis are sensing a window of opportunity to bring back the hostages still held in Gaza – and they are making their voices heard.
Huge crowds of protesters gathered across several cities in Israel on Saturday, demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government make the return of the hostages their top priority — something they believe has not been the case so far.
Sinwar was a hardliner with little interest in negotiating with Israel. The US, which mediated the talks in Cairo, has repeatedly accused him of being one of the main blockers of a ceasefire deal.
His demise could pave the way to a ceasefire agreement. But getting there will depend on Netanyahu.
The prime minister has long been trying to balance the demands of his far-right coalition partners, who seem dead-set on refusing any kind of deal with Hamas, with the increasingly loud calls from Israel’s Western allies, including the US, who are pressuring him to strike an agreement and bring the war in Gaza to an end.
Now he is once again facing large-scale protests calling for him to act.
Eran Nissan, an activist who has been attending near-weekly anti-government protests for months, and was at the gathering in Tel Aviv on Saturday, told CNN he believes many Israelis want Netanyahu to negotiate.
“There’s a solid majority and a consensus in the Israeli society on this, 105 hostages have (already) been brought back in a deal,” he said, in a reference to the week-long ceasefire and hostage exchange that took place in November.
There are 101 hostages still held in Gaza, Israeli authorities say. As many as one-third of them are thought to be dead.
But Nissan said he believed Netanyahu’s government had a reason for prolonging the war.
“(A ceasefire) is not in their interest because they know that once the war is over, they will have to answer questions about how they were complicit in (the security failures that led to the) October 7 (attacks), and that there is going to be a national inquiry, and that there is going to be a demand for elections, and in any poll that you see right now, they’re going to be hit hard,” he said.
Netanyahu has not outlined any strategy on how to capitalize on Sinwar’s death, saying only that Israel will continue to fight “until the victory.”
“This is the beginning of the day after Hamas. Evil has suffered a heavy blow, but the task before us is not yet complete,” he said.
For Yoni Levy, the only victory would be the return of his daughter Naama from Gaza. She had been serving as a lookout, observing the Gaza Strip from the Nahal Oz military base, when Hamas stormed the area and kidnapped her.
Images of her being loaded onto a truck, barefoot and badly beaten, her gray sweatpants soaked in blood, became symbols of the brutality of the October 7 attack.
Yoni Levy said the death of Sinwar had given the government an opportunity to act.
“We killed this horrible guy, but we should not move our focus,” he told CNN.
“This is the time for the prime minister to take the deal, even if we need to stop the war for some time, even if we have to release some of the murderous people from their side, now is the time to take the extra steps which we did not agree to take before,” he said.
Levy spoke to CNN on Saturday at Hostages Square – the plaza outside the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv where families and supporters of those held in Gaza have been meeting nearly every week since the October 7 attacks.
For Levy, this particular protest was special. Dozens of women, who had either known Naama or served in a similar military role as her, gathered at the square to call for her release. They wore the same clothes as Naama had on October 7 and used red paint on their bodies to symbolize the injuries she sustained in the attack.
The woman who came up with the idea, Amit Frid, said Naama should already “be home.”
“She should have been home the day after the attack, she should have been home yesterday, today, tomorrow,” she told CNN.
When Hamas confirmed Sinwar’s death on Friday, the group said it would not free its remaining hostages until Israel ended the war, fully withdrew from Gaza, and released Palestinian prisoners. Similarly, Netanyahu too vowed to keep fighting.
But in a hint that he is willing to talk, shortly after Sinwar’s death was announced, Netanyahu made a direct offer to anyone holding hostages in Gaza, saying that whoever lay down their arms and returned hostages to Israel would be let go alive.
Shira Efron, a security expert from the Israel Policy Forum, said the window of opportunity to act could be small, given that Hamas would get a new formal leader soon.
“Terrorists tend to be pretty fungible. You always find new ones,” she said, adding that Sinwar’s younger brother Mohammed, a hardliner who is believed to be just as ruthless as Yahya, was among the top contenders.
She said that Israel needed to figure out quickly who to talk to – and provide avenues for those who wanted to reach out.
“Let’s just say that someone is convinced that this is the time to lay down their arms and give in, or provide information about a hostage in return for amnesty or a cash award, who do they even call now?,” she asked.
Some of the hostages may not even be held by Hamas, having been taken by other groups and individuals and it is these people that Israel is trying to appeal to now.
Over the weekend, the Israeli military began dropping leaflets featuring a photo of Sinwar’s lifeless body in Gaza promising free passage to anyone who helped to return the hostages.
Next to it, a call out: “Sinwar destroyed your lives … Hamas will not govern Gaza anymore. Finally, the opportunity has come for you to be liberated from its tyranny. Whoever lays down their weapon and returns the abductees to us, we will allow them to leave and live in peace.”",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html,"Leaked documents show US intelligence on Israel’s plans to attack Iran, sources say",2024-10-19 20:13:01,"The US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran, according to three people familiar with the matter. One of the people familiar confirmed the documents’ authenticity.
The leak is “deeply concerning,” a US official told CNN.
The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.”
They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.
They describe preparations Israel appears to be making for a strike against Iran. One of the documents, which says it was compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, says the plans involve Israel moving munitions around.
Another document says it is sourced to the National Security Agency and outlines Israeli air force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles, also believed to be in preparation for a strike on Iran. CNN is not quoting directly from or showing the documents.
A US official said the investigation is examining who had access to the alleged Pentagon document. Any such leak would automatically trigger an investigation by the FBI alongside the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies. The FBI declined to comment.
The leak comes at an extremely sensitive moment in US-Israeli relations and is bound to anger the Israelis, who have been preparing to strike Iran in response to Iran’s missile barrage on October 1. One of the documents also suggests something that Israel has always declined to confirm publicly: that the country has nuclear weapons. The document says the US has not seen any indications that Israel plans to use a nuclear weapon against Iran.
“If it is true that Israeli tactical plans to respond to Iran’s attack on October 1 have been leaked, it is a serious breach,” said Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and a retired CIA officer.
Mulroy added that “the future coordination between the US and Israel could be challenged as well. Trust is a key component in the relationship, and depending on how this was leaked that trust could be eroded.”
The National Security Council referred CNN to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon for comment. The Pentagon and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the National Security Agency for comment.
Another US official said that “these two documents are bad, but not horrible. The concern is if there are more.”
It is not clear how the documents became public, nor whether they were hacked or deliberately leaked. The US is already on high alert about Iranian hacking campaigns — US intelligence agencies said in August that Iran had hacked documents belonging to Donald Trump’s campaign.
Axios first reported on the leaked documents Saturday.
A major leak of US intelligence last year also strained the US’ relationships with allies and partners, including South Korea and Ukraine, after a 21-year-old Air National Guardsman posted highly classified information on the social media platform Discord.

Women and young men walk on a muddied pathway as children run between rows of improvised tents in Deir al-Balah displacement camp, central Gaza.
Mohammed and others staying in makeshift displacement camps have survived Israeli bombardments that have laid waste to Gaza’s streets for over a year, enduring catastrophic violence, constant killings and disfigurement, and crippling hunger.
As Israel celebrated its killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar this week – with its allies hoping Sinwar’s death will now open a possibility for peace in Gaza – Mohammed and many others remain skeptical it will change their daily reality.
“I do not believe that the war will end with his killing,” Mohammed told CNN, adding that he was “saddened” to hear the news of the death of Sinwar. Israel’s most wanted man, believed to be one of the architects of the group’s October 7, 2023 attack, was killed by the Israeli military in Rafah, southern Gaza, on Wednesday.
Sinwar was a divisive figure to Palestinians: a militant hardliner, Sinwar was seen as a brutal force by some, a pragmatic political thinker by others, and a freedom fighter to many.
Born in a refugee camp in 1962, his family displaced from the Palestinian village of Al-Majdal – in what is now the Israeli city of Ashkelon – Sinwar was “a symbol of the Palestinian people,” in Mohammed’s view and that of many others.
Many Gazans today are afraid to publicly voice support for Sinwar and Hamas for fear of being targeted by the Israeli military — which launched its siege of Gaza with the stated aim of destroying Hamas after it led the October 7 terror attacks, and to save the hostages taken that day. Others fear condemning Hamas, which controls the Palestinian enclave.
But Samah, 36, told CNN that she saw Sinwar’s acts as crimes, for which Gaza had borne the human cost.
“Sinwar was a target for Israel and he was targeted and killed. He attacked Israel, and committed crimes that we have paid the price for … We paid with horrific tragedies, with the blood of our children, our money, and our homes.”
She too said she had little hope that his death would be a turning point in the war. “The assassination of leaders seems to change nothing. (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu wants more and more people to be killed. We wish to live in security, peace, and stability,” she said.
Sinwar’s last moments
Sinwar’s death has prompted speculation among Western allies over whether the coming weeks could signal the beginning of the end of fighting in Gaza, and the release of 101 remaining Israeli hostages.
But Netanyahu has given no signal he is ready to end the war. And Hamas has vowed to continue fighting.
Akram Dabbour, another displaced man in Deir al-Balah, told CNN he did not expect change. He received the news of Sinwar’s death with “deep sadness and pain because (Sinwar) is a noble resister” – and predicted he would soon be replaced. “Israel has become accustomed to killing. I do not believe that the war will end after his death, because a leader gives birth to leaders,” Dabbour added.
On Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces released drone footage that it said shows Sinwar in his final moments. The edited video shows the interior of a hollowed-out building, where a man that the IDF identifies as Sinwar can be seen perched alone on an armchair.
In the footage, the figure’s face is obscured by a scarf and covered in a thick layer of dust. His right arm appears to be injured, as he turns toward the drone. He is holding what the IDF described as a piece of wood, before throwing it toward the lens.
The footage appeared to show Sinwar at his weakest – alone and nearing defeat. But that’s not how most Palestinians see it, according to Mustafa Barghouti, a physician and an independent Palestinian politician.
“He was not hiding behind Palestinian civilians, taking them as human shields, as Israeli propaganda used to say… He was not hiding behind Israeli prisoners or captives, as they also claimed,” Barghouti told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.
“This image will make him look like a hero for most Palestinians,” Barghouti added, explaining that Sinwar’s apparent defiance in his final moments would be perceived by Palestinians as part of a broader historical resistance, even among those who did not agree with the Hamas leader’s tactics.
Like Sinwar, at least 70% of residents in Gaza are refugees, or descendants of those uprooted by al-Nakba, or “the catastrophe,” according to Amnesty International, when about 700,000 Palestinians were forcibly expelled from their homes during the creation of Israel in 1948.
Decades later, those same descendants are grappling with the same reality of being unable to return to their homes in Gaza, with an estimated 69% of buildings in the enclave now destroyed or partly damaged, according to the CUNY Institute.
For Abu Fares, one of hundreds of thousands prevented from returning to their homes, Sinwar’s death is just a continuation of a brutal war. “It will not stop the battle or the fighting, because the children who carried their father’s dismembered body and those who carried their sister’s dismembered body — what do you expect from them after 20 years?”
‘I wish for my own death’
Sinwar’s killing comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza spirals and the death toll from Israeli airstrikes continues to rise.
At least 42,500 people have been killed since October 8, 2023, with another 99,546 injured, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. At least 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.2 million people have been displaced, according to the UN.
Entire families have been erased, with many neighborhoods reduced to wastelands of thick sewage pools. More than a million people in northern Gaza are facing a looming famine compounded by Israel’s aid restrictions, the UN warned earlier this year.
Suha Al Turk, a young woman displaced in Deir al-Balah told CNN: “Israel claims that he (Sinwar) is one of their targets and that after his assassination, the war will stop. But the war will not stop… They are exterminating civilians – we are the ones living through the massacres every day.”
Around 70% of Palestinians killed by Israel’s strikes are women and children, according to the Hamas-run Government Media Office (GMO). More than 17,000 children have been killed in the Israeli attacks since October 8, the office said.
Israel has said that its sustained military campaign in Gaza is designed to root out what remains of Hamas, following the Hamas-led attacks that killed 1,200 people in Israel and saw more than 250 people abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel says it takes steps to minimize civilian harm, like making phone calls and sending text messages to residents in buildings designated for attack. For years, it has also said Hamas fighters use mosques, hospitals and other civilian buildings to hide from Israeli attacks and launch their own – claims that Hamas has repeatedly denied.
But human rights agencies and many world leaders, including Israel’s allies, have repeatedly raised concerns over Israel’s war conduct and the civilian toll. Groups like Amnesty International also say warnings do not absolve Israel of responsibilities under international humanitarian law to limit civilian harm.
Mahmoud Jneid, also displaced in Deir al-Balah, said the world’s focus should rest on civilian suffering – not Sinwar’s death. “Sinwar was a target. What about us, the displaced? The closure of crossings and the lack of food and drink for children make our situation worse than (his) assassination,” he said.
“I wish Israel would assassinate me too,” Jneid said. “My brothers and family have died, and I wish for my own death so that I can find peace.”","['Abeer Salman', 'Mohammad Al Sawalhi', 'Sana Noor Haq']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/world/what-next-for-hamas-intl/index.html,Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is dead. Here’s who could head the group next,2024-10-18 14:22:57,"Israel succeeded Wednesday in its year-long mission to kill Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the man accused of being one of the masterminds of the October 7, 2023 attacks.
But while Sinwar’s death is a huge blow for Hamas, it does not signal the immediate demise of the group. Hamas has vowed to continue fighting, saying that the killing of leaders – including Sinwar – does not mean the end of their movement.
A Friday statement from Hamas’ political office confirming Sinwar’s death said: “Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.”
As rumors swirl about Sinwar’s successor, here’s what we know about what’s next for Hamas:
It is unclear whether Sinwar himself left any instructions on who should replace him, but his younger brother Mohammed Sinwar is seen by many as his heir apparent. Like his brother, Mohammed is a hardline militant who recently became Hamas’ military commander.
Mohammed Sinwar’s fate is currently unknown. Israeli media reported Friday that an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said that they are “actively searching” for him. A senior Israeli official previously told CNN the two brothers spent much of the past year side by side and were together as recently as August.
Mousa Abu Marzouk, the deputy chief of Hamas’ political bureau who helped found Hamas, could also be a contender to become Sinwar’s replacement. He spent five years living in the United States before the FBI designated him as a terrorist. He was eventually deported.
Khaled Meshaal, the group’s former political chief, is also seen as a powerful contender for the role. Meshaal is well known internationally, having met with top officials including former United States President Jimmy Carter, Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the past.
However, he might face difficulty over his past support for a Sunni uprising against Syrian President Bashar al Assad as Hamas, itself a Sunni group, is supported by Shia-majority Iran.
Sinwar’s deputy Khalil Al Hayya is seen as another powerful contender for the role. He acted as the chief negotiator for Hamas during recent ceasefire talks in Cairo and is based in Qatar.
Both Meshaal and Al Hayya have been among Hamas’ top-ranking officials for many years. And both have been the targets of Israeli assassination attempts in the past. In 1997, Israeli Mossad agents posing as Canadian tourists sprayed a poisonous substance into Meshaal’s ear. The incident was widely publicized as the Israeli intelligence service agents were captured in Jordan.
Israel has killed Hamas’ previous leaders: In 2004 they killed Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. A few weeks later, his successor Abdel Aziz Rantisi was killed.
While Hamas has always managed to recover from multiple assassinations on its leadership, it is hard to say how they will now regroup, given how Hamas’ organizational structure changed under Sinwar’s rule.
Sinwar had consolidated power during the war, becoming Hamas’ sole decision maker in Gaza following the killing of the other two top Hamas officials there.
Mohammed al-Masri – popularly known as Mohammed Deif – was the commander of Hamas’ military arm, the Al-Qassam Brigades, and was killed in an Israeli airstrike in July. Deif’s deputy Marwan Issa was killed in March, according to the Israeli military. Hamas never acknowledged their deaths.
Sinwar became Hamas’ most senior leader after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran in July. Iran blamed the killing on Israel. The Israel Defense Forces did not comment on the accusation.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/middleeast/sinwar-death-war-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,Sinwar’s killing brings end of Gaza war within reach - if Israel can seize the chance,2024-10-17 00:00:00,"The man dubbed by Israel a “dead man walking” is dead.
Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing in Gaza is a major win for Israel following a year-long manhunt for the man believed to be the mastermind of the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history.
And it could bring the devastating war in Gaza closer to an end, experts say – if Israel and its allies can seize the opportunity.
Harel Chorev, senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University, told CNN that Sinwar’s death could be a fatal blow for Hamas because of the way he ran the group.
Before the war, power in Hamas was decentralized – with Gaza political chief Sinwar just one of many leaders, Chorev said.
But that changed over the past year.
“Sinwar became the sole decision maker, and of course, he grew stronger and stronger as Israel killed more and more important figures, such as (Hamas’ military chief) Mohammed Deif,” he said.
A year of pounding by Israel, which has left swathes of Gaza flattened and killed more than 42,000 people, has left Hamas greatly weakened. Sinwar’s killing will create a major power vacuum – which Israel and its allies will no doubt aim to capitalize on.
It is unclear whether Sinwar left any instructions on what should happen in the event of his death.
Several names have been floated as possible successors, including Sinwar’s brother Mohammed, who is seen as another hardliner, and Khalil Al Hayya, chief negotiator for Hamas during ceasefire talks in Cairo. Neither has Sinwar’s public profile in Gaza.
“Israel needs to take advantage of this situation and the major confusion that is probably spreading among the ranks of Hamas,” Chorev said.
Netanyahu’s ‘political calculations’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted his goal is to eliminate Hamas completely, even though many experts have warned this may not be achievable.
Hamas might be greatly weakened, but it is still capable of firing rockets toward Israel. Meanwhile, the Israeli military recently re-entered northern Gaza, saying Hamas was reemerging in the area.
Shira Efron, a senior director of policy research at the Diane and Guilford Glazer Foundation said Sinwar’s killing gives Netanyahu the chance to claim a victory.
“They can now say ‘OK, we have won the war, we can wind down the war in Gaza and move towards a different reality on the ground,” she said.
But Netanyahu could instead frame Sinwar’s demise as the signal to intensify the conflict, she added.
“This all has to do with the political calculations of Netanyahu and his coalition,” she said.
Netanyahu has not yet outlined his government’s next steps. And while he did call Sinwar’s killing the “beginning of the day after Hamas,” he said that the war is not over.
“Today evil has suffered a heavy blow, but the task before us is not yet complete,” he said.
Sinwar’s killing could also pave the way for a hostage and ceasefire agreement, since he was believed to be one of the main blockers of a deal.
Sinwar had little personal incentive to negotiate, given that he was Israel’s No. 1 target, Chorev said.
Some hostage families are urging Netanyahu to push for a deal.
“If Netanyahu does not take advantage of the momentum and does not stand up now and present a new Israeli initiative, even at the cost of ending the war, it means that he has decided to abandon my Matan and the other hostages, with the aim of prolonging the war and fortifying his rule,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is still in Gaza.
Uzi Rabi, also from Tel Aviv University, said the hostages should now be the top priority.
“Israel must do its utmost to get them back,” he said. “Without Sinwar, it might be little bit easier.”
Speaking shortly after the announcement of Sinwar’s death on Thursday, Netanyahu appealed to the remaining Hamas fighters in Gaza.
“I call on everyone who holds hostages, whoever lays down their weapons and returns them, we will allow them to leave and live,” he said.
What happens next?
What happens next will largely depend on Netanyahu.
The long-time prime minister has been trying to juggle the demands of his far-right coalition partners with pressures from the United States and Israel’s other allies to strike a ceasefire deal and minimize the devastating cost of the war on civilians in Gaza.
At the same time, he is facing several criminal investigations and large-scale protests calling for his resignation at home.
In addition, many of Israel’s allies have criticized Netanyahu’s handling of the war, with US President Joe Biden having long voiced concerns that he may be dragging out the war in Gaza in an attempt to cling to power, something the Israeli leader has denied.
While still hugely unpopular among a large portion of Israeli society, Netanyahu has staged a remarkable turnaround over the past year, clawing back some of the support he had lost over the years.
Netanyahu has in the past insisted on Israel maintaining some military presence in Gaza after the immediate conflict is over. And some of his coalition partners have gone as far as suggesting Israel should build Jewish settlements inside Gaza.
Rabi said he believed some level of Israeli military presence would be needed to prevent Hamas from rebuilding itself in the strip – something Israel’s allies have warned the government against.
“You have to take control of the civilian infrastructure in order to empty Hamas of its authority and its legitimacy in the eyes of the Gazans,” he said.
“We should (work) with the Emiratis, with the Saudis, with the Americans and with Palestinians – other than Hamas, as to how to proceed from here,” he said. “Maybe this would be actually the opening shot for a different future for Palestinians and the Middle East.”
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has previously criticized Netanyahu’s plan to keep Israeli military rule in Gaza, warning it would come with a heavy price.
Efron, the analyst, said Netanyahu has already gotten a boost from Israel’s successful operation targeting the leadership of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based militant group.
The killing of Sinwar will give him another lift – and a sense of vindication, she said.
“He can now claim that everyone in the world told him not to go into Rafah and Sinwar was killed in Rafah,” she said, referring to pressure Netanyahu faced from Israel’s allies before the military launched its invasion into Gaza’s southernmost city as some 1.2 million people sheltered there.
“It doesn’t mean that he was in Rafah when the operation there started, but I think it lets Netanyahu justify his decisions in hindsight,” Efron said.
Chorev, from Tel Aviv University, added that Netanyahu could see Sinwar’s killing as a moment to cement his legacy.
Many Israelis blamed Netanyahu for the October 7 attack. It was also Netanyahu that agreed to release Sinwar from an Israeli jail in a 2011 prisoner swap – a decision that came to haunt him.
“He didn’t want to be remembered as the one who just brought about October 7, but also the one who won the war of October 7. I think for him, this might be a major achievement,” Chorev said. “And if he’s wise, he will leave the office afterwards.”
But while Sinwar’s killing may have brought Hamas to perhaps its weakest moment, destroying the militant group will not by itself guarantee a peaceful future. Israel has killed several Hamas leaders in the past and the group has always managed to recover.
Senior Hamas official Basem Naim alluded to the group’s determination to keep fighting, saying on Thursday that while Sinwar’s death was “painful and distressing,” the group would be “eventually victorious.”
Meanwhile, Israel’s intense bombardment and deadly ground operation has turned most of Gaza into a wasteland. Thousands of children have been orphaned, maimed and traumatized.
Israel now needs to ensure they can have a better future – otherwise it risks creating another generation susceptible to radicalization.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

The Biden administration’s move to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Lebanon in light of the ongoing Hezbollah-Israel military conflict comes after Lebanese Americans urged both the administration and Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign to take this action.
White House officials have met with Lebanese Americans at least twice over the course of recent weeks, and there have been multiple virtual meetings and phone calls between Lebanese Americans and officials on VP Harris’ team where this issue has been raised, two Lebanese Americans familiar with the exchanges told CNN. Some of those engagements happened as recently as earlier this week.
On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the designation for Lebanon for 18 months “due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in Lebanon that prevent nationals of Lebanon from returning in safety.” The protections apply for certain Lebanese nationals already in the United States.
“Those approved for TPS will be able to remain in the country while the United States is in discussions to achieve a diplomatic resolution for lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,” the department’s announcement reads.
In Michigan – where the Arab American community is a critical voting bloc – this move could boost Harris’ support, the Lebanese Americans familiar with the exchanges said. Still, the community is urging the administration to also implement humanitarian parole for Lebanese citizens as well.
“Today’s announcement of TPS for Lebanon is welcomed news. This is an important step in providing protection for many in our community, and I commend the administration for this decision,” Michigan state Rep. Alabas Farhat told CNN. “TPS will allow us to protect Lebanese nationals who are already in the United States. However, people in my district are still watching their loved ones die overseas. I urge this administration to also implement humanitarian parole for Lebanese citizens.”
The Biden administration has also faced pressure to make this move from lawmakers. In an October letter addressed to President Joe Biden, Sens. Gary Peters, Dick Durbin, and Ben Cardin requested that Lebanon be designated for TPS because of what they described as a worsening humanitarian emergency. They issued a similar request in June.
Earlier this year, Biden granted Lebanese nationals in the United States temporary protections from deportation. The president has discretion to authorize what’s known as deferred enforced departure, which protects those covered from removal from the US for a period of time. Those who qualify are also eligible for work permits.","['Kylie Atwood', 'Priscilla Alvarez']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/politics/sinwar-death-biden-gaza-peace-process/index.html,Biden: Sinwar’s death injects uncertainty - but also an opening - into possibly resolving Gaza conflict,2024-10-17 17:30:21,"For months, frustrated American officials looking to end the war in Gaza have mused quietly about the one scenario they believed could loosen deadlocked ceasefire talks: the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, believed to be hiding deep underneath Gaza in the group’s network of tunnels.
Whether that is what transpires over the coming days remains an open question. Without his singular operational control, the group’s constellation of commanders, believed to be holding dozens of Israeli hostages in the Hamas tunnels, could be left to their own devices and adopt a new approach.
Yet inside the White House and aboard Air Force One, where President Joe Biden first learned of Sinwar’s death, optimism abounded that a new phase had opened in the year-long conflict.
“His removal from the battlefield does present an opportunity to find a way forward that gets the hostages home, brings the war to an end and brings us to a day after,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard the presidential aircraft, which was ferrying the president to meetings in Berlin.
Speaking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the plane, Biden congratulated his counterpart on successfully taking out the terrorist his military had spent the last year hunting. But he also said, in no uncertain terms, that Sinwar’s death should augur an end to the war.
“I told him that we were pleased with his actions, and further that, now is the time to move on,” Biden told reporters in Berlin after he landed. “Move on, move toward a ceasefire in Gaza, make sure we’re moving in a direction that we’re going to be in a position to make things better for the whole world.”
How to strike a hostage and ceasefire deal, and with whom, was still a matter of uncertainty for American officials, who spent the hours after Sinwar’s death trying to determine if he had a successor. Biden said he was dispatching Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the region in the coming days.
Blinken said in August that “the fate of the deal” — speaking to the ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas — was in Sinwar’s hands. But US officials stopped short of saying Thursday that his death will result in a deal overnight.
“We don’t know what this means yet,” said one US official, adding there could be “rapid” movement towards a ceasefire and hostage deal or “there could still be a long path ahead.”
“It would help a lot to make that realistic,” a second senior US official said, referring to Sinwar’s death.
For all the unknowns, the moment was viewed inside the White House and across the Biden administration as a momentous one.
“There is now the opportunity for a ‘day after’ in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike,” Biden said in a statement drafted aboard Air Force One and sent several hours after Sinwar’s death was confirmed. “Yahya Sinwar was an insurmountable obstacle to achieving all of those goals. That obstacle no longer exists. But much work remains before us.”
Sinwar’s killing is, perhaps more than anything else, the singular event many US officials have pointed to as the biggest potential game-changer in the Israel-Hamas war. Coming weeks ahead of the American presidential election, the death has the potential to transform a conflict that long ago became a drag on President Joe Biden’s political fortunes, and by extension Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign.
Even with Sinwar’s death, there is virtually no expectation the wider Middle East conflict will be resolved before Election Day, particularly as Israel prepares to retaliate against Iran’s ballistic missile attack earlier this month. For many voters, negative views of the conflict have hardened after a year of fighting. Yet any development that could allow for a lowering of the regional temperatures would be welcome, both inside the White House and at Harris’ campaign headquarters.
“This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,” Harris said during a campaign stop in Milwaukee.
With progress towards a ceasefire-for-hostages deal to pause the war stubbornly stuck for months, senior administration officials had hung onto hope that Sinwar might one day be taken out – opening doors in the talks that simply would not be available otherwise.
“It all comes down to Sinwar,” is how one senior administration official had bluntly put it earlier this year as ceasefire talks had stalled.
Netanyahu vowed to go after Sinwar
To be sure, Netanyahu had put up his own series of roadblocks to a hostage deal, generating immense frustrations inside the White House. But the Israeli leader had stated publicly his intentions go after Sinwar until his death. Simply put, US officials have looked at Sinwar as the scalp that Israel needed most to be able to declare they are done with the Hamas war.
“Sinwar’s death would provide a renewed opening for President Biden to again push for the first phase of the ceasefire deal to be implemented and it would increase pressure on Netanyahu to do so,” said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region. “For months, Israel has highlighted that Sinwar is the sticking point, that he doesn’t want a deal, and keeps changing prisoner demands in exchange for hostages. But at the same time, there has been significant chatter that much of Hamas is exhausted and would welcome a respite.”
“Whether a deal could be struck for a cessation of hostilities will depend on the new leader, but at minimum it provides space and an opportunity that hasn’t existed for a few a few months now,” Panikoff said.
The ongoing military conflict between Hezbollah and Israel complicates any potential opportunity for bringing the sprawling conflict to an end, one US official said. The US has been sharing intelligence with Israel regularly to try and identify Sinwar’s whereabouts, but it’s not clear any of that intelligence contributed to this specific operation.
“The IDF is more surprised by this than we are,” the official said, noting that Israelis have told them that this was not an operation that they had been carrying out specifically to target Sinwar.
Increasingly over the past several months, American assessments found Sinwar to be dug in, fatalistic about his chances of survival and determined to continue bogging down Israel in a military conflict that has damaged its international reputation.
That mindset had only hardened as the Gaza war reached its one-year mark earlier this month, leaving American officials doubtful Sinwar would ever agree to a hostage and ceasefire deal.
With his death, the path forward isn’t immediately clear.
“This is a big rock dropped in a lake and the ripples are quite extraordinary,” said Aaron David Miller, a seasoned Middle East negotiator who worked for multiple American administrations, adding: “Will this provide the kind of political explanation and justification for Benjamin Netanyahu to seriously consider to cooperate in a way to try to deescalate and ultimately end the war in Gaza? These questions are unanswerable right now, but the ripples are quite clear.”
Questions about who will replace Sinwar
Among the questions American officials are now searching for answers is who will make military decisions for Hamas. Sinwar had issued orders for his commanders to kill their hostages if under siege by Israeli forces, a dictate that it wasn’t clear would be extended.
“If in fact you are now talking about a negotiation, if there is a Palestinian negotiator on the Hamas side who now understands that negotiations are the only way out of this, if the organization is going to survive in some form, you may have an opening. But you have inertia and you have the need to continue to look for hostages,” said Miller. “I don’t think the Israeli government position is immediately going to default into ‘Let’s stop shooting and now let’s start talking.’”
Sinwar had long lived a deeply isolated existence, often making it difficult for Qatari and Egyptian mediators to reach him as they worked to broker a ceasefire deal.
US officials believed he no longer used electric communication devices and relied on human sources to convey and receive information. For long stretches, American officials couldn’t even say definitively whether he was alive or dead.
“By all accounts, Sinwar has been the biggest obstacle within Hamas to a ceasefire-hostage release deal in Gaza. Depending on who would take his place, Sinwar’s death could revive hope for an agreement to end the war. Of course, that assumes Netanyahu is prepared to make a deal while his coalition openly talks about reestablishing Israeli settlements in the territory,” said Andrew Miller, a former senior State Department official working on Middle East issues.
Biden, in conversations with his Israeli counterpart, had tried to encourage an end to the war in Gaza that didn’t preclude operations to find and kill Sinwar.
“There’s a lot of things that, in retrospect, I wish I had been able to convince the Israelis to do,” Biden said at a news conference in July. “But the bottom line is we have a chance now. It’s time to end this war. It doesn’t mean walk away from going after Sinwar and Hamas.”
Yet while operations in Gaza slowed as Israeli turned its focus to its northern front with Hezbollah in Lebanon, its deadly onslaught of airstrikes continued, causing the civilian death toll to rise. As the US election nears, the administration has begun applying new pressure on Israel to improve humanitarian conditions inside Gaza, which have worsened significantly over the past weeks.
In a stern letter revealed this week, Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel that a failure to deliver more aid to the enclave could trigger a cutoff of military assistance.
How the conflict unfolds in the three weeks before Election Day remains one of the biggest uncertainties for the two presidential campaigns. While not a top-tier issue for many voters, the crisis has complicated Harris’s efforts to win Michigan, a state with a major concentration of Arab American voters. She is campaigning in the state three days this week.","['Kevin Liptak', 'MJ Lee', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Alex Marquardt']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-hamas-leader-killed-intl/index.html,Who was Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar?,2024-10-17 19:42:44,"Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, believed to be one of the architects of the militant group’s October 7, 2023, terror attack and Israel’s most wanted man, was killed in Gaza on Wednesday, according to the Israeli military.
Sinwar was one of the key targets of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, and Israeli officials branded him with many names, including the “face of evil” and “the butcher from Khan Younis.” Formerly a very public figure, Sinwar had not been seen since the October 2023 attacks, likely surviving the last year of Israel’s siege of Gaza by bunkering down in a vast network of underground tunnels.
In August, Sinwar became one of Hamas’ most senior leaders after his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran.
But he had long been a key player in the militant group. Sinwar joined Hamas in the late 1980s, rising quickly through its ranks. He founded Hamas’ feared international intelligence security branch, the Majd, and was known for employing brutal violence against anyone suspected of collaborating with the Israelis. He was also viewed as a pragmatic political leader by some: In 2017, Hamas elected Sinwar as the political chief of its main decision-making body, the Politburo, in Gaza.
Sinwar was born in a refugee camp in 1962 in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. His family was displaced from the Palestinian village of Al-Majdal – now the Israeli city Ashkelon – during the Arab-Israeli war.
Sinwar enrolled in the Islamic University in Gaza in the early 1980s, where he studied Arabic, was involved in Palestinian nationalist student organizations and was detained for his participation in anti-occupation activism. In 1985, before Hamas was formed, he helped organize the Majd, a network of Islamist youths that exposed Palestinian informants working with Israel. Later, that group would be folded into Hamas’ security apparatus of the same name.
Sinwar was imprisoned in Israel on four life sentences in 1988, accused of orchestrating the murder of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.
During his incarceration, Sinwar was said to have abused and manipulated fellow prisoners, punishing those thought to be informants and bullying others to undertake hunger strikes.
Sinwar said he spent his years in prison studying his enemy, including learning how to read and speak Hebrew through the Open University.
In 2011, he was released as part of a prisoner swap that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Gilad Shalit, an IDF soldier who had been held in Gaza for five years.
At that time, Sinwar called the exchange “one of the big strategic monuments in the history of our cause.” Sinwar’s release has been attributed to the fact that his brother was one of Shalit’s kidnappers, who insisted on Sinwar being included in the deal.
After being freed, he returned to Gaza where he began his rise in the militant organization, becoming notorious for the violent treatment he would dole out on suspected collaborators.
While some viewed Sinwar as a hardline militant, others saw him as a master strategist.
Fifteen years into his prison sentence, he used his Hebrew skills to urge the Israeli public to support a truce with Hamas in an interview with an Israeli broadcaster. “We will not recognize Israel, but we are ready to do a long-term truce with Israel that will bring calm and prosperity to the region,” he said.
And in a rare interview with an Italian journalist in 2018, Sinwar indicated that the group was willing to find a political solution, saying: “A new war is in no one’s interest.”
He also alluded to the reality he and others in Gaza were facing under Israel’s blockade, drawing from his own experience in Israeli jail. “I never came out – I have only changed prisons,” he said of life in Gaza.
In 2018, under Sinwar’s leadership, Hamas launched its “March of Return” campaign, which saw Gazans protest weekly near the Israeli border, calling for Israel to lift their blockade and to allow Palestinians the right to return to their ancestral villages and towns. The demonstrations drew international attention and support of human rights groups. At one of the protests, Sinwar applauded those facing “the enemy who besieges us.”
As the group’s political leader, Sinwar focused on the group’s foreign relationships, forging important ties with regional Arab powers.
He was responsible for restoring Hamas’ relationship with Egyptian leaders who were wary of the group’s support for political Islam, and for pulling in continued military funding from Iran, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).
Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on October 7 – though experts say he is likely one of several – making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza.
The attack was the deadliest assault in Israel’s history. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and also took some 250 people hostage into Gaza.
Sinwar was considered a vital decisionmaker and likely the main point of contact within Gaza during the intense negotiations over the return of the hostages taken into the enclave by Hamas in the October 7 attacks. The talks involved senior figures from Israel, Hamas, the United States, Qatar and Egypt.
Throughout the war, Sinwar consolidated the leadership of Hamas and became by far its most important figure. His influence grew even more following the killing of other senior Hamas officials, including Mohammed al-Masri, popularly known as Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of Hamas, and Deif’s deputy, Marwan Issa.
In 2015, Sinwar was designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State and the European Union. In recent years, he has been sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.","['Kara Fox', 'Ivana Kottasová']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html,"Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza, Israeli military says",2024-10-17 17:36:22,"The Israeli military confirmed on Thursday that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, believed by Israel to be chief architect of the militant group’s deadly October 7, 2023, terror attack that set off the war in Gaza, had been killed in battle.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Sinwar was killed on Wednesday after a “year-long pursuit.”
“In recent weeks, IDF and ISA forces, under the command of the Southern Command, have been operating in the southern Gaza Strip, following IDF and ISA intelligence that indicated the suspected locations of senior members of Hamas,” the Israeli military statement read.
“IDF soldiers of the 828th Brigade (Bislach) operating in the area identified and eliminated three terrorists. After completing the process of identifying the body, it can be confirmed that Yahya Sinwar was eliminated.”
Two Israeli sources familiar with the matter told CNN earlier that Israeli forces encountered Sinwar during a routine military operation.
The sources said that Israeli infantry troops encountered three militants near a building in Gaza and engaged them. After the battle ended, troops found a body resembling Sinwar and alerted senior commanders.
Israel had also confirmed to US officials that Sinwar was dead according to initial DNA testing, another person familiar with the matter said.
Dental records helped Israel identify Sinwar, a US official and former official familiar with the matter said, in addition to other biometrics. The dental confirmation was able to be conducted relatively quickly, the official said. The Israeli government has Sinwar’s biometrics because he spent more than two decades in Israeli imprisonment for murder.
According to Israeli Army Radio, which is state funded and operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the Israeli military detected “suspicious movement” on the upper floor of a building, so fired at it with a tank. Later, the radio station said, a drone scanned the area of the attack, and soldiers recognized the face of Sinwar in the rubble.
The IDF had previously detected “unusual activity” in the area, the radio station reported, so decided last week to “increase scans and not to leave.”
Hamas has yet to make any comment on its leader.
Sinwar was long Israel’s most wanted man in the strip, but he remained elusive.
Sinwar was the top target of Israel’s operation in Gaza, launched in the wake of the October 7 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Israel has killed several senior Hamas figures in its air and ground campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 42,000 people and triggered a humanitarian crisis, according to authorities in the strip.
Pictures purported to show the dead body of Sinwar are circulating widely on social media. In them, a man strongly resembling Sinwar can be seen lying dead in the rubble of a destroyed building with serious injuries to the skull.
CNN has run the images through authenticator software, which shows no signs of image manipulation. It is not possible to discern a location or timeframe of his death from the still photographs. CNN has not yet been able to confirm the identity of the man seen in the photographs.
Sinwar led Hamas since August, following the assassination of previous leader Ismail Haniyeh.
He had not been seen in public since the Hamas attacks and is thought to have been hiding in the vast network of tunnels worming their way under Gaza.
Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on October 7 – though experts say he is likely one of several. Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Al-Qassam brigades who Israel claimed to have killed in a strike in July, and his deputy, Marwan Issa, have also been named as key figures behind October 7.
A longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas’ military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group’s civilian and political leader.
He was elected to Hamas’ main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza branch.
Sinwar has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015, and has been recently sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.
US officials have speculated that his death could be one of the best chances of bringing the Israel-Hamas war to an end. With a ceasefire and hostages deal to pause the war stubbornly stuck for months, senior Biden administration officials had hung onto hope that Sinwar might one day be taken out – and that that could open up doors that simply would not be otherwise.","['Jeremy Diamond', 'Pauline Lockwood', 'Sophie Tanno']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/middleeast/where-israel-get-its-weapons/index.html,Israel’s weapons: Where do they come from and who supplies them?,2024-10-16 13:21:46,"The United States has warned Israel it may stop supplying the country with weapons unless the humanitarian situation in Gaza improves.
This is not the first time Israel’s major ally has threatened to turn off supplies. In May, US President Joe Biden said he would halt some shipments of weapons to Israel if an invasion of the southern city of Rafah went ahead. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed on with the campaign – and the flow of US weapons continued.
The latest warning though, which says Israel has 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground, or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, is a significant step up in pressure, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy.
While other countries have drastically reduced their military aid to Israel over the past year, the United States has not.
Here’s a breakdown of who supplies Israel with weapons:
The United States:
The United States is overwhelmingly the biggest supplier of arms to Israel. In 2023 69% of Israel’s arm imports came from the US, according to a report into international arms transfers by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Germany was the second largest, providing 30%, followed by Italy with 0.9%. The UK, France and Spain were among other minor contributors.
The US-imported weapons “have played a major role in Israel’s military actions against Hamas and Hezbollah,” the think tank reported, noting that at the end of 2023, thousands of guided bombs and missiles were delivered from the US to Israel. F-35 and F-15 fighter jets were also delivered to Israel from the US in January 2024.
CNN analysis has identified multiple instances that US-manufactured munitions were used throughout the war, including in strikes that killed civilians. Recently, CNN found that US-manufactured 2,000-pound bombs were likely used in the Israeli attack that killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut.
The US also provides financial assistance to Israel, delivering over $130 billion in bilateral funding since 1948, according to the US State Department. In 2019, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding that ensured the US would annually provide Israel with $3.3 billion from the Foreign Military Financing program, and another $500 million for missile defense.
Germany:
While in 2023, Germany contributed 30% of Israel’s weapons, that supply has significantly reduced over the course of 2024.
Earlier this year, the International Court of Justice rejected a request from Nicaragua to order Germany to stop supplying military aid to Israel. One of their key reasons was that German military aid to the country had fallen from approximately €200 million ($220 million) in October 2023 to €1 million ($1.1 million) by the time of the judgement in March.
But on October 10, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the country had not stopped providing Israel with arms, noting that Germany “(has) supplied weapons and we will supply weapons.” He added that weapons will be delivered to Israel “in the near future.”
Israeli security has historically been a core element of German foreign policy due to the Nazi Holocaust against Jews during World War II.
Italy:
Italy has provided helicopters and guns to Israel, according to the SIPRI, and is a partner of the F-35 fighter jet program, helping to manufacture parts.
However, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told local media in late January that Italy had stopped arms shipments to Israel since October 7 last year. Any deals signed before then were still being honored, SIPRI said.
Pagella Politica, an Italian monitoring organization, said Italian companies had sold arms worth almost $129 million to Israel in the decade to 2022.
The United Kingdom:
The British government says its “exports of military goods to Israel are low.” It said it granted licenses valued at $23.42 million in 2023. However, the UK has suspended some licenses to Israel for military equipment over the past year.
Foreign Minister David Lammy suspended around 30 licenses out of 350 to Israel upon the Labour government taking office in July, with an official assessment finding there was a clear risk that the weapons could be used “to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.”
The suspensions impacted the supply of some parts for drones and F-35 fighter jets. However, the UK government did not suspend supply of material not used in the Israel-Hamas conflict – for example, for training purposes.
Spain:
In February, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation issued a press release noting that the government had not issued any arms sales to Israel since October 7 last year.
On October 11, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez condemned what he described as an “unacceptable” Israeli offensive in Lebanon and urged the international community to stop arms exports to Israel.
“We are emphasizing the urgency for the Israeli government to cease its hostilities which are violating international law by invading a third country, in this case Lebanon, as well as International Humanitarian Law, as has even been questioned by the International Court of Justice,” he said.
France:
While France has historically provided Israel with arms, in recent weeks the relationship between the two countries has become strained as French President Emmanuel Macron called for an end to arms exports to Israel to try and push for a ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza.
On October 5, Macron called for the complete suspension of the sale of arms “used in the war in Gaza,” and stressed that France had not been involved in their supply. According to SIPRI, its data does not show any French exports of major arms to Israel from 2019-23, but it notes that France did supply components for arms.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/politics/israel-iran-conflict-election-day/index.html,US officials expect Israel’s counterattack on Iran will come before US Election Day,2024-10-16 11:51:57,"American officials expect Israel will retaliate against Iran for its attack earlier this month before November 5, sources tell CNN, a timeline that would thrust the growing volatility in the Middle East squarely into public view within days of the American presidential election.
The timeline and parameters of Israel’s retaliation against Iran have been subject to intense debate inside Israel’s government and are not directly related to the timing of the US election, the sources said.
Still, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — described by senior US administration officials as a political animal deeply attuned to American politics — appears highly sensitive to any potential political ramifications of Israel’s actions in the US, they said.
The growing conflict in the Middle East has emerged as a persistent issue in the American election. President Joe Biden, and by extension Vice President Kamala Harris, have faced pressure from progressives for their handling of the situation. Meanwhile, Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have accused the administration of bungling the crisis, sending the world into chaos.
As the election nears, the administration has begun applying new pressure on Israel to improve humanitarian conditions inside Gaza. In a stern letter revealed this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel a failure to deliver more aid to the enclave could trigger a cutoff of military assistance.
But in a sign of the fraught political dynamics, the letter was not signed from the president or the vice president, neither of whom has publicly threatened to cut off aid to Israel, despite pressure from the left. Its deadline for allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza falls after the election. And the warning came the same week an advanced US air defense system arrived in Israel to held defend the country against Iranian attacks.
How the conflict unfolds in the three weeks before Election Day remains one of the biggest uncertainties for the two presidential campaigns. While not a top-tier issue for many voters, the crisis has complicated Harris’ efforts to win Michigan, a state with a major concentration of Arab-American voters. She is campaigning in the state three days this week.
Strike could upend race
For Biden and Harris, an outbreak of a wider regional conflict would pose an unwelcome development on an issue that has already caused them major political headaches.
Netanyahu is acutely aware of how a potential counterstrike could reshape the presidential race, according to assessments from some US officials, adding a layer of complexity to the ongoing diplomacy between the two nations over the last several months.
Biden, in the wake of Iran’s missile attack earlier this month, did not try to dissuade Netanyahu from responding forcefully. But mindful of the prospects of all-out war or spiking oil prices on the presidential race, he and his team have worked to encourage a measured reprisal.
Biden administration officials have been notably tight-lipped about both the timing and targets of Israel’s forthcoming counterstrike after Iran launched some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish state earlier this month.
Netanyahu informed Biden last week that Israel does not intend to go after Iran’s nuclear or oil sites during this round of retaliation, CNN previously reported, a message that was received with relief inside the White House. Biden had publicly encouraged Israel to avoid those targets.
In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said, “We listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interests,” an indication that despite whatever assurances he offered Biden, the scope of Israel’s response could be different than what the White House has encouraged.
It is not known whether Israel’s attacks on Iran would be limited to physical targeting of military assets or also include a cyber warfare component. US officials will be closely monitoring not only its ally’s counterattack but the response it will elicit from Iran, as the Biden administration hopes to avoid another full-fledged war from breaking out in the Middle East.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, White House spokesman John Kirby said “there’s little doubt that the Iranians know how seriously” the US takes its commitment to Israel’s right to self-defense.
“But I don’t think it’d be useful for me, one way or another, to get into the specifics of the diplomacy,” Kirby said, as he declined to comment on ways in which US officials may have been working to try to shape Israel’s eventual response to Iran.
Biden has urged measured response
Yet in many ways, those efforts have played out publicly. Biden, speaking to reporters on several occasions earlier this month, urged a measured response, and suggested he was conveying those views to Israel directly.
In a telephone conversation last week, Biden and Netanyahu held a “direct” conversation about the plans for responding to Iran, according to the White House. Harris also joined the classified call, describing it later as an “important” discussion.
American officials were extraordinarily tight-tipped about the two leaders’ conversation. Previous calls between the men have grown tense as Biden confronted what he regarded as a lack of cooperation from Netanyahu on securing an end to the war.
Biden has grown frustrated that Netanyahu appears to brush off his advice and recommendations, and to publicly reject his attempts at lowering regional temperatures. Some American officials have privately speculated the Israeli leader is looking to boost Trump in the weeks ahead of November’s election.
Yet until this week, Biden had stopped well short of threatening to condition American assistance to Israel on efforts to improve humanitarian conditions.
In their letter, sent Sunday, Blinken and Austin said they were writing “to underscore the U.S. government’s deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory,” laying out a number of benchmarks the country must meet, including allowing at least 350 aid trucks per day into Gaza.
Though it wasn’t signed by Biden, the letter reflected the president’s previous efforts, according to White House aides.
“This is not an initiative that the President was at all surprised by,” Kirby told reporters Tuesday. “It very much in keeping with the communications that he has had with Prime Minister Netanyahu.”","['MJ Lee', 'Kevin Liptak']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/middleeast/israel-gaza-time-running-out-ceasefire-deal-intl-cmd/index.html,Families in Gaza and Israel fear time is running out for a deal,2024-10-16 10:11:23,"In one of Gaza’s last standing hospitals, Tamara Al-Maarouf’s eyes well up with tears as she stands helplessly by her baby boy’s hospital bed. A tumor, now removed, has been compressing the 4-month-old’s tiny heart and he desperately needs treatment abroad.
Meanwhile, 84-year-old Oded Lifschitz, who was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 last year by Hamas militants, is still being held hostage in the enclave. His family is still desperately trying to bring him home.
The stories of two lives, those of a Palestinian infant and an elderly Israeli man, tell the tragic tale of the countless innocent lives trapped in a war they did not choose. Their fates are now tied up in politics and negotiations that have all but failed.
The baby, Jihad, can barely breathe or feed. His mother, Tamara, struggles to find ways to comfort him as he cries and wriggles around, with tubes sticking out of his mouth and nose.
Like thousands of other patients in Gaza, he is in urgent need of foreign medical treatment, but these evacuations have all but ceased since May, when Israel took control of the Rafah border crossing.
Israeli authorities have only allowed a fraction of the estimated 12,000 Palestinians awaiting transfer – many of whom are children – to leave Gaza for treatment.
More than a year of devastating Israeli strikes and the accompanying siege of the enclave have decimated the health sector, leaving medical workers with very little with which to save lives. Hospitals are not only overwhelmed with those injured in the conflict, but they’re now dealing with preventable diseases that are spreading at an alarming rate.
In August, an 11-month-old boy became the first person in Gaza in 25 years to be diagnosed with polio after Israel’s military campaign destroyed water and sanitation systems, leading to a resurgence of the deadly disease.
In September, the World Health Organization administered the first of two doses of the polio vaccine to more than half a million children aged below 10 in Gaza, with the second round of the emergency vaccination drive now under way, according to the UN children’s agency, UNICEF. The UN said it cancelled vaccinations at one school being used as a displacement shelter after it was damaged by an Israeli airstrike.
And there are many like Jihad who are suffering from serious conditions, chronic illnesses and cancer who cannot be appropriately treated in Gaza.
Doctors at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital told CNN there were neither the specialists nor the necessary equipment there properly to diagnose and treat Jihad, and so they found themselves with no choice but to operate to remove the tumor and relieve the pressure on his heart, despite the risks.
Speaking to CNN before her son’s operation, Al-Maarouf was unable to hold back her tears as she begged the international community for help.
“These are children, they are not carrying weapons,” she told CNN. “Why can’t he be evacuated?”
Against all odds, baby Jihad survived the surgery. But doctors were unable to remove the tumor entirely, his mother told CNN last week. One month on from the operation, he is still suffering from weight loss, diarrhea, fever, and a loss of appetite, she said.
Thousands of miles away, in her London home, Sharone Lifschitz scrolled through black and white photos saved on her phone as she met with CNN last month. She beamed with pride as she pointed to one of her mother, Yocheved Lifschitz, taken decades ago, with a sign in Hebrew that reads “Shalom,” or peace.
Her parents were longtime advocates for peace. In recent years, the elderly couple were part of a volunteer group of Israelis who would drive Gazans from the border to hospitals in East Jerusalem and the West Bank for treatment. Her father, Oded Lifschitz, kept his driving license so he could continue these missions, she said.
“My father believed in thinking big and solving the difficult issue… He was very much for the two-state solution,” Lifschitz told CNN. “He believed we can reach agreements with the Palestinians.”
On the morning of October 7 last year, Oded and Yocheved were kidnapped from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, the site of one of the worst massacres of the Hamas attack on that day.
Yocheved, now 86, was abducted while still in her nightgown, thrown onto the back of a motorbike and taken to Gaza. At the end of October, she was released by Hamas on humanitarian grounds.
The last time Yocheved saw her husband of more than 60 years was last October 7. He was lying on the ground injured, after he was shot in the hand by the militants who stormed their home.
“He survived and his spirit survived,” their daughter told CNN. “We know he looked for my mom on the first day,” she said, citing testimony from hostages who were released. “We know that he was helping the other hostages he shared a room with. My father was a very helpful, kind and generous man.”
It is that kindness and generosity, as well as his ability to speak Arabic, that the family hopes will have helped a frail, elderly man with medical conditions survive in captivity.
They have now been waiting for his return for over a year. In May, Oded turned 84 in Hamas captivity.
Lifschitz wears a dog tag around her neck with a photo of her father and “84” engraved on it, along with the message, “Waiting for you at home.”
“Hamas took elderly, elderly people; they did not need them, and they could have returned them without a deal,” Lifschitz said. “There is no deal needed to return an 84-year-old man. There is no deal needed to return a 1-year-old baby. The fact that Hamas is using them to reach a deal is horrific.”
But Lifshitz, like many Israelis, still believes the only way out of this nightmare is a deal between Israel and Hamas that would stop the war and secure the release of the hostages.
She fears they are losing what feels like a race against time to bring them home alive.
“We are so exhausted and so heartbroken again and again,” Sharone said. “We are not giving up. We do not have the luxury of giving up.”
Hopes for a ceasefire deal and hostage release deal have been shattered repeatedly by failing negotiations. Both Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for derailing the efforts, leaving mediators from the United States, Qatar and Egypt scrambling to save talks that have stalled for months.
In July, a deal appeared imminent, but sources have told CNN that last-minute demands by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu undermined and created obstacles to an agreement. US officials have since blamed both Israel and Hamas for adding conditions that have left talks deadlocked. Hostage families have repeatedly accused Netanyahu of purposefully prolonging the war and torpedoing deals for his own political benefit.
Hanging in the balance are the lives of more than 100 Israeli hostages and Gaza’s population of 2.2 million, all trapped in a besieged enclave that has become a “hell on Earth,” according to aid agencies which have been pleading for a ceasefire to save lives.
Those who survive Israel’s bombardment, which has killed more than 42,000 people, according to Palestinian authorities, face what Gaza residents like al-Maarouf describe as a slow death under siege, with conditions growing more catastrophic by the day.
“He is a child who has nothing to do with what is happening,” the distraught mother told CNN last month. “What did a 4-month-old do?”
Lifschitz said she thinks the mediators could do more to get a deal done. She wants Egypt and Qatar to put more pressure on Hamas but, for her, it is US President Joe Biden who could make this deal happen.
“I believe it is President Biden at this very moment that must do what it takes to bring them back home… I believe he is our best hope,” she said.
Lifschitz refuses to compare her own government’s position to that of a militant group like Hamas, but said: “Anybody who is interested in history sees people that are caught in the tide of time and political and military fanatical regimes that are putting their own agenda above human lives… Both nations are incredibly unlucky in the leaders that are guiding them at the moment.
For Israelis like Lifschitz, the race to save the lives of their loved ones took a more urgent turn in early September after the Israeli military retrieved the bodies of six hostages executed by Hamas.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had been “brutally” murdered “a short while” before Israeli troops were able to reach them. Hamas, meanwhile, issued a chilling threat that more hostages would return in coffins if Israeli forces tried to rescue them.
Three of the six had been expected to be released as part of an eventual ceasefire agreement, Israeli officials told CNN.
These were young people who had every chance of survival, and they survived for almost a year,” said an emotional Lifschitz. “It is a failure; we have failed them.”
The families of hostages fear for the safety of their loved ones, not only in relation to their captors, but also Israeli military operations, not least the relentless bombardment that has flattened much of Gaza.
Last month, the IDF confirmed that three hostages whose bodies were recovered in December were “most likely” killed in an Israeli strike. The military had previously admitted mistakenly shooting and killing three other hostages last year and said it was investigating the circumstances of the deaths of six hostages whose bodies were recovered in June.
While prospects of an agreement appear bleak, Lifschitz said she would not stop fighting for the release of her father and the other hostages.
Asked what she would tell her father if he could hear her, Lifschitz said, choking back tears: “Forgive us. Forgive us. We have tried so hard. And know that we hear your voice in our heads… You know, we tried the way he tried all his life. He tried for many years to avert this disaster.
“I hear him now saying, ‘work for peace, work for the possibility of humans in this region to live together,’” she added.","['Jomana Karadsheh', 'Muhammad Darwish', 'Abeer Salman']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/us-israel-gaza-humanitarian-situation-letter/index.html,US suggests military aid to Israel is at risk in letter demanding more aid for Gaza,2024-10-15 14:13:06,"The Biden administration sent a letter to the Israeli government demanding it act to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy.
The Sunday letter, jointly written by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, is addressed to Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant and Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. It marks a significant new step by the US to try to compel Israel to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
They write that the US has deep concerns about the situation and ask for “urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory.”
Since this Spring, the amount of aid delivered to Gaza has dropped more than 50% and the quantity delivered in September “was the lowest of any month during the past year,” they added.
The deadline falls after the US presidential election on November 5.
Despite the stern warning, however, the US has continued to provide military assistance to Israel. In May, President Joe Biden threatened to cut off bombs and artillery to Israel if it launched a major invasion of Rafah. Israel did, however, launch an invasion into Rafah and the Biden administration still announced a $1 Billion weapon package to Israel shortly after. Earlier this week, the US sent an advanced air defense system and US troops to Israel amid heightend tensions in the region.
Future US aid could be at risk, however. The letter, dated October 13, notes that the US State and Defense departments, under US law, “must continually assess” Israel’s adherence to its assurances made earlier this year that it would not restrict aid flows into the enclave.
A US defense official said that the administration hopes the letter will convince the Israelis to act. “Secretary Blinken sent a similar letter in April, which received a constructive response and concrete measures from the Israelis,” the official said. “ This letter follows a recent decrease in assistance reaching Gaza, which we aim to similarly address with concrete measures.”
The US’ list of demands is extensive. Israel must allow at least 350 trucks a day to enter Gaza through all four major crossings, the letter says, in addition to opening a fifth crossing. Israel must also over the next month implement humanitarian pauses across Gaza as necessary to enable humanitarian activities, including vaccinations and aid distribution for at least the next four months.
The US is also demanding that Israel allow people in the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone inside Gaza to move inland before winter and enhance security for humanitarian convoys and movements.
Israel must also take action to ensure that the Jordan Armed forces corridors are functioning at “full and continuous capacity.”
The letter closes by calling for a new channel between the US and Israeli governments to “raise and discuss civilian harm incidents,” with the first meeting to be held at the end of the month.
Israel’s military operations in northern Gaza have intensified in recent weeks, and the Israeli military has called on civilians there to evacuate to the south, where more than one million displaced Palestinians are already sheltering. The UN World Food Programme warned last weekend that Israeli military operations are having a “disastrous impact” on food security for Palestinian families.
Blinken and Austin wrote that the Israeli government’s actions appear to be contributing to the worsening humanitarian situation.
“We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government – including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90 percent of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments – together with increased lawlessness and looting – are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,” they said.
Israel appears to already be responding to the letter, at least indirectly. Just one day after the letter was sent, COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages policy for the Palestinian territories and the flow of aid into the strip, tweeted photos of aid going into Gaza.
“30 trucks entered northern Gaza through the Erez Crossing earlier today. Israel is not preventing the entry of humanitarian aid, with an emphasis on food, into Gaza,” COGAT said in a post on X. “Israel will continue to allow the entry of humanitarian aid to the residents of Gaza, while simultaneously destroying Hamas’ military and governance infrastructures.”

President Joe Biden, who has conveyed in public his opposition to striking Tehran’s nuclear and oil facilities, discussed Israel’s plans with Netanyahu during a classified phone call last week. In that conversation, Netanyahu relayed to Biden his plan to hit military targets, the person said.
The Washington Post first reported that Netanyahu had reassured Biden of his plans to avoid nuclear and oil targets.
Responding to that report, Netanyahu’s office said it will consider US opinions but ultimately decide its response to Iran’s October 1 attack based on its own national interests. And American officials said they were still closely coordinating with Israel as it decides how to respond.
“We listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interests,” Netanyahu’s office wrote on X.
The White House previously described the phone call between the leaders last week as “productive” and “direct.” It was their first conversation in nearly two months.
“Our commitment to Israel’s defense is ironclad. We will not discuss private diplomatic discussions and would refer you to the Israeli government to speak to their own potential military operations,” a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council said Tuesday.
Israel’s deliberations over how to respond to Iran come at a moment of high tensions in the year-long conflict, which has expanded beyond Gaza into Lebanon. At the White House, officials have worked to limit Israel’s retaliation to the barrage of ballistic missiles, hoping to prevent a wider war.
Still, Biden and other top officials have maintained Israel has a right to respond, and have said they were in close coordination with their counterparts as they mulled a decision.
A strike on oil fields that could send energy prices soaring would be unwelcome weeks ahead of the US election, officials have said. And hitting Iran’s nuclear facilities could trigger the full-blown regional war that Biden has desperately sought to avoid.
American officials have said they expected a measured response from Israel, believing the country did not want an out-of-control conflict with Iran. But Biden’s leverage with Netanyahu has been limited as he has struggled to bring the violence to an end in Gaza and contain a wider war.",['Kevin Liptak'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html,Deadly drone attack by Hezbollah exposes Israel’s weaknesses,2024-10-14 16:20:40,"The deadly attack by Hezbollah against an army base deep inside Israeli territory presents a major headache for Israel as it continues to struggle to defuse the threat from the Iran-backed militant group, despite launching a major bombardment campaign and a ground operation against it.
Launched from southern Lebanon, a drone was able to penetrate Israeli air defenses undetected and hit the Golani Brigade’s base some 40 miles into Israel from the border. It struck on Sunday just after 7pm – at dinner time – and while the military has not released any details about the impact site, photos from the scene make it clear the drone hit the base’s dining hall.
Both the timing and the location of the strike suggest that Hezbollah had gathered enough intelligence and possesses the capabilities to maximize the number of casualties. The Golani Brigade is regarded as an elite Israeli infantry unit and has been deployed to southern Lebanon as part of Israel’s ground operation there.
Four soldiers were killed, and more than 60 others were injured, eight of them seriously, bringing the total number of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers killed since the start of the ground operation two weeks ago to at least 18.
Sunday’s assault is also the single bloodiest attack on IDF troops inside Israel since the beginning of the war last October.
Daniel Sobelman, an international security expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that it shows Hezbollah is still able to strike.
“It is a clear indication that Hezbollah is regaining its strategic balance following the recent devastating blows to its leadership and command and control apparatuses,” he told CNN, referring to the killing of Hezbollah’s long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top officials.
Israel’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. But they have been designed and developed primarily to counter rockets and missiles, not drones that can be launched from anywhere, fly low and slow, and change directions quickly.
And while the IDF has not said what type of aircraft was used in Sunday’s attack, experts told CNN it was most likely a Mirsad drone, a type known in Iran as Ababil drones.
Orna Mizrahi, a senior research fellow at the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, told CNN that such unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are harder to detect because they “are small in size, very light, with very low radar signature.”
Iran and its allies are seeking to overwhelm Israel’s defense systems, Mizrahi said, adding drones to the equation after identifying them as “a weakness” for Israel.
“Every time we find a solution for something, they find another way to attack,” she said.
Residents in Israel are well trained when it comes to evading dangers from above. Most people head to the shelters – omnipresent in much of the country – or duck down in a ditch whenever they hear the sirens indicating an imminent aerial threat.
But the drone sent by Hezbollah at the weekend managed to slip through without triggering Israel’s alert systems. The soldiers in the dining hall were attacked without any warning.
And it was not the first time this has happened.
In June, Hezbollah released a nine-minute video filmed by a drone showing civilian and military locations in and around one of Israel’s largest cities, Haifa. That UAV also appeared to have gone undetected by the IDF.
In response to the video, IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi said at the time that the Israeli military was “preparing and coming up with solutions to deal with these and other capabilities.”
Then in July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. No sirens were activated during that attack. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other one was not – due to what it said was a human error.
The tactic of sending two drones also appears to have been replicated by Hezbollah last week.
The IDF said two drones were launched from Lebanon on Friday, adding that it had intercepted one of them, but not disclosing what happened to the other one. A nursing home in the coastal city of Herzliya, central Israel, was damaged in the attack, but no casualties were reported.
It is very likely that the same strategy was deployed on Sunday. Shortly before the first reports of the attack against the Golani Brigade base, the IDF said it had intercepted an UAV launched from Lebanon in the northern naval area of Israel. That suggests the drone that hit the base was a second aircraft fired either simultaneously or shortly before or after the first one. The IDF did not comment on the number of drones that were launched on Sunday.
Hezbollah said it had fired dozens of rockets toward the northern Israeli towns of Nahariya and Acre to engage Israel’s air defense systems, while simultaneously launching the drones.
Difficult fight
Hezbollah continues to be able to fire at Israel despite the IDF launching an intense aerial bombardment inside Lebanon as well as a limited ground operation targeting the group.
More than 1,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since September 16, when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of Lebanese health ministry statements.
When the IDF launched its ground operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, it insisted that any action across the border would be “limited” in both geographical scope and duration and aimed at dismantling Hezbollah’s military infrastructure in the border areas.
Some 60,000 people have been evacuated from northern Israel since Hezbollah began firing barrages of rockets at Israel on October 8 last year in support of Hamas in Gaza, which had launched deadly attacks against Israel a day earlier.
But the reality on the ground indicates Israel might be preparing for the possibility of a much bigger war. It has deployed units from four divisions to southern Lebanon and ordered the residents of a quarter of Lebanon’s territory to evacuate. More than 1.2 million people are now displaced, according to the United Nations.
The IDF doesn’t disclose its troop numbers, but each division is thought to consist of some 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers.
Analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said that last time Israel invaded Lebanon in 2006, it sent around 30,000 troops across the border.
That war ended in stalemate after 34 days, after some 1,100 Lebanese and about 170 Israelis, including 120 soldiers, were killed.
CSIS said that a new operation on the ground could require a bigger force than the one Israel deployed in 2006 against Hezbollah. Yet even that may not be enough.
“Hezbollah’s ability to pursue a war of attrition, disrupt life in much of northern Israel, and impose painful costs on Israel shows that it is regaining its operational stability,” Sobelman, the international security expert, told CNN.
He said that in guerrilla wars, what often matters the most is the weaker actor’s ability to keep going, fight and inflict losses on the other side.
With the IDF death toll from its war on Hezbollah rising, it is clear the militant group is determined to keep going – despite the momentous blows it has suffered.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

Israel’s attacks on the peacekeeping mission, which has operated in Lebanon for more than 45 years, have been widely condemned by the international community. UNIFIL – the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon – has called the violations “shocking.”
Israel has accused Hezbollah of operating in areas near UNIFIL posts. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Sunday that UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon are in “harm’s way.” He expressed regret that some UN peacekeepers had been injured over the past week and called on UN secretary general António Guterres to get the peacekeepers out “immediately.”
Guterres said that attacks on peacekeepers “may constitute a war crime,” and that “UNIFIL and its premises must never be targeted.” The UN has said that its troops remain in Lebanon despite the attacks.
Here’s what to know:
What’s happened in the past week?
UNIFIL’s Naqoura headquarters and nearby positions have been repeatedly hit by Israel.
On Wednesday, UNIFIL said IDF soldiers “deliberately fired at and disabled” a UN position in Labbouneh.
Two peacekeepers were injured Thursday after an IDF tank fired toward an observation tower at UNIFIL’s headquarters, directly hitting it and causing them to fall.
On Friday, two UNIFIL troops were injured after two explosions occurred close to an observation tower. The IDF said it was responding to what it identified as an “immediate threat” against it, adding that it had instructed UNIFIL personnel to move.
Later Friday, a peacekeeper was shot in Naquora amid “military activity,” according to UNIFIL, which said UN buildings in Ramyah had sustained “significant damage” due to explosions from nearby shellings.
On Saturday, UNIFIL said IDF soldiers stopped a critical UNIFIL logistical movement near Meiss ej Jebel.
And early Sunday, UNIFIL said the IDF violated international law after backing its tanks into its post in Ramyah, forcibly entering the position and requesting that the base turn off its lights. The IDF later said one of its tanks backed into the post because it was evacuating soldiers wounded by an anti-tank missile.
Israel’s actions have drawn condemnation from several of its allies, including France and the UK, who said it was “appalled” by reports that Israel deliberately targeted UN bases last week.
What is UNIFIL?
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was established by the UN Security Council following Israel’s first invasion into southern Lebanon in 1978.
Its mandate was to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the country, restore international peace and security, and assist the Lebanese government to restore its effective authority in the area.
In June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon for a second time and subsequently established a security zone inside the country, which remained until its withdrawal in 2000.
In 2000 UNIFIL established the Blue Line – an area spanning 120 kilometers (around 75 miles) along southern Lebanon to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces. It acts as a de-facto border between the two countries since Lebanon and Israel have an ongoing border dispute.
The UNIFIL troops are tasked with monitoring border violations and keeping the area, which includes Hezbollah strongholds – secure.
While UNIFIL is a peacekeeping mission, troops can use force in certain circumstances, including self-defense, to protect civilians under the imminent threat of violence and to protect UN personnel facilities and equipment.
UNIFIL’s mandate is renewed annually by the UN Security Council at the request of Lebanon. The Security Council most recently extended the mandate until August 31, 2025.
Who makes up UNIFIL?
The mission is made up of more than 10,000 personnel from 50 countries, the majority of whom are troops.
Indonesia, Italy, India, Nepal, Ghana and Malaysia contribute the most troops. Spain, China, Ireland and France also make up a large presence. Some countries contribute only one UNIFIL troop, like the United Kingdom, Peru and Nigeria.
The peacekeepers operate in a 410 square mile area between the Blue Line and the Litani River in southern Lebanon. They hold 50 positions, with the UNIFIL headquarters situated in Naqoura in the southwest of the country.",['Kara Fox'],en

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, launched by Hezbollah hit an army base adjacent to Binyamina, a town north of Tel Aviv that lies some 40 miles from the Lebanese border.
The four killed soldiers were all 19 years old and in infantry training at the base, the IDF said, adding that eight other soldiers were severely injured.
According to Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service, a total of 61 people were wounded in the attack, with dozens still hospitalized.
The news comes after Hezbollah said Sunday it had fired a swarm of attack drones on an Israeli infantry training camp in Binyamina.
The Lebanon-based militant group said the attack was in response to deadly Israeli strikes in Lebanon Thursday.
Hezbollah said it had targeted the Golani Brigade, an infantry unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that has been deployed in southern Lebanon. The claim of responsibility for the attack came shortly after the militant group released an audio message from its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah calling on its members to “defend your people, your family, your nation, your values and your dignity.”
Earlier on Sunday, the IDF said it had intercepted a Lebanon-launched UAV without specifying where. It was not immediately clear whether this was the same incident that led to the injuries.
Israeli air defence systems tend to be very reliable, but on Sunday, there were no reports of alerts in the Binyamina area at the time of the attack, raising questions of how the drone was able to penetrate so deep into the Israeli territory without being spotted.
Hezbollah said it had fired dozens of rockets toward the northern Israeli towns of Nahariya and Acre to engage Israel’s air defense systems, while simultaneously launching the drone swarm.
“These drones broke through the Israel defense radars without detection and reached its target at the training camp of the elite Golani Brigade in Binyamina,” Hezbollah said.
The IDF’s top spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the military would investigate how the drone got through without raising an alarm at the base.
“We will learn from and investigate the incident,” he said in a video statement from the base. “The threat of UAVs is a threat we are dealing with since the beginning of the war. We need an improvement to our defense,” he added.
‘Very difficult scene’
The Binyamina attack comes almost two weeks after Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon. The IDF has insisted the operation is “localized” and “limited” – even though the reality on the ground suggests it might be preparing for a wider invasion.
The IDF has issued evacuation orders for a quarter of Lebanon’s territory and deployed units from four different IDF divisions to the border area, while also continuing an intense bombardment campaign.
More than 1,500 people have been killed and more than 8,000 injured in Lebanon since September 16, when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of Lebanese health ministry statements.
Tensions rose again on Sunday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the United Nations peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to withdraw from the area following several incidents involving the IDF that left five members of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) injured.
The 40 countries whose soldiers serve as UN peacekeepers in Lebanon issued a statement on Sunday “strongly condemning” these attacks.
At the same time, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel would not allow Hezbollah to return to border villages in southern Lebanon after Israeli troops leave the area.
Despite the ground operation targeting its infrastructure, Hezbollah continues to fire dozens of rockets into Israel on daily basis.
The attack on Sunday also raises concerns over Hezbollah’s ability to use longer-range drones against Israel, as it comes just two days after another attack in which the IDF said two drones were launched from Lebanon.
The Israeli military said Friday it had intercepted one of those drones, but did not specify what happened to the other one. In the attack Friday, warning sirens had activated and while a nursing home in the coastal city of Herzliya, central Israel, was damaged, no casualties were no reported.
Magen David Adom said it declared a mass casualty event on Sunday evening and had evacuated 61 injured people from the scene. It said three people were in serious condition and 18 suffered moderate injuries.
A statement from the emergency service quoted a paramedic at the site as saying it “was a very difficult scene.”
“We declared it a mass casualty event and treated patients suffering from blast injuries and shrapnel. The injuries were severe, and we evacuated the injured to hospitals as quickly as possible for further medical treatment,” Rafi Sheva said in the statement.
Those injured in Binyamina were transported to eight different hospitals across Israel, according to Magen David Adom.
The Laniado Hospital in north-central Israel treated several of the people who suffered light injuries.
Its spokesperson Asahel Shahaf said that one man who was brought into the emergency room had a lucky escape when shrapnel from the drone lodged into his kippah, a head covering worn by Jewish men.
“The shrapnel did not scratch the wounded man,” Shahaf said, calling the incident “a small (big!!!) miracle.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/thaad-missile-interceptors-israel-defense-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,What is THAAD? The powerful US anti-missile defense system is being sent to Israel,2024-10-14 06:37:28,"The THAAD defense system is one of the US military’s most powerful anti-missile weapons, capable of intercepting ballistic missiles at ranges of 150 to 200 kilometers (93 to 124 miles) and with a near-perfect success rate in testing.
Using a combination of advanced radar systems and interceptors, THAAD, short for Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, is the only US missile defense system that can engage and destroy short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles both inside or outside the atmosphere during their terminal phase of flight – or dive on their target.
THAAD interceptors are kinetic, meaning they take out incoming targets by colliding with them rather than exploding near the incoming warhead.
According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the US military has seven THAAD batteries, each consisting of six truck-mounted launchers – with eight interceptors apiece – a powerful radar system and a fire control and communications component.
One of those prized batteries is now being dispatched to Israel to help bolster its already impressive ability to counter incoming missiles “following Iran’s unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1,” according to the Pentagon. But to do that, it needs US boots on the ground.
The US Army will dispatch about 100 troops to Israel to operate the battery, according to the Pentagon. Iran has informed the US it would retaliate against any new attack by Israel, a source in Tehran told CNN on Saturday.
Through a broad command and control and battle management system, THAAD batteries can communicate with a range of US missile defenses, including Aegis systems – commonly found aboard US Navy ships – and Patriot missile defense systems that are designed to intercept shorter-range targets.
Those other missile defense systems are more numerous than THAAD, an illustration of the importance the Biden administration is placing on this deployment to Israel.
THAAD can be quickly deployed by US Air Force cargo aircraft like the C-17 and C-5, but the Pentagon did not give a timetable for when it will be active in Israel.
What makes THAAD so accurate?
What makes THAAD so accurate is the radar system that supplies its targeting information, the Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance radar, or AN/TPY-2.
The radar system, which can deployed with the missile battery or already be in place on US Navy ships or at other installations, can detect missiles in two ways. In its forward-based mode it is configured to acquire and track targets at ranges of up to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles), and in its terminal mode it is aimed upward to acquire targets during their descent, according to the Missile Defense Project. Iran is about 1,700 kilometers (1,100 miles from Israel.)
THAAD would not be acting alone in any defense of Israel and could act as a further “deterrent” to an attack, said CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton, a former US Air Force colonel.
“When it is put in place, it will actually add a layer to the existing Israeli air and missile defenses,” Leighton said.
Production models of the THAAD system have never failed to intercept incoming targets in testing, according to the Missile Threat Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
What about Israel’s other anti-missile systems?
Israel has multiple anti-missile systems already in place designed to shoot down incoming projectiles.
David’s Sling, a joint project of Israel’s RAFAEL Advanced Defense System and US defense giant Raytheon, uses Stunner and SkyCeptor kinetic hit-to-kill interceptors to take out targets as far as 300 kilometers away (186 miles), according to the Missile Threat Project.
Above David’s Sling are Israel’s Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, jointly developed with the United States.
The Arrow 2 uses fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase – as they dive toward their targets – in the upper atmosphere, according to the CSIS.
Meanwhile, the Arrow 3 uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, as THAAD can do.
The lowest level of projectiles fired at Israel is combatted by the Iron Dome defense system, made up of 10 batteries that each carry three to four maneuverable missile launchers.
This isn’t the first time Washington has sent a THAAD battery to Israel. One was dispatched in 2019 for an exercise.
Elsewhere THAAD deployments have also been watched closely by US rivals, most notably China.
The deployment of a THAAD battery to South Korea in 2017, as ballistic missile threats from North Korea ramped up, drew vehement opposition from Beijing, which experts said was worried that the powerful radar could be used to spy on activities well inside China.
The US has also deployed THAAD to Guam, to protect vital US military bases on the Pacific island from possible ballistic missile threats from North Korea or China.",['Brad Lendon'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/politics/israel-iran-antimissile-system-us-troops/index.html,US to deploy about 100 troops to operate advanced anti-missile system in Israel amid heightened tensions,2024-10-13 16:21:24,"The US will send an advanced anti-missile system — and US troops to operate it — to Israel “to help bolster Israel’s air defenses following Iran’s unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1,” the Pentagon said Sunday.
It is not the first time the US has deployed the system, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery, to the Middle East, Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said in the statement, and the system was also deployed to Israel in 2019 for an exercise. But the deployment of additional US troops to Israel is notable amid the heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, and as the region braces for a potential Israeli attack on Iran that could continue to escalate hostilities.
Approximately 100 US troops are deploying to Israel to operate the THAAD battery, according to a US defense official. It is rare for US troops to deploy inside Israel, but this is a typical number of troops to operate the anti-missile defense system.
The THAAD system is specifically meant for anti-ballistic missile defense and could help Israel better defend itself against a future Iranian attack if Iran decides to respond to any Israeli strike.
The US has been consulting with Israel on how it plans to respond to Iran’s October 1 attack on the country, and US officials have made clear they do not want Israel to target Iranian nuclear sites or oil fields. US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months, telling him Israel’s retaliation should be “proportional.”
The US military has significantly increased its presence in the Middle East since October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel. The US has bolstered its air defenses across the region, deployed additional warships and aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean, Red Sea and Arabian Sea, and recently sent additional troops to Cyprus to help with possible evacuation planning, CNN previously reported.",['Natasha Bertrand'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/us/american-killed-lebanon-israeli-airstrike/index.html,"Lebanese American killed by Israeli airstrike while caring for those who were displaced, family says",2024-10-13 05:00:38,"When Israeli airstrikes began raining down on southern Lebanon, Kamel Ahmad Jawad’s first instinct wasn’t to seek safety or return to the US. Instead, he volunteered at a hospital to help those who couldn’t run – even if they wanted to.
On October 1, Jawad, a 56-year-old American citizen, father of four and cherished figure in the Dearborn, Michigan, community, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, his family says. The tragedy attests to fears of the conflict spilling over into the wider region being realized as Israel expands its assault.
“We are honored by my father’s sacrifice. In his last days, he chose to stay near the main hospital in Nabatieh to help the elderly, disabled, injured, and those who simply couldn’t financially afford to flee,” his daughter, Nadine Jawad, wrote in a statement on Facebook.
”He served as their guardian, provided them with food, mattresses, and other comforts, and anonymously paid off their debts. I would often ask him if he was scared, and he repeatedly told me that we should not be scared because he is doing what he loves the most: helping others live in the land he loved the most.”
Israeli airstrikes were reported in Nabatieh, Jawad’s hometown where he was killed, over the past week, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military, which said they could not comment without being given the exact coordinates and time of the strike that killed Jawad.
Israel has pummeled Lebanon with an unprecedented airstrike campaign, killing over 1,400 people, injuring nearly 7,500 others and displacing more than a million people from their homes, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The bombardment, which Israel says is targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the country, marks the world’s “most intense aerial campaign” outside of Gaza in the last two decades, according to the conflict monitoring group Airwars.
In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Yet much of the Western world has designated the Iran-backed group a terrorist organization.
Israel and Hezbollah have been locked in tit-for-tat escalation since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a deadly attack in Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli officials. In the ensuing war in Gaza, Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive has so far killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Militant groups from Lebanon to Yemen – as well as Iran – have responded by launching attacks on Israel, which has responded in kind, heightening fears of a wider regional war.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war is only with Hezbollah and not the Lebanese people, and that the Israeli military has repeatedly instructed civilians to evacuate areas under bombardment. Lebanese officials have accused Israel of indiscriminately bombing populated civilian areas, including the capital Beirut.
CNN teams in Beirut this week found that many Israeli strikes happened without prior warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping. As a result, the death toll in Lebanon continues to rise, with a fifth of its population now displaced.
But for Jawad, it was the people – not the geopolitics – that mattered most.
“In his last moments, my father was calm. He emphasized our collective responsibility to help the oppressed. Even as he witnessed destruction from the missiles falling around him, his certainty in the importance of caring for community – in any and every capacity possible – remained,” his daughter wrote.
“Our father’s message was clear: stop arming, aiding, and abetting our oppression and start caring for the people struggling for their freedom and dignity.”
An American community in mourning
Jawad’s killing has ignited an outpouring of love and fond memories in Dearborn, home to the largest Arab American and Lebanese communities in the US.
In the days since his death, friends, family, community members and local officials have posted tributes online to the man they say was beloved for his selflessness and dedication to both his American and Lebanese communities.
Many recall him as a kind, generous person who didn’t like to make a fuss out of his good deeds. He was known for saving money each year to return to Lebanon and help people, feeding them and paying off strangers’ debts without them ever knowing it was him, friends said. Jawad was also the founder of the nonprofit Lebanese Diaspora Relief Org, which provides families in Lebanon who are in need with food and medical supplies.
“There are some people in this world who when you meet them, sincerity shines out from them,” Hamzah Raza, Jawad’s friend, said in a statement on Facebook. “He was someone who loved people. And loved helping people.
“We applaud him on leaving this world as a martyr,” Raza said. “Yet we are sad for humanity. We are sad at the oppression of the Israeli state. We are sad that an American was killed by (Israel) with weapons given to him by his own government.”
American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee National Executive Director Abed Ayoub, who is Lebanese and from Dearborn, told CNN that Jawad was a well-respected member of the community who contributed to its betterment every day.
“He’s leaving behind an incredible legacy, and someone that’s going to truly be missed, somebody that really embodies the best of Lebanon and the best of Dearborn in the US,” Ayoub told CNN. “It’s a tragic loss for the community, a tragic loss for his family, for his parents, for all of us in the city.”
US Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Debbie Dingell of Michigan are among the many who paid tribute to Jawad and his family.
Other Lebanese American families in Dearborn also are grieving the loss of loved ones back home, including Ali Dabaja, who said at least five family members were recently killed by Israeli airstrikes in Bint Jbeil, a city in southern Lebanon. His cousin Batoul Dabaja-Saad, her husband and their three children – the youngest 8 years old – were buried beneath the rubble of their home, he said.
Dabaja, who is close friends with the Jawad family and says he is heartbroken over his killing, said the Dearborn community is in “collective mourning” and that every death – including every Palestinian killed by Israel since October 7 – has caused the community the same measure of pain.
“These are all lives that mean something to us, every single one of those human beings, those Arabs, those brown faces, have been allowed to die, but they had stories and ambitions and every single time one of those lives are lost for us, it compounds our tragedy,” Dabaja told CNN. “With each death, a fire inside of us continues to burn, and it burns stronger.”
With their sorrow comes anger and despair – and a sense that US leaders are not listening to their pleas for an end to the violence that has claimed the lives of so many loved ones.
“We don’t just need soft words and words of diplomacy,” Dabaja said. “We need action, we need change in policy, policy that says no to war, a policy that says no to foreign funding of wars.”
The US State Department confirmed to CNN on Friday that Jawad was a US citizen, not a legal permanent resident as spokesperson Matthew Miller initially said on Wednesday. Miller’s initial remarks disclaiming Jawad’s citizenship was criticized by the Arab American community and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which told CNN the rushed statements hurt the community and undermined the extent of Jawad’s loss.
“We are aware and alarmed of reports of the death of Kamel Jawad, who we have confirmed is a US citizen,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN, adding that they “are working to understand the circumstances of the incident.”
“As we have noted repeatedly, it is a moral and strategic imperative that Israel take all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm,” the spokesperson said. “Any loss of civilian life is a tragedy.”
‘Your duty is to the poor’
The Jawad family has denied all requests to speak to the media. In an Instagram exchange with a journalist, Nadine Jawad cited the “dehumanizing” coverage of Arabs and Arab Americans.
Jawad said in her statement on Facebook her father “never viewed himself as a savior,” only that he was “part of a much larger movement of people who refuse to stay silent in the face of oppression.”
He dedicated his life – and ultimately sacrificed it – for his beloved Lebanese community, in Lebanon and here in the US. But his American citizenship, his daughter says, does not make his life any more valuable than the lives of the thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes.
“His service and dedication to helping those in need is not over,” she wrote, vowing to continue his work.
Before he was killed, Jawad sent his children a simple voice note: “Peace be upon you. Everything is ok, but if something happens to me your duty is to the poor.”
The family has already launched a fundraiser in Jawad’s honor, collecting more than $88,000 to help feed and aid displaced Lebanese civilians through his nonprofit organization.
“Their death isn’t just a death, it isn’t just a loss, it is a message,” Dabaja said. “His story is a story that needs to be told to the whole world.”",['Alaa Elassar'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/12/middleeast/israel-military-push-northern-gaza-intl/index.html,"Gaza: After mulling siege plan, Israel ramps up military push in north of enclave",2024-10-12 09:31:23,"The Israeli military is carrying out a widespread operation in northern Gaza, issuing evacuation orders and blocking food supplies, just weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to be mulling a plan to besiege the area to starve Hamas and force it to release hostages.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) this week launched the operation following intelligence that it said showed “the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip, as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.” In practice, the renewed offensive has been far more widespread than the Jabalya refugee camp.
Four sources have told CNN that the Israeli cabinet has not adopted the siege proposal put forward by retired general Giora Eiland. But the operation currently underway bears resemblance to the plan presented by Eiland in a public video, and in private to the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.
A former senior military official who is aware of the Israeli government and security leadership’s thinking – though not directly involved in decision-making – told CNN that the cabinet had adopted “a version of” Eiland’s proposal, which has come to be known as “The General’s Plan.” Eiland told CNN the claim was “quite true” but said there were significant differences between his proposal and what was being implemented on the ground.
The operation comes at a time when the Israeli government is known to be considering several plans to reset the war in Gaza.
Eiland last month proposed forcing all civilians out of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, and then cutting off all supplies to the area. The goal, he said, was to force a reset in the war and upend Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s calculus. “The reality today in Gaza is that Sinwar is really not stressed,” he said in a video released at the time.
The former military official who spoke to CNN said that “what was adopted [by the government] was the need to do more in Gaza, to change the way Sinwar is thinking. It was adopted without any way that may be conceived a violation of international law.”
Eiland’s proposal had no plan to allow Gazan civilians to return to northern Gaza, Retired Major-General Gershon Hacohen, who was involved in its drafting, told CNN. That situation would seem certain to draw accusations of ethnic cleansing, something that has already been raised by academics like Omer Bartov, an Israeli-born professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University in Rhode Island.
Eiland told CNN by text message that the cabinet is “indeed acting on my recommendation with the intention of taking control of the northern Gaza Strip, but I recommended implementing a siege (after evacuating the civilians) and stopping the entry of supplies into this area. None of this is happening.”
On Monday, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson ordered all Palestinians in Gaza’s northern-most communities – Beit Hanoun, Jabalya, and Beit Lahia – to leave and relocate to Al Mawasi, an Israel-declared “humanitarian area” in southern Gaza that has nonetheless come under intense aerial bombardment for months.
The military on Saturday added additional mandatory evacuation zones, dropping flyers and posting on X, ordering people in the Nazla area and more areas of Jabalya to leave.
The military “is operating with great force against terrorist organizations and will continue to do so for an extended period,” Avichay Adraee said on X. “You must evacuate the area immediately via Salah al-Din Street to the humanitarian zone.”
Most intense action
Supplies of food into northern Gaza, already meager, appear to have almost entirely stopped since the Israeli military began its renewed operation there this week. The World Food Programme told CNN on Friday that no food trucks had entered northern Gaza since the start of the month.
“Virtually the entire area is under evacuation orders, and thousands of families have been forced to flee amid intense airstrikes and military operations on the ground,” WFP said in a statement on Wednesday. “With the main aid crossings into northern Gaza closed and WFP-partner kitchens forced to shut down, WFP is no longer able to distribute food in any form to families that desperately need it.”
CNN asked the IDF for comment on aid deliveries being blocked.
Netanyahu told a closed-door Knesset committee last month that the Generals’ Plan “makes a lot of sense,” according to national broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate. He said that it was one of several ideas being considered to change the course of the war in Gaza, which is now in its second year.
Palestinians in northern Gaza say that this week has brought some of the most intense military action of the war. Many, wary of repeated orders over the past year to move to areas of Gaza that then themselves come under attack, are ignoring the order. “Anyone who wants to leave the north to Gaza wants death,” Jabalya resident Mohammad Ibrahim told CNN by phone this week.
Palestinians fleeing the renewed operation have been shot at as they evacuate, according to residents there and footage shared with CNN documenting their journey. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
“Even the basic necessities of life for the besieged people are unavailable,” Ibrahim said. “There is no safe drinking water, no adequate or healthy food, no medicine, no treatment, and no hospitals. They are working at minimum capacity and are exhausted. Even the safe places are bombed with shells and rockets.”
Dr. Hussam Abu Saifiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said the facility was informed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Tuesday that medical staff and patients must evacuate the hospital “within 24 hours.” They were not told where to go, he said. Al Awda and the Indonesian hospitals have also been ordered to leave, according to local officials. Hospital officials say Israel’s intense bombardment of the area makes it impossible to leave safely.
Meanwhile, seven attempts this week by the World Health Organization to reach northern Gaza were “denied or impeded,” Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday.
“The team was unable to carry out the medical evacuation of critical patients from Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals to Al-Ahli and Al-Shifa, due to delays of over 10 hours at checkpoints,” he said in a statement on X.",['Mick Krever'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/12/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-border-clashes-casualties-intl-cmd/index.html,Israel’s last war against Hezbollah ended in stalemate. Fierce border clashes suggest a win won’t be easy,2024-10-08 00:00:00,"The Ziv hospital in northern Israel is on high alert. Non-urgent operations are on hold, staff have been asked to consider donating blood when needed, and all patients – including newborns in the maternity unit – have been moved underground.
The expectation here is clear: If Israel ends up sending more troops to southern Lebanon, it could get bloody.
“We have been in a war situation for the past year, but after the army entered into Lebanon, our services and all of the staff are ready for, unfortunately, the next wave of casualties,” the hospital’s director, Salman Zarka, told CNN.
Ziv Medical Center is the only hospital in the area and the closest to Israel’s borders with Lebanon and Syria, as well as the occupied Golan Heights. The hospital in Safed has been receiving people injured in cross-border fire for months, including children hurt in the deadly attack on Majdal Shams in July.
“When you have combat on the ground, usually you have more wounded and, unfortunately, dead soldiers. I hope it will not happen, (but) we have to be ready,” Zarka, an IDF reservist and a former commander of the IDF’s Medical Services Center, added.
When the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a ground operation against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon last week, its commanders insisted any action across the border would be “limited” in both geographical scope and duration. But the reality on the ground indicates it might be preparing for the possibility of a much bigger war.
The IDF said on Tuesday that units from four divisions are now fighting in southern Lebanon. The force doesn’t disclose its troop numbers, but each division is thought to consist of some 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers. Israel has also broadened evacuation orders to roughly a quarter of Lebanese territory, with more than 1.2 million people now displaced, according to the United Nations.
Daniel Sobelman, an international security expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said the IDF has remained intentionally vague about the scope of the operation.
“Initially, Israel said this is just to make sure that all the (Hezbollah) infrastructure on the other side of the fence is destroyed,” he said.
“But the thing that we all know is that this infrastructure doesn’t stop a few hundreds of meters or even a few kilometers in, it stretches out all the way to Beirut, into northern Lebanon, into the Beqaa Valley. If Israel really wants to clean up that area, then we would be looking at a very long-term operation,” he said.
The idea of a major ground invasion causes concern on both sides of the border, where memories of the last war remain raw. The 2006 conflict is known in Israel as the “Second Lebanon War” even though it was the third time Israel publicly said it entered Lebanon’s territory, after invading it in 1978 and 1982. The war ended in a stalemate after 34 days, after some 1,100 Lebanese and about 170 Israelis, including 120 soldiers, were killed.
For the Lebanese, the current conflict is already bloodier than the last war. More than 1,500 people have been killed in the country since September 16, when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of Lebanese health ministry statements.
Several international organizations have criticized Israel for the escalation. The UN said last month that “while Hezbollah has fired more missiles indiscriminately, forcing thousands of Israelis to leave their homes, Israel has escalated its indiscriminate and large-scale airstrikes across Lebanon,” warning that the increased violence “adds to the instability.”
And while the casualties on the Israeli side are much lower and mostly limited to military, they are not insignificant: At least 14 IDF soldiers have been killed. Zarka told CNN there has also been a steady stream of injured soldiers coming to the hospital since the ground operation started – the hospital received well over 100 in just the first few days, he said.
Both the IDF and Hezbollah said there had been fierce clashes and several cross-border attacks in the past week.
The level of resistance from Hezbollah has surprised many observers given that Israel has recently killed nearly the entire leadership of the Iran-backed group, including its long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah.
At the same time, Hezbollah continues to fire rockets into Israel on a regular basis. And while most of the projectiles are intercepted by Israeli air defense systems, some slip through. On Wednesday, two Israeli civilians were killed when a rocket struck Kiryat Shmona, a town a few miles away from the border.
Several Israeli soldiers who are currently fighting in Lebanon told CNN the open, mountainous terrain where their enemy is at home makes the operation difficult.
One soldier, who was deployed to Gaza from October to March and in July and August and who is now fighting in southern Lebanon, said the war along the northern border is very different to what he experienced in Gaza.
“The challenge is not that Hezbollah is more equipped by Iran or have more training. The challenge is the switch in the head from months of fighting in an urban territory versus fighting in an open area territory,” he said, adding that even the most basic maneuvers – including the way soldiers move around in a column – are completely different.
Since IDF troops are not allowed to speak to the media without official permission, CNN is not publishing the name of the soldier.
Guerilla warfare
On paper, Israel’s army is far superior to Hezbollah’s militia fighters. It has more advanced and sophisticated weapons, a significantly higher number of troops, better intelligence and stronger allies.
But the soldier who spoke with CNN said these advantages don’t count for much in the type of fighting that is going on in the hills of southern Lebanon, where superior weaponry counts for less.
Sobelman, the security expert, said Israel had a similar experience in the 2006 war with Hezbollah.
“Hezbollah were up against the strongest military in the Middle East, there were literally hundreds of Israeli air raids per day, and artillery, and all the capabilities that a modern, advanced military has to offer. And they were not defeated. They survived. And throughout the entire Israeli offensive, Hezbollah was able to fire hundreds of rockets into Israel every day,” he said.
Sobelman said that after the 2006 fiasco, Israel had spent almost two decades preparing for its next confrontation with Hezbollah.
“The assumption has been that the next war is going to be with Hezbollah, not Hamas. No one on Earth probably imagined a scenario along the lines of October 7. Instead, Israel invested almost two decades preparing itself for what we’ve seen over the past several weeks – and in terms of Israel’s intelligence penetration of Hezbollah, it’s astounding.”
But while Israel has managed to kill several of Hezbollah’s top figures and inflicted much damage on the group’s rank-and-file members using exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, as well as airstrikes that have also claimed civilian lives, the IDF continues to face fierce resistance in southern Lebanon.
Because Hezbollah has been preparing for this war as well.
“The expectation is that Israel will win this war without paying too high a price. But that’s never the case with guerilla warfare,” Sobelman said, adding that Israel is fighting on a territory that Hezbollah knows much better and that its opponent is determined to inflict as many losses on the IDF as possible.
“They’re entrenched in underground facilities and they’re playing a defensive game,” he said of Hezbollah’s fighters. “And it doesn’t matter how many of them you kill, still (in a guerilla war) the weaker side ultimately wins by imposing a sustained accumulation of costs.”
He said this is exactly what happened in 2006, when Israel was not able to achieve a decisive victory despite its superior capabilities.
While the IDF has not provided any details about how its troops died in Lebanon, Hezbollah has claimed to have successfully ambushed Israeli soldiers on several occasions, saying it killed and injured a number of them.
‘Bring it on’
Despite the challenges, the IDF seems determined to push on. Speaking on Wednesday, IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi said Israel would “strike Hezbollah with intensity, without allowing them any respite or recovery.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went as far as warning the Lebanese people that they face falling “into the abyss of a long war” because of Hezbollah.
Israeli soldiers on the ground seem prepared for a long war. “I wish we didn’t have to expand the scope of the ground incursion… but if we have to fight so that the children can go to kindergarten and not be afraid of a missile strike, we will do that too,” the soldier who spoke with CNN said, adding that he and his fellow fighters were “stronger than ever, ready and determined.”
This sentiment seemed prevalent among the dozens of Israeli soldiers CNN encountered while reporting from around the border after the IDF announced the ground operation. Most troops appeared in high spirits in the days after the ground operation began. When asked about Hezbollah specifically, one group responded by calling out “Bring it on!”
But some in Israeli society are not so sure going into Lebanon is a good idea. Several civilians living in the northern parts of Israel told CNN last week that they fear a ground war could become very deadly.
And some, like Itamar Greenberg, are prepared to go to prison in protest against the war. The 18-year-old is a conscientious objector, or “refusenik.”
Conscription is mandatory for most Israeli citizens, men and women, and only a few young people dare to refuse on moral basis. A handful end up in prison each year.
Greenberg has spent 60 days in prison so far – 30 days after his initial draft rejection and 30 days after he was called up a second time and refused again. CNN spoke to him in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, four days before he was scheduled to go back to prison after refusing to enlist for the third time.
Before the IDF attempted to draft him, Greenberg was an activist campaigning against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and against increasingly violent attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages. Some of these protests turned violent after Israeli security authorities got involved – clearly leaving a mark on Greenberg. When a police car drove past, its sirens on, he flinched and looked around with worry.
Greenberg told CNN he had refused to enlist in the army in protest of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, its war in Gaza and, most recently, its operation in Lebanon. “The war in Lebanon started when I was in jail. I joked that I didn’t even have the time to refuse all their f**king wars,” he noted.
He was born in 2006, the year of the Second Lebanon War – a coincidence that is not lost on him. “The first (Israeli) soldiers have now been killed in the Third Lebanon War and the children who will fight in the Fourth Lebanon War are being born now,” he said.
“This war is creating the next war. The children that see their family die will not stop. I am pretty sure, based on the history, they will choose resistance and violence. It’s sad, but it’s the reality.”",['Ivana Kottasová'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/politics/iran-nervous-israel-response-missile-attacks/index.html,Iran engages in urgent diplomacy as it braces for Israel’s response to missile attacks,2024-10-11 18:47:04,"Iran’s government is extremely nervous and has been engaging in urgent diplomatic efforts with countries in the Middle East to gauge whether they can reduce the scale of Israel’s response to its missile attack earlier this month and – if that fails – help protect Tehran, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
Iran’s anxiety stems from uncertainty about whether the US can convince Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites and oil facilities, and the fact that its most important proxy militia in the region, Hezbollah, has been significantly weakened by Israeli military operations in recent weeks, the sources said.
The US has been consulting with Israel on how it plans to respond to Iran’s October 1 attack, and US officials have made clear they do not want Israel to target Iranian nuclear sites or oil fields. US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months, telling him Israel’s retaliation should be “proportional.”
The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, have also expressed concern to the US about a potential attack on Iranian oil facilities, which could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN.
The Biden administration is deeply worried that the ongoing tit-for-tat attacks between Iran and Israel, which began earlier this year after Israel struck what Iran said was its consulate building in Damascus, could spiral into a major regional war that pulls the US in, too.
A major part of the fears is that the US’ influence with Israel has appeared to be steadily waning over the last year. Similarly to its operations in Gaza, Israel has increasingly disregarded the US’ calls for more restraint in Lebanon, where Israel’s intense bombing campaign and ground offensive has killed over 1,400 people since late last month.
Israel also did not consult with the US before conducting a massive attack that exploded thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah operatives last month, or before assassinating Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and upending a delicate ceasefire proposal that had been put forward by the US and France less than 48 hours earlier.
Israel’s security cabinet has not yet reached a decision on how to proceed, an Israeli official told CNN on Friday. And while the gap between the US and Israeli positions is narrowing, it may not remain that way, a US official said.
“We can’t actually know whether they voted or not,” a senior administration official said of the Israeli cabinet’s discussions, expressing skepticism over the level of transparency about what Israel is sharing with the US. The official suggested they can’t “put too much stock in the machinations” of the Israeli government.
As of last week, Israel had not given any assurances that it would not target Iran’s nuclear facilities, CNN reported.
Israel has for decades been planning attacks on Iran’s nuclear capabilities, and just two years ago simulated striking them in a military exercise. Israel is also suspected of carrying out assassinations against Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years, and Iran’s nuclear facilities have come under siege from cyberattacks, likely from Israel—the most famous being the Stuxnet virus, which was able to penetrate Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility.
‘Our strike will be powerful’
Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a strong warning to Iran about his country’s response on Wednesday.
“Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,” Gallant said.
The Gulf states, broadly, are eager to stay on the sidelines of the conflict, the Arab diplomat said. While Iran has publicly warned that any parties seen as aiding Israel will be treated as aggressors, it is also unlikely that Iran’s neighbors would explicitly come to Tehran’s defense in the event of an Israeli attack.
But Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have told both the US and Iran that they will not allow Israel to use their airspace to strike Iran, the Arab diplomat and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. Jordan also will protect its airspace from any unauthorized intrusion, regardless of the origin, a Jordanian official said.
The US does not believe that Iran wants to become entangled in a full-scale war with Israel, and Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera this week that Netanyahu “is the only one who wants a war and to set the region on fire to stay in power.”
But the US has still urged Tehran, through backchannels, to calibrate its response if Israel attacks, an official said.
While Qatar regularly speaks to the Iranians and relays back to the US what they say, the US official said that ultimately “we just do not know what [Iran] will do.” Key voices within Iran will have different ideas about if and how to respond to Israel, but that will depend on the scale and scope of the highly anticipated Israeli move, another US official said.
This official said that messaging from Iran has been consistent both publicly and privately since Tehran launched its barrage of missiles at Israel earlier this month and there has not been a significant change in messaging.
Iran has been particularly interested in getting help from Saudi Arabia in preventing an Israeli attack and using their influence with Washington to help find a solution to the crisis, the Arab diplomat told CNN.
Officials from each country have met three times in less than a month, and Araghchi traveled to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to “consult on regional developments” and to “try to stop the crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon and Gaza,” he told local media.
The world is watching Israel’s every move as it contemplates how to respond. But at least until Saturday at sundown, Israel will be at a standstill to mark Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement and the holiest day of the year in Judaism. And though it’s not impossible Israel might launch action, shops, restaurants and other services will be closed, public transport will not be operating and even the country’s main airport — the Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv — will be shut down.

In August, approximately 700 hundred aid trucks entered northern Gaza. In September, only 400 aid trucks entered, after commercial operations ceased at the Allenby Crossing on the border between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, the WFP added. No food trucks have entered northern Gaza in October, the WFP told CNN.
On Wednesday, the WFP said in a report that the aid entering the strip has plummeted to its lowest level in months, forcing the organization to stop the distribution of food parcels in October.
“Hunger remains rampant and the threat of famine persists,” WFP added. “If the flow of assistance does not resume, one million vulnerable people will be deprived on this lifeline.”
Meanwhile, two of central Gaza’s main bakeries have been shut down for three days, according to CNN footage and bakery workers.
Al-Banna Bakery and Zadna Bakery in Deir al-Balah, both supported by the WFP, have halted operations due to a lack of flour and fuel, bakery workers and residents told CNN.
“I am the head of a family of six. The day I work, I can feed my family. The day I don’t, we don’t eat,” said Ahmad Abed, an employee at Al-Banna Bakery. “People are chasing flour, and we go to bakeries searching for where bread is available.”
Amjad Al-Shawa, Director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network, told CNN that the depletion of flour and other production materials has led to the closure of essential bakeries that produce bread as part of humanitarian aid.
“Most of our people have come to rely on this aid. Now, they are at risk of hunger and famine,” Al-Shawa added.
Bread remains the number one staple food for Palestinians and has become a crucial basic necessity since the war started just over a year ago.
Earlier this week, the UN’s OCHA said: “September saw the lowest volume of commercial and humanitarian supplies entering Gaza since at least March 2024.”
Israel’s military launched a new ground operation in northern Gaza on October 6, after seeing signs of Hamas rebuilding.
The military has issued fresh evacuation orders for residents in northern Gaza, adding it had expanded the scope of the “humanitarian area” in Al-Mawasi in the south. But some residents have told CNN they are wary of attempting to leave besieged parts of northern Gaza, citing numerous Israeli attacks targeting Hamas militants in Israeli-designated “safe zones.”

Israel’s actions in the besieged Palestinian enclave “constitute the war crimes of willful killing and mistreatment and the crime against humanity of extermination,” the commission said in a statement Thursday.
“Israeli security forces have deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles” in Gaza, according to the report by the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.
The Israeli attacks resulted in “fuel, food, water, medicines and medical supplies not reaching hospitals, while also drastically reducing permits for patients to leave the territory for medical treatment,” it said.
The Israeli foreign ministry called the accusations “outrageous” and said they were “another blatant attempt by the (commission) to delegitimize the very existence of the State of Israel and obstruct its right to protect its population while covering up the crimes of terrorist organizations.”
“This report shamelessly portrays Israel’s operations in terror-infested health facilities in Gaza as a matter of policy against Gaza’s health system, while entirely dismissing overwhelming evidence that medical facilities in Gaza have been systematically used by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad for terrorist activities.”
Hamas, it said, uses medical facilities to conceal operatives, store weapons, conduct attacks and hide hostages. Hamas has repeatedly denied that it uses hospitals for military activity.
The UN report also accused Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups of committing war crimes of “torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, rape and sexual violence” for their treatment of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza. It also investigated “institutionalized mistreatment” of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.
The Israeli foreign ministry rejected “accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees,” saying Israel is “fully committed to international legal standards” on treatment of detainees.
In a statement accompanying the 24-page report, which does not have the force of law, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Israel “must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction” in Gaza.
“Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system,” she said.
As part of the report, UN experts investigated the killing of 5-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, who made headlines in late January after a recording emerged of her pleading to emergency workers to rescue her and her family after they became trapped in their car due to Israeli shelling.
Despite an ambulance arriving at the scene while the girl was still alive, the presence of Israeli security forces effectively “prevented access,” meaning the bodies of Rajab’s relatives “could not be retrieved from their bullet-ridden car until 12 days after the incident,” the report said.
The report “determined on reasonable grounds that the Israeli Army’s 162nd Division” which operated in the area at the time is “responsible for killing the family of seven, shelling the ambulance and killing the two paramedics inside.”
The incident was just one of several alleged attacks on health care in Gaza, amid broader wartime conditions.
The report will be presented to the UN General Assembly on October 30.","['Niamh Kennedy', 'Muhammad Darwish']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/middleeast/un-peacekeepers-lebanon-lacroix-intl-latam/index.html,"Peacekeepers’ safety in Lebanon ‘in jeopardy,’ UN official warns after Israeli fire injures two",2024-10-11 05:24:35,"Concerns are mounting for the safety of United Nations peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon amid Israel’s ground incursion, UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix warned on Thursday, after Israeli fire resulted in the injury of two UN troops.
Briefing the UN Security Council on Thursday, UN Under-Secretary General for Peace Operations Lacroix described hostilities between Israeli forces and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon as “increasingly alarming,” and putting “peacekeepers at serious risk.”
“The safety and security of peacekeepers is now increasingly in jeopardy,” Lacroix said.
The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reported early Thursday that the peacekeepers were injured after an Israeli tank fired toward an observation tower at its headquarters in the southern Lebanese city Naqoura.
The Israeli tank fire directly hit the tower, causing the peacekeepers to fall, UNIFIL said, adding that other “nearby positions have been repeatedly hit.”
UNFIL said that “any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have accused Hezbollah of operating in areas near UNIFIL posts, and said in a statement that it had asked UNIFIL forces to “remain in protected spaces” during the incident.
“The IDF is operating in southern Lebanon and maintains routine communication with UNIFIL,” the IDF said in a statement after Thursday’s incident.
“This morning (Thursday), IDF troops operated in the area of Naqoura, next to a UNIFIL base. Accordingly, the IDF instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, following which the forces opened fire in the area,” the statement added.
UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said the two peacekeepers – both Indonesian – were hospitalized. Their injuries are not serious, he said.
UN peacekeepers have been stationed in southern Lebanon since 2006, per a mandate by the United Nations Security Council. UN peacekeepers were drawn from armies of several nations to monitor the situation along the roughly 120-kilometer (74-mile) Blue Line which separates the two states.
The incident came as Israel expands its strikes across Lebanon. On Thursday, Israeli strikes on a densely populated Beirut neighborhood killed at least 22 people and wounded 117, the Lebanese health ministry said.
A senior Hezbollah official was the target of the attack, according to a source in the militant group and Israeli media reports. Wafiq Safa, leader of Hezbollah’s liaison unit, survived the assassination attempt, the Hezbollah source told CNN. Israel has not publicly claimed Thursday’s strikes or confirmed any targets.
International outcry
The injury of the UN peacekeepers drew condemnation from several countries including Italy, France, and Ireland, who all have contingents in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.
Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni summoned the Israeli ambassador in Rome on Thursday after what she described as “unacceptable” behavior by the Israeli forces.
Meloni’s office said two Italian bases of UNIFIL were “hit by gunfire from the Israeli army” on Thursday and added that the prime minister spoke to the Commander of the Western Sector of the UNIFIL mission, Gen. Stefano Messina, for an update on the safety of the Italian troops.
The Italian leader also contacted Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to “firmly remind” him that “what is happening near the Italian UNIFIL bases in southern Lebanon” is “unacceptable,” according to an Italian government statement.
Indonesia’s mission to the UN blasted Israel over what it called “deliberate attacks,” saying Friday that Israel’s actions “represent a blatant attempt to spread terror on the ground to intimidate both the peacekeeping mission and international community.”
France also expressed “deep concern” after the attack, saying it was “awaiting explanations from the Israeli authorities.”
“The protection of peacekeepers is an obligation imposed on all parties to a conflict. France calls on the parties to respect this obligation, and to allow UNIFIL to continue to implement its mandate, including by respecting its freedom of movement,” a spokesperson for the French foreign ministry said.
Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin described the IDF’s “targeting & firing on UNIFIL positions” as “reprehensible” and “unacceptable.”
Earlier this week, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris also expressed concern after Israeli tanks were stationed close to an UN outpost manned by Irish peacekeepers.
The European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell condemned what he called an “inadmissible act,” posting to X: “Another line has been dangerously crossed in Lebanon: IDF shelling of UN peacekeepers whose positions are known. We condemn this inadmissible act, for which there is no justification.”
The EU foreign policy chief reiterated his support for UNIFIL and called for full accountability regarding the incident.","['Niamh Kennedy', 'Saskya Vandoorne', 'Lauren Izso', 'Mostafa Salem']",en

The attack on the Rafidah school injured at least 54 Palestinians, according to the Red Crescent. Hospital officials have confirmed the death toll.
The Israeli military said it struck “terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center” at the school compound, saying “numerous steps” were taken to protect civilians. CNN cannot independently verify the claim.
CNN footage showed children being carried into ambulances, their faces covered with blood, and many of them screaming and crying. One girl lay on the hospital floor, wearing only underpants, shaking and covered in blood, with severe burns on her body.
“Am I going to die?” the girl asked medical workers at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. “What happened?”
The strike tore down the walls of the school, covering its rooms with blackened debris. Responders and survivors dug through the wreckage trying to recover bodies.
Ayman Abou Khousa, a displaced Palestinian who was sheltering at the school, said the attack came “by surprise,” and he is now still looking for his relatives under the rubble.
“We are dying every day,” he told CNN. “The world has sold us out… every day you (journalists) come here and film us. You’ve been filming us for a year,” Khousa said, adding that Gazans are still forced to dig for their dead with their bare hands.
Another man working to recover bodies said that survivors are looking for their relatives “in pieces,” as the attack scattered their remains. Footage from the site showed some of those killed being moved in pieces, with limbs gathered in bedsheets and blankets by survivors.
“Why are they hitting the school? It is all displaced people, mostly women,” Iftekhar Hammouda, another woman who was sheltering at the school, said, adding that “there is no Hamas” there.
“Where can people go? Where do they flee? They hit us at our homes, at our tents, on the streets and at the schools,” Hammouda added.
Thursday’s strike is the latest to hit a school in Gaza. Last month, an Israeli strike on a school compound near Gaza city, killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian officials. Israel said it targeted Hamas fighters sheltering there.
In August, local officials said that more than 90 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school and mosque in Al-Tabi’in compound in the Al-Daraj neighborhood in the eastern part of Gaza City, where displaced people were sheltering. Israel confirmed it carried out the strike, saying it had targeted a Hamas command post and killed several fighters.
Israel has renewed its military operation in some parts of Gaza, saying it is targeting attempts by Hamas to regroup, and has ordered mass evacuations of multiple neighborhoods across the enclave.
The latest strike comes as Gaza’s health ministry reported more than 42,000 people killed in the besieged territory since the war began a year ago following the Hamas attacks of October 7, and as Israel presses on with a ground incursion into Lebanon while weighing an attack on Iran.","['Ibrahim Dahman', 'Abeer Salman', 'Sana Noor Haq']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/09/travel/air-france-iraq-iran-israel-missile-intl/index.html,Air France says jet flew over Iraq as Iranian missiles descended on Israel,2024-10-09 16:14:57,"Air France has opened an investigation into how a jet flying from Paris to Dubai went over Iraq as Iranian missiles fired at Israel crossed the same airspace, the airline said Wednesday.
Iran launched dozens of missiles towards Israel on October 1 in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others in Lebanon. The missiles had to pass through Iraq’s airspace to reach Israel.
Air France Flight AF662 was flying over Iraq when the Iranian attack began at around 4:45 p.m. UTC (11.45 a.m. ET) and left Iraqi airspace “shortly before” 5 p.m. UTC (12 p.m. ET), the airline told CNN in a statement.
Iraqi airspace was not officially closed by local authorities until 5:56 p.m. UTC (12:56 p.m. ET), it added.
“Thanks to the information we gathered we were able to identify a forthcoming attack on Israel by Iran, involving the launch of ballistic missiles,” Air France said.
“As a result, and without waiting for instructions from the Iraqi authorities, Air France decided to suspend the overflight of the country’s airspace by its aircraft from 5 p.m. UTC [12 p.m. ET],” it added.
The airline said its jets “were already avoiding Israeli, Lebanese and Iranian airspace,” and that Flight AF662 was flying through “a special corridor used by all airlines.”
Some hours before the strike, the White House said it had “indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.”
Air France stressed that a number of its other flights had been diverted to avoid the region on the night of the attack.
“Air France constantly monitors geopolitical developments in the areas it serves and flies over, to ensure the highest levels of flight safety and security,” it said, adding “the safety of its customers and crews is its top priority.”
French television channel LCI, which first reported the incident, said Air France pilots saw the missiles in the night sky from the cockpit, and that Iraqi air traffic control had wished the pilots “good luck.”
Asked by CNN, an Air France spokesperson would not confirm that the pilots saw missiles fly past.
The incident comes as the conflict in the Middle East further spirals. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned the Lebanese people they face falling “into the abyss of a long war” as his country escalates its attacks on Hezbollah, which is continuing to fire rockets into northern Israel.
The Israeli cabinet is also considering how to respond to Iran’s October 1 strike, after pledging Tehran “will pay” for launching its largest-ever attack on Israel.","['Christian Edwards', 'Saskya Vandoorne']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/middleeast/hezbollah-endorses-lebanon-ceasefire-first-time-israel-war-intl/index.html,Hezbollah publicly endorses Lebanon ceasefire efforts for the first time as Israel ramps up offensive,2024-10-08 00:00:00,"Hezbollah supports efforts aimed at achieving a ceasefire in Lebanon, its top official said on Tuesday, marking the first time the group has publicly endorsed a truce and not conditioned it on stopping the war in Gaza.
“We support the political efforts led by (Parliament Speaker Nabih) Berri under the banner of achieving a ceasefire. Once the ceasefire is firmly established and diplomacy can reach it, all other details will be discussed and decisions will be made collaboratively,” Deputy Secretery General Naim Qassem said.
Lebanon’s Hezbollah began firing at Israel on October 8 last year to show solidarity with Hamas, which had launched an attack on Israel from Gaza a day earlier. Hezbollah had previously stated that it would only cease its attacks on Israel once a ceasefire was reached with Hamas in Gaza. Israel, however, insisted that Hezbollah separate its conflict with Israel from the ongoing war with Hamas.
In his speech marking the first anniversary of Hezbollah’s involvement in the war, Qassem did not mention a Gaza ceasefire as a condition for achieving one in Lebanon. It was Qassem’s second speech since Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah late last month. Israel has since been conducting limited ground incursions into southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, which has continued to fire rockets into northern Israel.
Nabih Berri, the leader of the Shiite Amal party that is allied with Hezbollah, has been a key figure in negotiations for a ceasefire mediated by Western nations.
Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN last week that Nasrallah had agreed to a temporary ceasefire that was called for by US President Joe Biden, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and other allies during last month’s UN General Assembly. Soon after, Nasrallah was assassinated by Israel.
US officials have told CNN that the Biden administration isn’t actively trying to revive the deal and has resigned itself to trying to shape and limit Israeli operations in Lebanon and against Iran rather than halting hostilities.
Tzipi Hotovely, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, said in an interview with Sky News on Sunday that Nasrallah hadn’t agreed to a ceasefire and called Bou Habib’s claim “ridiculous.”
‘Abyss of a long war’
In a video message on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has “eliminated” Hashem Safieddine, the successor to Nasrallah. However, the Israeli military said it is still checking whether a strike on Hezbollah intelligence headquarters in Beirut killed him.
Netanyahu addressed the people of Lebanon directly in the message, urging them to stand up to Hezbollah and “take back your country,” and threatening them with a Gaza style war if they do not.
“Christians, Druze, Muslims – Sunnis and Shiites alike – all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah’s futile war in Israel,” Netanyahu said. “You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will bring destruction and suffering similar to what we see in Gaza,” he continued.
Israel’s war on Hezbollah has killed more than 1,400 people in Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month, Lebanese authorities have said.
Despite the nod to ceasefire talks, much of Qassem’s speech on Tuesday carried a defiant tone, emphasizing Hezbollah’s readiness and capability to continue its fight against Israel.
“If the enemy continues its war, then the battlefield will be decisive, and the battlefield belongs to us” he said.
Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched a large barrage of rockets toward the Israeli cities of Haifa and Kiryat, one of the largest on the city since the start of the war. The rockets were fired from Lebanon in two separate barrages, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. While numerous rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the military, at least two buildings in Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin were directly hit, it said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Israel’s military said it had expanded its “limited, localized, targeted operations” into southwestern Lebanon.",['Abbas Al Lawati'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/politics/trump-gaza-fact-check/index.html,Fact check: No evidence for Trump’s claim he has been to Gaza,2024-10-08 16:51:17,"After Donald Trump was asked in a Monday interview about the future prospects of Gaza, the former president made a curious claim: “You know, I’ve been there, and it’s rough.”
There is no public evidence of Trump ever having been to Gaza, which has been governed by militant group Hamas since 2007. He certainly didn’t go to Gaza as president, and CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post have all found no proof he made a prior visit.
Perhaps he merely meant he has been to Palestinian territory, since he did visit the West Bank in 2017? Or maybe he was just talking about having been to the broader region?
Nope.
Trump’s campaign said Monday night that he meant what he said about having been to Gaza in particular – and the campaign insisted the claim is true.
“President Trump has been to Gaza previously and has always worked to ensure peace in the Middle East,” campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CNN.
Leavitt, though, did not provide a single detail about Trump’s supposed trip to Gaza. And she did not respond when we repeatedly asked for even the most basic information, like the year of the supposed visit.
So we were highly skeptical – because Trump has a long history of making things up, because of the lack of public evidence, because the Times of Israel has reported that Trump had never even visited Israel before his presidency, and because the Trump campaign had offered a substantively different comment to The New York Times earlier Monday.
That earlier comment, which a campaign official provided only on condition of anonymity, did not say Trump had actually been to Gaza. Instead, the anonymous campaign official tried some spin, correctly saying that Trump has been to Israel but wrongly saying, “Gaza is in Israel.”
We asked three former Trump officials who worked on Middle East policy whether they know of any proof for the former president’s claim, and the campaign’s claim to CNN, that Trump has been to Gaza itself. The only one who has responded, Trump-appointed former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker, said in an email: “As far as I know, he’s never traveled there. He did not go in 2017 when he visited Israel. I think this story is probably already over.”
Another wild goose chase
For years, Trump’s uncorroborated stories have sent us on fact-check wild goose chases – seeking everything from proof that he was years ago named “Man of the Year” in Michigan (he wasn’t) to proof that something terrible related to immigration had happened “last night in Sweden” in 2017 (nothing had happened).
This new hunt was equally fruitless.
Trump aides told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday that the former president privately said he did indeed to go to Gaza and that his comment in the Monday interview was not a mistake. But those aides were unable to provide any details about his alleged trip, including when he traveled, why he went or who he was with.
David Friedman, who served as Trump’s ambassador to Israel, and Jason Greenblatt, a former Trump Organization executive who became Trump’s special representative for international negotiations, did not immediately respond Tuesday to our requests for comment.
And since we were determined to give Trump associates and supporters every possible opportunity to substantiate the claim, we also took the rare step late Monday night of putting out a public request on X for any corroborating information.
As of noon on Tuesday, nobody had replied with any.

Mohammad Sultan, 28, said he and his family fled their house in Jabalya in northern Gaza “due to the intense and continuous bombardments in the area.” When he went back to retrieve food, water and blankets, he and other civilians were fired at, he said.
“Drones were firing at everyone passing by on the road,” Sultan told CNN. “Three people were shot right in front of me. My brother and I tried to help the injured get to the hospitals, but a little girl was shot in the neck, and her father was also injured.”
The shooting took place at Abu Sharkh roundabout in Jabalya, according to Sultan. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
Footage taken by Sultan during his journey shows residents walking along a sandy road, surrounded by rubble and half-destroyed buildings. Some, including children, are on foot, struggling to walk with heavy bags. Others are on bicycles or tuk-tuks.
Drones can be heard buzzing in the background as the bullwhip-like sound of bullets piercing the air trigger screams and attempts to shelter.
“They are hit, they are hit,” Sultan is heard shouting as he films civilians from a distance. An injured man, bleeding, limps toward him. Another girl is seen sitting in an ambulance, her neck wrapped in blood-soaked gauze that is seeping through the bandage. Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City later identified her as 9-year-old Dana Nasser, and told CNN she must be admitted to surgery. Her father was shot in the leg, the hospital said.
The Israeli military on Monday issued fresh evacuation orders in both northern and southern Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been sheltering. In northern Gaza, the military said it is “currently operating with great force in the area” and told residents to move to Al Mawasi, a southern region designated as a so-called humanitarian zone that is already crammed with refugees.
A day earlier, Israel’s military said it had encircled Jabalya as it launched a new ground operation there amid efforts by Hamas to “rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.”
Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said on Monday it was engaged in “fierce fights” with Israeli forces in northern Gaza.
Flyers were dropped by the Israeli military over Jabalya Tuesday morning, “urgently” warning residents to “evacuate immediately,” residents told CNN.
The renewed fighting comes on the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
Gunfire at ‘anything that moves’
Hassan Hamad, a resident of Jabalya, was killed this week in his home in Jabalya, his aunt Itaf told CNN. She decided to stay in the city to collect his remains and give him a dignified burial. After months of documenting Israel’s offensive in Jabalya,18-year-old Hamad was killed when his family’s apartment was hit in an Israeli missile attack in the city’s refugee camp on Sunday, according to witness testimony and footage shared with CNN.
Gunfire and shelling have stopped his aunt from leaving the house in search of her nephew’s remains, which were scattered around the area after the assault, she told CNN.
“We stayed in the house to search for the remaining body parts of Hassan, but now we cannot go out due to the intensity of the shelling and gunfire,” the 58-year-old said, adding the gunfire targets “anything that moves.”
Itaf spoke to CNN on the phone from her home in Jabalya, where shelling could be heard in the background.
“We try to stay away from the windows, so they won’t shoot at us,” she said.
Residents say the fighting in Jabalya has been some of the most intense in recent days.
Mohammad Ibrahim, a resident of the city who decided to stay in his home with his two sons, said the explosions outside his house were so intense they “shook” his body.
“I felt as though my body was tearing apart,” Ibrahim told CNN, adding that the firing is more intense than it was at the outset of the war.
From his window, Ibrahim said he could see smoke billowing between abandoned apartment buildings. “Anyone who wants to leave the north to Gaza wants death,” he said.
Jabalya has been targeted several times during the war, and like many other parts of Gaza, its residents say they don’t know where to go for shelter.
“We are living in the Stone Age,” Ibrahim said. “There is no conscience, no humanity, no human rights.”",['Nadeen Ebrahim'],en

On Monday, as Israel marked a year since Hamas’ October 7 attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “continue to fight” and achieve the country’s war goals, including toppling Hamas and “eliminating any future threat from Gaza to Israel.”
The same day, the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders in both northern and southern Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been sheltering.
In northern Gaza, the military said it is “currently operating with great force in the area” and told residents to move to Al Mawasi, a southern region designated as a so-called humanitarian zone that is already crammed with refugees.
A new military ground operation was launched on Sunday in Jabalya, northern Gaza, where the military said it is encircling the area after it saw signs of Hamas rebuilding. Earlier this year, Israel’s military said it had defeated Hamas in northern Gaza, only to announce new operations there in May.
Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters are engaged “in fierce clashes at zero distance with the enemy forces” in Jabalya, an indication the group has maintained a presence there to keep fighting.
Casualties in the north have also mounted in recent days. Ahead of the Israeli military announcements Monday, hospitals said they had received five bodies and several injured people following Israeli “artillery fire” in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.
Hours later, Kamal Adwan hospital said at least 10 people were killed, and 20 injured, in an Israeli airstrike on Jabalya. Footage from the scene showed multiple bodies lying in the street covered in blood. The strike happened about three hours after the Israeli military issued the evacuation order.
About an hour after the first evacuation order, the military issued another directive to leave parts of southern Gaza near Khan Younis. The military said it was responding with “extreme force” to Hamas actions in the area and also called on Palestinians to evacuate to Al Mawasi.
Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians are already sheltering in Al Mawasi after fleeing Israel’s bombardment in other parts of Gaza. The new evacuation orders mean more people will be displaced yet again, and crammed into a very small area — worsening an already critical humanitarian situation.
Lena, a worker for non-profit organization Mercy Corps, told CNN she had been displaced more than a dozen times since last year. CNN is not using her real name due to concerns for her safety.
“We haven’t put our clothes in wardrobes, bathed comfortably, had a meal with any sense of peace, slept on a proper bed, or had clean drinking water in over a year,” said Lena, who now lives in a shelter in central Gaza.
The Israel military said it intercepted five projectiles launched from northern Gaza on Monday. Earlier in the day, nine projectiles were launched from southern Gaza, injuring two people, the military said.",['Irene Nasser'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/middleeast/israel-anniversary-october-7-hamas-attacks-intl-latam/index.html,Israel marks the anniversary of October 7 Hamas attacks with tears and anger,2024-10-08 00:16:41,"It was 6:29 a.m. when the blasting music stopped without warning. The brief silence that followed was pierced by the screams of a woman somewhere in the crowd in this remote site in the Negev Desert.
The woman and hundreds of others were reliving in real time the moment terrorists stormed the Nova Music Festival in southern Israel, marking the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks in which Hamas and other militant groups killed 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others, taking them back into Gaza.
The brutality of the attack on the festival shocked the world. As revelers danced and partied in the desert, scores of Hamas terrorists stormed the site, blocked off escape routes, and embarked on a killing spree. They ambushed groups trying to hide and murdered people as they tried to escape. They shot victims at point blank range in their cars and fired machine guns and anti-tank weapons indiscriminately at those who tried to flee on foot.
Over the past year, the site of the massacre – a remote location just a few miles from the Gaza perimeter – has been turned into a memorial.
Instead of the vast open space, there are now hundreds of near identical cenotaphs, each featuring the name and a picture of a victim.
The one commemorating Amit Itzhak David shows a young man with a big smile. To mark the anniversary of his death, his family huddled around the memorial on Monday, hugging each other and David’s picture.
The 23-year-old was killed here last year, shortly after returning from a trip to South America, where he had been celebrating the end of his compulsory military service.
David’s cousin Inbar Parnassa told CNN the family doesn’t come to the site often. “It’s too difficult to be here and see all of this,” she said. Parnassa and other members of the family were all wearing matching T-shirts embroidered with David’s name and the sign of the horns – his favorite gesture.
Nor far away, Anat Magnezi, the mother of Amit Magnezi, was kneeling on the floor next to his photograph, sobbing. A music lover and a former junior wrestler, Amit too was murdered at the site.
The Nova Music Festival massacre was by far the deadliest of the October 7 attacks, accounting for nearly a third of the victims. There were so many dead and kidnapped that it took Israeli authorities months to determine how many people had been killed there.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday that 347 people, most of them young, died at the site and some 40 others were kidnapped.
Gabriel Barel’s mother, three brothers, and a best friend from the army all turned up in matching tops featuring his photograph. Barel’s brother Yeoda said the family initially believed he might have survived the attack and been taken to Gaza.
But a few weeks later their hopes were crushed when Barel’s body was found. After shooting Barel dead, his attackers had set his car on fire. His remains were so badly burnt it took many weeks for him to be identified.
Witnesses to the massacre say other victims were raped and subjected to sexual violence by Hamas. Hamas has denied the accusations, but the evidence of sexual violence comes from different sources — survivors who witnessed the events, first responders, medical and forensic experts. The United Nations and the International Criminal Court have offered evidence that Hamas attackers committed sexual crimes.
War rages on
Monday marked the first anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks, and a year since Israel began its war against the militant group in Gaza.
More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then. The war has sparked a major humanitarian disaster, displacing nearly all of the strip’s 2.2 million residents.
As people gathered across Israel, the reminders that the war in Gaza is still raging kept coming. Throughout the morning, loud booms of outgoing fire reverberated throughout southern Israel as the IDF hit targets in the Gaza strip.
Israel has said its goal in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas and bring back the remaining hostages, but neither has been achieved. Indeed, as the anniversary events got under way, several rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel, injuring two people.
While increasingly rare, rocket launches such as these show that even after a year of intense war, militants in Gaza are still able to strike Israel.
During a memorial service in kibbutz Nir Oz, the smoke trail of the rockets fired from Gaza was clearly visible in the sky. The agricultural commune of 400 people was another site targeted during the October 7 attacks; one in four of its residents were murdered or kidnapped.
Lighting a candle at the graveside of his friend Dolev Yehud, Daniel Lifshitz told CNN everyone in the tight-knit community was affected by the attack.
Yehud was a volunteer medic at Nir Oz and when he realized the kibbutz was under attack and there were wounded, he rushed out to provide help. He was killed, but his remains were not found and identified until June. Yehud’s pregnant wife Sigal and three children survived the massacre. His fourth child was born just nine days later.
Yehud’s sister Arbel was kidnapped and taken to Gaza with her boyfriend Ariel Cunio, alongside Cunio’s brother David, David’s wife Sharon Alony Cunio, and their three-year-old twin daughters.
Alony Cunio and the two girls were released during a ceasefire deal agreed in November, but the rest of the group remains in captivity.
“Dolev’s sister is still in Gaza. She’s one of the four or five civilian women still there alive. The most important thing now is to bring her and the rest of them back,” he said.
Lifshitz grew up in the kibbutz and while he left at 16, he still has deep links there. His grandparents Oded and Yocheved were kidnapped from their homes in the kibbutz during the attack.
Yocheved Lifshitz, who was 85 when kidnapped, spent more than two weeks in captivity. She was released alongside her neighbor and friend Nurit Cooper, 79, but both her and Cooper’s husbands were kept in Gaza.
Nurit Cooper and her family were told in June that Amiram Cooper, her 84-year-old husband and one of the founders of the kibbutz, was no longer alive. His body is still in Gaza.
“We cannot move on when people from the kibbutz are still there. Time stopped here,” Amat Moshe, whose grandparents were residents of the kibbutz, told CNN at the Nir Oz cemetery.
Last October, Moshe’s grandmother Adina Moshe watched Hamas fighters storm her home and murder her husband David before kidnapping her and taking her to Gaza. She was released as part of a ceasefire deal in November last year.
Sitting by David’s grave during the memorial ceremony on Monday, Adina was sobbing, her body slumped as if crushed by the horrors of the past year. Her daughter Maya Shoshani Moshe hurried to her side, trying to comfort her before bursting into tears herself.
Moshe has previously spoken publicly about her ordeal in Gaza and has in the past made an emotional plea directly to Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the remaining hostages back.
“Again, I am asking you, Mr. Netanyahu, everything is in your hands, you’re the one who can do it, and I’m extremely scared, that if you continue along this path…there won’t be any more hostages to release,” she said in February after Netanyahu rejected the terms of a ceasefire and hostage deal put forward by Hamas.
She expressed the views of many Israelis who are furious with Netanyahu. Mass protests against the prime minister and his government have once again become a common occurrence across the country and the anger burst into the public view on several occasions during the memorial events on Monday.
Early in the day, family members of the hostages marched to Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, blasting a siren for two minutes outside his front door.
Netanyahu did not make an appearance at the event, or any other gatherings aside from a small ceremony in Jerusalem.
When hundreds of people gathered in Tel Aviv on Monday evening to commemorate the victims of the attacks, politics was meant to be off limits. But it soon became clear that for many of the family members who were speaking at the event, politics is too intertwined with the fate of their loved ones.
Jonathan Shimriz, the brother of Alon Shimriz who was taken hostage and later killed in Gaza during a failed rescue operation, called for a state inquiry into the handling of the hostage crisis.
“There is no personal example, no vision, no leadership, no accountability,” he told the crowd.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/politics/us-not-currently-pushing-revive-israel-hezbollah-deal/index.html,"US is not currently pushing to revive Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal, officials say",2024-10-04 00:00:00,"Two weeks after Israel upended a US-led ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, the US is not actively trying to revive the deal and has resigned itself to trying to shape and limit Israeli operations in Lebanon and against Iran rather than halting hostilities, US officials told CNN.
The US’ inability to halt Israel’s intense bombing campaign and ground invasion of Lebanon, which has killed over 1,400 people in less than three weeks and displaced over 1 million more, has raised questions about whether Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is disregarding the Biden administration’s calls for more restraint like it did in Gaza, leaving the White House again looking feckless.
Concerns within the Biden administration are running high, officials say, that what Israel has promised would be a limited operation will soon grow into a larger-scale and prolonged conflict. US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have also floundered.
As with Gaza, US officials say Israel was initially planning for a much larger ground incursion into Lebanon before the US convinced it to scale back. But they also acknowledge what they have learned over the last year, which is that the US’ influence is limited when it comes to Israel’s military operations.
“We couldn’t stop them from taking action, but we can at least try to shape what it looks like,” one senior US official told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations.
The ceasefire proposal, which the US put forward with France, had called for a 21-day pause in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah to give the sides space to work on a larger deal to return Israeli and Lebanese civilians to their homes in northern Israel and southern Lebanon.
“We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah’s infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah’s capability, but we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday. “And ultimately, that’s not the outcome that we want to see.”
Senior US officials have also acknowledged that the US has limited leverage over what Israel decides to do against Iran following Tehran’s missile attack last week.
The US has been urging Israel not to be overly escalatory with a retaliatory strike, the official said. But they cautioned that what Israel sees as a proportional attack may not be in line with what the rest of the world — including the US — would consider to be a measured response.
President Joe Biden said last week that he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear facilities, but it is not clear whether the US has successfully persuaded Israel to take that option off the table.
“The only leverage that the Americans have right now is summoning the defense minister to Washington and buying time,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, told CNN.
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is scheduled to meet with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Wednesday, a visit the Biden administration may hope buys time for consultations and planning before Israel carries out its promised retaliation against Iran. With Gallant in Washington, Pinkas says the US likely believes Israel will wait to attack.
“This would make sense in a political science simulation game, not in Israeli politics,” Pinkas said.
Netanyahu was in New York when Israel carried out the massive strike in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. An attack against Iran, though far more complicated than striking a neighboring country, could still be carried out with the defense minister abroad, Pinkas said, especially given the acrimonious relationship between Netanyahu and Gallant.
Gallant said Israel is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran, but Israel will ultimately make its own decision about how it retaliates.
“Everything is on the table,” Gallant told CNN on Sunday.
‘The right moment’ for diplomacy
The US still wants to see Lebanon ceasefire talks resume, officials said, and US officials continue to believe that the conflict can only be resolved diplomatically.
“We’re going to be having regular consultations with the Israelis, with the Lebanese and others, regarding the right moment to press for such an agreement,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.
But “the Israelis have to get beyond some things before we can revisit those conversations,” said one senior administration official.
That official and another source said it is not even clear at this point who the US would be dealing with on any ceasefire talks. Nasrallah and other members of Hezbollah’s senior leadership are now dead as a result of Israel’s operations in Lebanon. And while one US official expressed hope that the Lebanese government could now exert more control over the militant group, the Lebanese state is experiencing a similar power vacuum, having been without a president or fully empowered Cabinet since October 2022.
Austin said Friday that he believes the Lebanese government has an important opportunity to demonstrate “that it wants to care for its people” and siphon support away from Hezbollah, particularly now that the group’s chain of command “has really been stripped away at the strategic and operational level.”
But Israel’s punishing air campaign in Beirut could make it harder for a functioning Lebanese government to emerge from the rubble, one of the officials noted.
“What’s going on in Beirut is not what we had wanted,” he said.
Austin and other senior members of Biden’s national security team – including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. CQ Brown, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines – convened in the Oval Office on September 30 for several hours, discussing Israel’s intensifying operations in Lebanon. Earlier in the day, a reluctant Biden told reporters he’d be “comfortable with [Israel] stopping” the campaign in Lebanon that risked further inflaming the region. Behind closed doors, sources say, Biden offered reluctant support for eliminating Hezbollah infrastructure along Israel’s border and in southern Lebanon, as long as Israel’s operations remained limited in nature.
While the US has been generally supportive of that strategy, several officials including Austin have voiced concerns to Israel about mitigating civilian harm in its airstrikes —particularly in southern Beirut, a densely populated area where several residential buildings have been flattened in recent weeks.
“The secretary has been very clear about the importance of taking civilian safety into account when planning and conducting operations, and that hasn’t changed,” Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Monday when asked whether he supports Israel’s operations in Beirut. “That continues to be a topic of discussion between [Austin] and Minister Gallant.”
Israel says it is working to mitigate civilian casualties, noting that it has issued evacuation notices to Lebanese residents in recent days before conducting operations. But CNN teams in Beirut last week found that many Israeli strikes happened without prior warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping.
US officials are also concerned about the operations Israel is conducting so close to Beirut’s main airport, which could threaten the ability of American citizens to leave the country via the limited commercial options that remain.
Ryder said the US is in discussions with Israel about the airport as it relates to the safety of Americans living in the country, and State Department spokesperson Miller said the US “has made clear” to Israel that it wants the roads to the airport in Beirut to “continue to be operational.”
