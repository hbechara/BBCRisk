https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/27/world/pokrovsk-russia-ukraine-war-troops-intl,"Russia has amassed 110,000 troops near strategic Ukrainian city, Kyiv says",2025-06-27 15:36:57,"Russia has amassed 110,000 troops in the vicinity of Pokrovsk as part of its efforts to take over the strategic eastern Ukrainian city, the Ukrainian military chief said Friday.
Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Friday that the area around Pokrovsk was the “hottest spot” along the 1,200-kilometre (745 miles) front line which runs across the east.
Russian forces have been trying to capture Pokrovsk for almost a year, staging one grinding offensive after another. But despite having a clear advantage in terms of the number of troops and weapons available, Moscow has failed to take over the city.
Pokrovsk is a strategic target for Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear that his goal is to seize all of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk his forces partially occupy.
Kyiv and its allies accuse Putin of stalling on peace efforts so that his forces can seize more Ukrainian territory.
Although not a major city, Pokrovsk sits on a key supply road and railroad that connect it with other military hubs in the area. Together with Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, it forms the backbone of Ukrainian defenses in the part of Donetsk region that is still under Kyiv’s control.
Some 60,000 lived in Pokrovsk before the war, but the majority have left in the three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Ukraine’s last operating coking coal mine was in Pokrovsk and many of its employees were staying in the area to keep it going. Once it was forced to shut down early this year, they too began to leave.
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitor, said late last year that Ukrainian defensive operations in Pokrovsk have forced Russia to abandon its original plan to take over Pokrovsk in a frontal assault.
The ISW said this was because Ukrainian troops began using drones as integral part of their defensive strategy, successfully integrating drone operators with their ground forces.
At the same time, Russia was unable to increase the number of troops in the area by much, because it was trying to contain the surprise incursion of Ukrainian troops into its own territory in the southern Kursk region.
Syrskyi told reporters last week that at one point, the Kursk operation pulled back nearly 63,000 Russian troops and some 7,000 North Korean troops.
“This allowed us to weaken the enemy’s pressure on the main fronts and regroup our troops. And the enemy’s capture of Pokrovsk, announced back in September 2024, has not yet taken place, thanks in part to our Kursk operation,” he said.
Instead of continuing to attacking the city directly, Russian troops then began encircling the city from south and northeast.
The ISW said in its most recent assessment on Friday that Russian forces were continuing assaults with small fireteams of one to two soldiers, sometimes on motorcycles, in all-terrain vehicles and buggies.
In a statement issued on Friday, Syrksky said Russia continued to try to break through to the administrative border of the Donetsk region.
“They want to do this not only to achieve some operational results, but primarily for demonstrative purposes. To achieve a psychological effect: to put the infamous ‘foot of the Russian soldier’ there, plant a flag and trumpet another pseudo-‘victory,’” he said.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/europe/zelensky-ukraine-special-tribunal-intl,Zelensky and European rights body establish tribunal to allow prosecution of Russian leaders,2025-06-26 11:23:54,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed an agreement with the Council of Europe (CoE) to create a tribunal that would allow for the prosecution of senior Russian officials who have led the war on Ukraine.
Zelensky signed the accord on Wednesday alongside CoE Secretary General Alain Berset in the French city of Strasbourg, where the organization is headquartered.
The Ukrainian leader has portrayed the special tribunal as paramount to holding Russian officials responsible for the full-scale invasion of his country, which began in February 2022 and has grinded on for more than three years, with a huge human cost.
The establishment of the tribunal is aimed at widening the net for those who can be tried over the conflict. The International Criminal Court (ICC), which focuses on crimes against humanity, has already issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and several other high-profile political and military Russian figures.
The new body will deal with the crime of aggression, specifically regarding the use of armed force by one state against another. It marks the first time that the CoE has set up such a tribunal.
“The Tribunal, formally launched today, creates a real opportunity to hold the leadership of the Russian regime accountable for the crimes committed against our state and our people,” the Ukrainian president wrote on X.
“We will continue working to ensure justice for all victims. Criminals must face trial in The Hague and be punished.”
Berset said: “This historic signature reminds us that international law must apply to all – with no exceptions, and with no double standards.”
Alongside Putin, the ICC, based in The Hague, issued an arrest warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia’s presidential commissioner for children’s rights, in March 2023. Both are accused of the illegal deportation and transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia.
In March 2024, the court also issued arrest warrants for Viktor Sokolov, a Russian navy officer and former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, and Sergei Kobylash, a lLieutenant general in the Russian Armed Forces. The two are accused of the war crime of causing excessive incidental harm to civilians and the crime against humanity of inhumane acts.
Meanwhile, ceasefire negotiations to end the war in Ukraine have mostly stalled despite mediation from the Trump administration.
The talks between Russia, Ukraine and third countries have struggled to make progress after Moscow refused to back off its maximalist demands and presented a ceasefire proposal that would essentially amount to Ukraine’s capitulation.
At the same time, Russia keeps ramping up its attacks against Ukrainian cities. Russian forces killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians in less than 48 hours on Monday and Tuesday, according to Ukrainian officials, two of the deadliest days in many months.",['Sophie Tanno'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/europe/russian-attacks-ukraine-nato-summit-latam-intl,Russian attacks kill dozens of Ukrainians as Kyiv’s allies gather for a key NATO summit,2025-06-24 00:00:00,"Russia killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians in less than 48 hours on Monday and Tuesday, according to Ukrainian officials, two of the deadliest days in many months.
A five-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl were among the victims of the Russian attacks, launched just as Ukraine’s allies began gathering for a key NATO meeting in the Netherlands.
Ukrainian officials said 15 people were killed in Dnipro on Tuesday after a Russian ballistic missile hit the city, the largest in the country’s south-east, while 9 people were killed in a strike on a Kyiv apartment building on Monday.
At least two dozen others were killed in strikes across the country, including in Sumy, Kherson, Donetsk and Odesa regions.
In Dnipro, local officials said the missile caused damage unlike any previous attacks on the city.
Mayor Borys Filatov said almost 50 buildings were damaged, including schools, medical facilities, municipal sites and residential buildings.
“This is an unprecedented amount of destruction that the city has never seen before in the entire time of the full-scale war. The number of victims is so high that even ambulances cannot keep up,” he added.
More than 170 people were injured, according to authorities, with around 100 remaining in city hospitals as of Tuesday evening.
A passenger train carrying some 500 people was also damaged in the strike.
“In residential buildings and various municipal facilities throughout the city, we have over 2,000 shattered windows alone,” he said.
Zelensky highlights Russia’s ties to Iran
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky was in The Hague for the NATO summit on Tuesday, meeting several European leaders on its sidelines before addressing the Dutch parliament.
Ukraine is not a member of NATO and, while it wants to join, the issue of its potential future membership remains contentious. Russia has tried to prevent Ukraine from ever being able to join the alliance, with Moscow arguing that NATO’s eastward expansion following the end of the Cold War has posed threats to its security.
Zelensky met NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President of the European Council Antonia Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, all of whom have reiterated their support for Ukraine.
He was hoping to meet US President Donald Trump later on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian officials.
The two were scheduled to meet at the G7 summit in Canada earlier this month, but that meeting did not happen as Trump left the summit earlier than expected because of the Iran-Israel conflict.
As the world turned its attention to the Middle East, Zelensky was keen to highlight the connection between Iran and Russia.
Iran has been among Russia’s strongest backers since President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Iranian regime has supplied Moscow with weapons, including short-range ballistic missiles and thousands of Shahed drones; according to US officials, it has also built a drone factory in Russia.
Moscow has in turn stood by Iran during the recent conflict with Israel and after the US strikes against Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.
Russia has intensified its aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent weeks, after successfully scaling up its domestic production of its most frequently used type of drone – the Iran-designed Shahed.
Zelensky said on Tuesday that Russia has launched 28,743 Shahed drones against Ukraine since 2022, with 2,736 fired by so far this month.
“Russia could never have done this without its ties to the Iranian regime,” he said.
The Ukrainian leader told reporters at the summit that there were no signs Putin wanted to stop his war against Ukraine.
“Russia rejects all peace proposals, including those from the United States of America. Putin only thinks about war. That’s a fact. Maybe he connects his own political survival with his ability to keep killing, so long as he kills, he lives,” Zelensky said.
Talks between Russia, Ukraine and third countries have mostly stalled after Moscow refused to back off its maximalist demands and presented a ceasefire proposal that would essentially amount to Ukraine’s capitulation.
Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, British Defense Secretary John Healy said that while “all eyes have been on the Middle East,” it was crucial not to forget about Ukraine.
“Putin wants our focus to slip, and part of the strong message from NATO is that we will not let that happen, and this session is an important part of that,” he said.
Zelensky was in London on Monday, where he met British Prime Minister Keir Starmer as well as King Charles III.
Kyiv officials said the attack on the apartment building on Monday killed multiple members of several families.
Lusy Alekseenkova, a journalist with a Ukrainian TV channel, said her brother, his wife and her sister-in-law’s father were killed in the attack on Kyiv, with her 16-year-old nephew the sole survivor.
The same strike left a mother and her 11-year-old daughter dead, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv Military Administration, said on Telegram, adding that it took many hours to recover the little girl’s body.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'James Frater']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/21/europe/belarus-opposition-freed-us-intl,Belarus frees key opposition figure Sergey Tikhanovsky following rare visit from top US envoy,2025-06-21 17:07:45,"Belarus has freed Sergey Tikhanovsky, a key dissident figure and the husband of exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, following a rare visit by a senior US official, Tikhanovskaya’s team announced on Saturday.
Tikhanovsky, a popular blogger and activist who was jailed in 2020, arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, alongside 13 other political prisoners, his wife’s team said. The release came just hours after Belarusian authorities announced that authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko met with US President Donald Trump’s envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, in Minsk.
A video published on his wife’s official Telegram account showed Tikhanovsky disembarking a white minibus, with a shaved head and broad smile. He pulled Tikhanovskaya into a long embrace as their supporters applauded.
“My husband is free. It’s difficult to describe the joy in my heart,” Tikhanovskaya told reporters. But she added her team’s work is “not finished” while over 1,100 political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus.
Tikhanovsky was jailed after announcing plans to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 election. Following his arrest, his wife ran in his stead, rallying large crowds across the country. Official results of the election handed Lukashenko his sixth term in office but were denounced by the opposition and the West as a sham.
As unprecedented protests broke out in the aftermath of the vote, Tikhanovskaya left the country under pressure from the authorities. Her husband was later sentenced to 19 1/2 years in prison on charges of organizing mass riots.
Other prominent dissidents remain in Belarusian jails, among them Nobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski, a human rights advocate serving a 10-year prison sentence on charges widely denounced as politically motivated. Also behind bars is Viktor Babaryka, a former banker who was widely seen in 2020 as Lukashenko’s main electoral rival, and Maria Kolesnikova, a charismatic leader of that year’s mass protests.
Released alongside Tikhanovsky was longtime Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty correspondent Ihar Karnei, the US government-funded broadcaster confirmed. Karnei, who had also worked with prominent Belarusian and Russian newspapers, had been serving a three-year service on extremism charges he rejected as a sham.
RFE/RL’s Belarusian service had been designated extremist in the country, a common label handed to anyone who criticizes Lukashenko’s government. As a result, working for it or spreading its content has become a criminal offense.
“We are deeply grateful to President Trump for securing the release of this brave journalist, who suffered at the hands of the Belarusian authorities,” the broadcaster’s CEO Stephen Capus said Saturday in a press release.
Karnei was detained several times while covering the 2020 protests. Unlike many of his colleagues, he chose to stay in Belarus despite the ensuing repression. He was arrested again in July 2023, as police raided his apartment seizing phones and computers.
Belarus also freed an Estonian national who had set up an NGO to raise funds for Belarusian refugees. According to the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Allan Roio was detained last January, and sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison on charges of establishing an extremist organization.","['Story Associated Press', 'Associated Press']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/18/middleeast/russia-iran-israel-conflict-ally-analysis-hnk-intl,"Analysis: Even if Russia loses Iran as an ally, it stands to profit from the chaos in the Middle East",2025-06-18 04:18:20,"There’s long been an awkward tension at the heart of the Kremlin’s complex relationship with the Middle East.
On the one hand, Russian alliances and economic influence there have traditionally been strong.
On the other, as one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers, Russia tends to profit when things in the energy-rich region go awry and the markets get spooked.
That’s exactly what is playing out right now, with the Kremlin watching its Iranian ally being drastically weakened by Israeli airstrikes, while reaping the benefits.
On the face of it, Russia has so much to lose.
Iran has been a particularly useful “strategic partner” for the Kremlin, not only sharing a disdain for Western values and influence, but also supplying the Russian military with vast squadrons of Shahed aerial drones, enabling the relentless bombardment of Ukraine.
Much of that drone production has, admittedly, long since moved to Russia. But with Ukraine’s own drones now striking Russian production facilities deep behind the frontlines, that once reliable Iranian supply may eventually be missed.
There’s also a faint but painful sense of humiliation for the Kremlin to have to stand by and watch yet another key Middle Eastern ally under ferocious bombardment, unable or unwilling to step in.
Moscow has issued strongly-worded statements, of course, condemning as “illegal” Israel’s attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities, adding that the strikes were creating “unacceptable threats to international security.”
It also accused Western countries of manipulating the situation to “settle political scores.”
But Russia’s supposed alliance with Iran never extended to defending the Islamic Republic and there has been no Kremlin offer of any military support.
It’s certainly true that a collapse of the Iranian regime, which is now an apparent Israeli objective, would add Iran to the growing Kremlin list of lost Middle Eastern alliances and client states, including Iraq, Libya and, most recently, Syria.
But here’s that awkward tension again: things are not quite as bad for Moscow as they may seem. In fact, this latest Middle Eastern conflict is playing very nicely into the Kremlin’s hands.
As well as the welcome financial windfall, courtesy of the surging price of crude oil, the Iran-Israel conflict is also opening up the taps, as it were, to diplomatic opportunities for a Kremlin that has faced years of international isolation over its war in Ukraine.
Russia has never stopped seeing itself as a major player in international diplomacy, with a rightful place at the top table alongside the US and China.
Now, the Kremlin has an issue on which it can jointly and productively cooperate with the United States, and possibly emerge as an indispensable US partner when it comes to eventually patching the region back together again.
As the only major political leader with a direct line to the Iranians, the Israelis and the United States, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is already carefully leveraging his pivotal position, signaling his willingness to act as a mediator, casting Russia as an important power broker in the Middle East.
In a recent call to the White House, Putin reminded President Donald Trump how Russia has been a long-time US ally when it comes to the Iranian nuclear issue – a heavy hint that he is open to being one again.
Initially, Trump expressed a willingness to consider the Russian leader as a potential mediator in the conflict, although he has since downplayed it.
Since the start of Trump’s second term, Washington and Moscow have been desperate to find ways to broaden their relationship beyond the narrow focus on the Ukraine war. The fate of Iran and its nuclear ambitions have unexpectedly reemerged – along with the Arctic, economic cooperation and space exploration – as yet another area of potential common interest.
For the Kremlin – and maybe for Trump too – that’s a major boon.
Not so much for beleaguered Ukraine.",['Matthew Chance'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/17/europe/kyiv-deadly-strikes-trump-g7-intl-hnk,28 killed in deadliest Russian strikes on Kyiv in almost a year,2025-06-17 06:22:14,"Russia launched a barrage of hundreds of drones and missiles on Kyiv overnight, killing more than 20 people in one of its biggest attacks on the Ukrainian capital.
The State Emergency Service of Ukraine said at least 28 people were killed in Kyiv, and 134 were injured.
One strike hit a multi-story residential building, splitting it in two and leaving a huge gap where dozens of homes were just moments before. The Emergency Service said 23 bodies had been pulled out of the rubble as of Wednesday morning.
Victoria, who lives in the building and didn’t want to share her last name, said she spent part of the night sheltering in her bathroom, the safest place in the apartment, listening to Russian drones flying overhead. When she thought the attack was over, she went back to bed – only to be woken by a loud explosion.
“The windows were blown out. It was very scary. Adrenaline was pumping. Just survival instincts. I tried to get out of the apartment, but my neighbors’ doors were blocking my door,” she told CNN, adding that she only realized her building had been hit when her neighbors managed to clear the door and she fled to the street.
“I thought I was ready to die and wasn’t afraid of anything. But today I realized that I’m scared. For the first time, I was scared,” said Victoria, who fled her home in Luhansk in eastern Ukraine after Russia occupied it in 2014.
Oleksandr Ustenko, who lives with his family on the second floor of the same building, told CNN he heard drones flying overhead throughout the night.
“Then we heard a sound of a missile. At some point, everything started shaking, the ceiling shook, and the door was blown out,” he said, adding that as they ran into the hallway, everything around them was on fire.
“We barely made it to the street. We are still here. The apartment is almost destroyed, our car is destroyed.”
The Russian assault was the deadliest on the capital in almost a year, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said on Tuesday.
The ministry said rescue operations were ongoing as of Tuesday evening, as more people were believed to be in the rubble.
Two other people were killed in attacks on the southern port city of Odessa.
“Last night’s attack was the fourth time this month that Russian armed forces launched more than 400 munitions in a single night. By comparison, Russian armed forces launched 544 long-range munitions during the entire month in June 2024,” the HRMMU said in a statement.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said in a Telegram post that residential buildings and other infrastructure were severely damaged.
“We hope that no dead will be found under the rubble, but we cannot rule it out,” he added. “The death toll may increase.”
Klitschko said in the message that a US citizen was killed in the Solomyanskyi district of Kyiv overnight. The mayor said the person was 62 years old and “died in a house opposite to the one where medics were providing assistance to the victims,” without giving any more details.
Later Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed a US citizen was among those killed in Kyiv.
“We condemn those strikes and extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected,” Bruce said at a State Department briefing, adding the department was “ready to provide all possible consular assistance” to the family of the American who was killed.
Despite the civilian deaths and evidence of direct strikes on residential buildings, the Russian defense ministry said on Tuesday that it targeted “military-industrial complex facilities in the Kyiv region and Zaporizhzhia.”
The Ukrainian Air Force said 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched at Ukraine overnight and added that it manage to destroy 428 of them.
Russia has ramped up its airborne attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching as many as 479 drones and missiles in a single night. Ukrainian officials say these assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.
Some 27 locations in different districts of Kyiv came under fire in the latest attack, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs, Ihor Klymenko.
“Rescuers, police and medics are working. They are doing everything they can to help the victims, clear the rubble and save lives,” he said.
The strikes come as US President Donald Trump announced he would return to Washington a day early from the Group of 7 summit in Canada.
His early departure means he will miss a key meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the event.
It would have been the leaders’ third meeting since Trump took office in January.
Ukrainian officials had been hoping that a positive interaction with Trump could advance Kyiv’s case amid Moscow’s intensifying attacks.
Meanwhile, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu arrived in Pyongyang on a “special mission” from Russian leader Vladimir Putin, according to Russian state news agency TASS.
Shoigu is scheduled to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Tass reported Tuesday.
Pyongyang has continued support for Moscow’s war on Ukraine as world leaders push for an end to the three-year conflict.
North Korea has sent soldiers and millions of munitions, including missiles and rockets, to Russia over the past year, according to a May report by an international watchdog, the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team.
The US has warned that Russia may be close to sharing advanced space and satellite technology with North Korea in exchange for continued support for the war in Ukraine.
Under Trump, the US has been less willing to equip badly outgunned Ukraine directly, has pushed European partners to pick up more of the support and threatened to walk away altogether from peace talks.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/16/politics/g7-trump-lies-canada-ukraine,"Fact check: At G7, Trump makes false claims about Trudeau, trade, Ukraine and immigration",2025-06-16 00:00:00,"While visiting Canada on Monday for a Group of 7 summit, President Donald Trump repeated one of his many false claims about Canada – again wrongly blaming former Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for getting Russia booted out of the group formerly known as the Group of 8.
Speaking of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump claimed Monday: “He was thrown out – by Trudeau, who convinced one or two people, along with Obama. He was thrown out. And he’s not a happy person about it, I can tell you that.”
In fact, Trudeau did not become Canada’s prime minister until November 2015 – more than 19 months after Russia’s 2014 ouster from the Group of 8, a forum made up of countries with large industrialized economies. It was Trudeau’s Conservative predecessor as prime minister, Stephen Harper, who led the effort to kick Russia out in the wake of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region. Trudeau’s Liberals were not even the biggest opposition party in Canada’s House of Commons at the time.
Trump made the false claim while standing beside Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trudeau’s successor as Liberal leader.
Trump made a similar false claim about Trudeau during an exchange with reporters at the White House in May, incorrectly saying of Russia’s removal from the Group of 8: “I thought it was a very bad decision. It was headed by Trudeau, by the way, and Obama. They were the ones that really fought hard to get Russia out.”
Trade and US aid to Ukraine: Trump made other false claims in his Monday remarks at the G7. Speaking to reporters alongside UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump erroneously described his trade deal with the UK as a deal with the European Union, which the UK does not belong to. Trump then twice repeated his long-debunked assertion that former President Joe Biden had given “$350 billion” in aid to Ukraine.
The figure is not close to correct.
According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks international aid to Ukraine, the US had committed about $138 billion in military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine from late January 2022, just prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion, through April 2025. (That period includes more than three months of Trump’s current presidency.)
It’s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is, regardless, no basis for Trump’s “$350 billion” figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the response to the invasion of Ukraine says on its website that the US had appropriated about $185 billion for the response through March 2025, including about $90 billion actually disbursed – and that includes money spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine.",['Daniel Dale'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd,"Russia is shifting tactics again, assaulting Ukrainian cities with swarms of killer drones",2025-06-15 04:01:03,"On a recent evening in Kyiv, 4-year-old Olexander Reshetnik made a simple suggestion to his parents: “Let’s go to the parking garage now so we can sleep properly, and you don’t have to wake us up twice to take us there and back.”
The family lives on the 18th floor of a high-rise building and getting into the underground garage that doubles as a bomb shelter during Russian attacks is an uncomfortable experience. With aerial attacks becoming more common, it made sense to Oleksander to simply stay there.
Even at his young age, he knew the Russians would likely attack again.
His mother Khrystyna Reshetnik said the family has gotten used to seeing drones being shot down in the skies over Ukraine’s capital. In days gone by there would be one or two, maybe three, but things have changed.
“Lately, they’ve been flying like a swarm that doesn’t stop for three or four hours. Explosions right outside the windows,” she told CNN.
Russia has ramped up its airborne attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching as many as 479 drones and missiles in a single night. These assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.
The increase in the number of drones Russia is deploying against its neighbor is stunning: seven of Moscow’s largest drone attacks in its war on Ukraine have happened in the past four weeks, according to a CNN tally.
Russia ramps up drone production
Russia successfully scaled up the domestic production of its most frequently used drone – the Iranian-designed Shahed – last fall and is now churning out hundreds of these killing machines every day.
Christina Harward, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said that according to current estimates, Moscow can now produce about 2,700 Shahed drones per month, as well as some 2,500 decoy drones.
“These numbers are allowing Russia to more frequently launch over 300 or even 400 drones in just one night,” she told CNN.
The fact that some of the drones are decoys makes little difference to the Ukrainian defenses as Moscow has adapted them in a way that makes it very difficult to distinguish them from the real thing.
“So, either Ukrainian forces spend time trying to identify the decoys or they spend precious resources shooting them down. Either way, this helps the Russian missiles and Shaheds – with their large payloads – (as they) have the chance to get through to their targets,” Harward said.
The increased number of drones launched each night is overwhelming Ukrainian air defenses, especially since Russia began to zero in on handful of locations at a time.
On Monday night, it targeted the Ukrainian capital and the Black Sea port city of Odesa. The following night, it was Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.
“Instead of targeting a bit here and there, they concentrate the strikes and are able to achieve maximum effect, both kinetic and psychological,” Oleksiy Melnyk, a former Ukrainian defense ministry official who is now the co-director of foreign relations and international security programs at the Razumkov Center in Kyiv, told CNN.
Russia maintains that it does not target civilians, but evidence to the contrary continues to mount. At least 154 Ukrainian civilians – including children – have been killed by drones, in Russian missile assaults and by artillery across the country in the last four weeks. A further 900 civilians have been injured.
The deadly attacks are designed to undermine Ukrainian morale and create the illusion that Russia has the upper hand in the war – even though Moscow is far from “winning.”
The front line in Ukraine has not moved in any significant way since Ukrainian forces liberated the southern city of Kherson in November 2023.
Russia has only managed to seize about 5,000 square kilometers (1,900 square miles) of Ukraine’s territory since then. Russian troops have advanced in some areas in eastern and northern Ukraine in recent months but have not managed to break through or take over a major city.
‘Impossible to shoot them down’
Yuriy Chumak spends many of his nights perched on Kyiv’s rooftops, machine gun in hand. A Supreme Court judge by day, he is part of a volunteer drone-hunting unit by night. He said the skies have gotten significantly busier in recent weeks.
“There are many more drones. This is an objective fact. And, of course, the more there are, the harder it is to work against them,” Chumak told CNN.
He said after Moscow started flying drones at higher altitudes, it has become much harder, if not impossible, for his unit to destroy them.
Previously, Russian forces would fly the drones low, for example along a riverbed, to avoid being detected by Ukraine’s air defenses for as long as possible.
“The time to respond was very short because we only detected it when it was (close),” he said.
These days, he said, Russian drones are flying two to five kilometers (1 to 3 miles) above the ground.
“We can see them all. Radars can track them. But it has become impossible to shoot them down with machine guns,” Chumak said, adding that Ukraine now has to use missiles to thwart them.
But missiles are in much shorter supply. This is pushing Ukrainian forces to find new solutions on the go. Melnyk said that the efficiency of Ukraine’s air defense system remains remarkable. “Even now, about 80% of drones are being intercepted. A few months ago, this percentage was about 95. (But) we can see the impact of Russia increasing the number (of drones) and changing tactics,” he added.
Speaking to reporters last month, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the Ukrainian Air Force and volunteers like Chumak for pivoting as Russia ramped up its air war.
He added that Kyiv was now using drone-to-drone interceptors to combat the higher altitude bombardment. “We have the technology. The question is when we will be able to expand,” he said.
Zelensky said that Russia can produce some 300 to 350 drones a day, while Ukraine can only make 100.
“The issue is no longer about production capacity. It’s financial,” he said.
‘The norm for our children’
Kyiv mom Khrystyna Reshetnik said one of the worst things about the Russian aerial assaults is that they have become commonplace to her three boys, aged 4, 8 and 11. Olexander regularly asks whether the noise he hears is a Kalibr cruise missile or a drone.
“He’s just a little boy and he already understands what’s going on,” Reshetnik said. As the attacks have intensified in size and scope, the family has been spending more time in the underground parking garage, where Olexander and his two brothers sleep in the trunk of their car.
“This has become the norm for our children. It hurts my heart,” she said.
Yet despite the daily horrors they experience, the Reshetniks are among the lucky ones. They live in Kyiv, a city that is relatively well defended. The majority of the explosions they hear are Ukrainian air defenses intercepting Russian drones.
Many others elsewhere around the country are left without protective shields because Ukraine’s access to air defenses is limited by what its Western allies are willing to spare. Closer to the front lines, Russian troops have been using smaller drones to target civilians.
“We talk about these big attacks, especially when Kyiv is under attack, but cities like Sumy or Kherson are under attack 24/7,” Melnyk said, interrupted by an air raid alarm as he spoke to CNN.
“There is (a) ballistic missile coming, so I am going to go into the shelter. My point is that this is the daily life of Ukrainian citizens and civilians.”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/sport/oleksandr-usyk-ukraine-war-daniel-dubois-boxing-spt,Oleksandr Usyk: World heavyweight champion keeps Ukraine on his mind as he prepares for his next big fight,2025-06-12 10:00:03,"Perched on Spain’s eastern coast, the touristy town of Gandia may not look like an obvious home for one of Ukraine’s biggest stars, but it’s here that world heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk is basing himself ahead of his next fight.
Quieter than other towns in the vicinity, its geography and climate confer it a surprising but important characteristic for Usyk and his team: it looks and feels like southern Crimea.
The links to Usyk’s home province and country don’t stop there. Step inside his base – a co-working center turned fortress and gym – and you will see references to Ukraine everywhere.
From the yellow and blue splashed on most walls, to the numerous flags, symbols and memorabilia he personally selected, Ukraine – and the war of survival it’s going through – are very much at the forefront of Usyk’s mind.
“It’s a little difficult to balance things when your family is in Kyiv,” the WBA, WBC and WBO heavyweight champion told CNN Sports.
Throughout the day, CNN witnesses him interacting with his two sons – hugging them, sharing jokes and even playing a little bit of soccer. They joined him at his training camp and, here, he knows they are safe. But some of his family have stayed behind in Ukraine.
“My two daughters and my wife,” he said. “But I just know that my Ukrainian people and my Ukrainian soldiers will protect them.”
When he’s not preparing for a fight, Usyk himself spends most of his time at the family home in Kyiv, so he knows all too well what his family is going through every night, as Russian drones and bombs continue to batter cities around the country.
He avoids the news as he tries to stay focused on his training, explaining it “would be a distraction.”
Still, the connections he’s made in the military – he joined Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 and has visited the frontlines on several occasions – means he’s immediately updated when something serious happens.
“The guys who are defending my country are on the front,” Usyk explained to CNN. “I have information that is sent to me. When things are dangerous, they tell me.”
They also share Ukraine’s successes, like the daring drone strikes the nation carried out on Russian air bases deep within the country.
“I would like to express my deep gratitude to Vasyl Vasyliovych (Malyuk, head of Ukraine’s Security Services [SBU]) – boss, great job,” he said, with a grin, beating his chest with his clenched fist. He added that he’s messaged the SBU chief as well.
But while a “distraction” from training is what Usyk wants to avoid as he prepares to unify the world heavyweight title for the second time in his career against Great Britain’s Daniel Dubois on July 19, distractions from the grueling and bloody battles at the front are a welcome break and exactly what his fellow soldiers need to take their minds away from the war.
“We try not to talk about the scary things they do to defend our country. What is happening there, what kind of shelling is happening, how they are being attacked, how they are heroically defending our country,” Usyk explained. “They’re more interested in what I’m doing. When I ask them questions, they say, ‘Wait, wait, wait. Tell us about yourself, what’s going on with you?’”
“At that moment, I show them videos of our training sessions,” he added.
Those moments are small respite for those fighting to defend Ukrainian sovereignty, roughly three years and three months after Moscow’s armies marched on Ukraine. But for the soldiers and Usyk, the war began long before with the annexation of his home in Crimea in 2014, just one year after he became a professional boxer.
The war, he admitted to CNN Sports, has played a defining role in his development as an athlete.
“I think that, in a way, it motivated me to do something for my country,” he said, adding that he’s not just fighting for himself.
He’s also used his platform to fundraise for Ukraine and frequently addresses the war and other issues facing his country on his social media accounts, advocating for his country and his people.
To that end, he has also pleaded with US President Donald Trump for more support, offering to host him at his family home, so he can experience what it’s like to live as Ukrainians do, under the threat of constant bombardment and air raids.
Yet despite all of his work outside the ring, he has remained an undefeated 23-0 in his career with 14 wins coming by way of knockout. And he is confident he’ll keep up his perfect record against Dubois at Wembley Stadium too.
“How confident am I? One hundred percent. 100,000,000%,” he told CNN Sports.
“It’s difficult (to tune out the war), but I can switch off to do my job so that I can help my country more later on.”","['Vasco Cotovio', 'Amanda Davies', 'Matthew Brealey', 'Kostya Gak']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/politics/group-tracking-abductions-ukraine-shutting-down,Group tracking Russian abductions of Ukrainian children prepares to shut down following Trump admin funding cut,2024-08-30 00:00:00,"The preeminent body tracking alleged Russian war crimes in the war with Ukraine, including the abduction of Ukrainian children, has transferred its data to Ukraine’s government and the US State Department as it prepares to shut down in the coming weeks after the Trump administration terminated its funding.
“Right now, we are running on fumes, we have about two weeks of money left, mostly through individual donations from our website. As of July 1, we lay off all of our staff across Ukraine and other teams and our work tracking the kids officially ends. We are waiting for our Dunkirk moment, for someone to come rescue us so that we can go attempt to help rescue the kids,” Nathaniel Raymond, the Executive Director of the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health, told CNN.
The Ukraine Conflict Observatory, an effort led by Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab, has collected more than three years of data following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with the backing of State Department funding. The effort was launched in May 2022 “to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.”
The database currently includes the information and identities of over 30,000 Ukrainian children who were allegedly abducted by Russia across 100 locations, explained a source familiar with the data. The initiative’s closure will leave a major blind spot because no other body has so closely tracked the abduction of Ukrainian children.
The lab’s work has supported six International Criminal Court indictments against Russia, including two related to the abduction of children, Raymond said.
Earlier this year, the effort’s funding was cut off as part of Department of Government Efficiency cuts, which resulted in researchers at Yale losing access to the database. But the funding was reinstated for a short time by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to ensure that the data was transferred to the European Union’s law enforcement agency, Europol, so that it could be used as evidence in future war crimes cases.
The transfer to Europol is expected to happen within hours or days now that the data and evidence of the alleged war crimes – including attacks on energy infrastructure, filtration sites, and attacks on civilian infrastructure – has been finalized for the time being by researchers at Yale and shared with the State Department, the source said.
CNN has asked the State Department for comment.
The scramble to keep the program alive has unleashed new efforts by a wide variety of individuals who are looking for private funding that could keep the effort alive.
Members of Congress defended the observatory’s work and its necessity earlier this year and sent another letter to Rubio on Wednesday urging the administration to restore funding.
“Research must continue unabated to maintain the rigorous process of identifying every Ukrainian child abducted by Russia. The Conflict Observatory has verified that at least 19,500 children have been forcibly deported from occupied areas of Ukraine, funneled into reeducation camps or adopted by Russian families, and their identities erased,” wrote a bipartisan group of House members, including Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett.
“The Conflict Observatory’s work cannot be replaced by Europol or other organizations, none of whom have access to specific resources that have made the Observatory’s work so successful,” the letter said.
Congressional offices have learned that the State Department notified Congress late last year of their intent to disperse about $8 million in funding for the program, congressional aides said. They are trying to find out if that money has been reprogrammed or could still be allocated to the effort, they added.
That funding question was raised to Rubio in a second letter from members of Congress that they planned to send on Wednesday evening.
“Although we do not believe this to be your intent, we fear that withholding these funds could appear to be a betrayal of the thousands of innocent children from Ukraine,” wrote Democratic Congressman Greg Landsman and a group of colleagues.
The letter goes on to ask if there is “a plan to disburse this funding to the Ukraine Conflict Observatory in accordance with the congressional notification.”
Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia began prisoner swaps this week, with Ukrainian soldiers who have spent nearly the entire duration of the war in captivity among those returning home. But efforts to secure an end to the war appear out of reach for the time being. And without future data from the initiative – which is sourced from satellite imagery and biometric data – efforts to secure the release of Ukrainian children captured in the future could be severely hampered.
“The Conflict Observatory has verified that at least 19,500 children have been forcibly deported from occupied areas of Ukraine, funneled into reeducation camps or adopted by Russian families, and their identities erased. The actual number of children remaining in Russia is presumably significantly higher, with a Russian official stating in July 2023 that Russia had brought 700,000 children from conflict zones in Ukraine to Russia,” the first congressional letter said.
There are also many children who have already been abducted who have yet to be identified “due to the Kremlin changing their names, place of birth, and date of birth,” the members wrote.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/10/world/europe-new-sanctions-russia-strength-intl,"Europe heaps harsh sanctions on Russia, saying ‘strength is the only language’ Moscow understands",2025-06-10 16:26:57,"The European Union announced a new package of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, saying that Moscow’s daily deadly attacks against Ukraine show that it is not interested in peace – despite recent diplomatic efforts.
The new package – the 18th since Russia launched its full-scale unprovoked invasion against its neighbor in 2022 – is designed to further target the Kremlin’s ability to make money from its oil and gas production.
The proposal includes lowering the price cap on Russian oil exports from $60 to $45 per barrel and introducing a full transaction ban on Russian banks and financial institutions in third countries that help Russia circumvent existing sanctions.
The EU said it is also proposing a ban on the use of Russian energy infrastructure, forbidding any EU operator from engaging directly or indirectly in any transactions that involve the Nord Stream pipelines.
The new package will need to be approved by the EU’s 27 member states. That could be complicated given previous concerns raised by some more pro-Kremlin governments, such as Hungary and Slovakia, about further sanctions targeting Russia.
While both those countries have previously threatened to block new rounds of sanctions, so far they have ultimately voted in favor of them.
The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions were necessary “because strength is the only language that Russia will understand.”
“We want peace for Ukraine. Despite weeks of diplomatic attempts, despite (Ukraine’s) President (Volodymyr) Zelensky’s offer of an unconditional ceasefire, Russia continues to bring death and destruction to Ukraine. Russia’s goal is not peace, it is to impose the rule of might. Therefore, we are ramping up pressure on Russia,” von der Leyen said at a news conference in Brussels.
The leaders of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Poland last month told Russian leader Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day ceasefire or face possible “massive” sanctions. Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing instead “direct talks” between Moscow and Kyiv.
But two rounds of talks in Istanbul, Turkey, have made it clear Russia is sticking to its maximalist demands that would essentially equate to Ukraine’s capitulation.
“Russia’s ability to continue the war is equal to its ability to sell their oil and bypass financial barriers,” Zelensky said Tuesday night, calling the European sanctions package “an important step” and also condemning the lack of similar measures from the United States.
“Russia has been constantly increasing the number of munitions in its strikes. This is a steady trend, and it means that Moscow is not afraid of anyone in the world,” the Ukrainian leader added.
“Putin wants to continue killing and is taking advantage of the fact that he is not getting a strong response. He does not hear Washington. And this speaks volumes to the world, to everyone.”
Targeting Russian energy
Explaining why the EU has targeted Russia’s energy sector, the Commission chief said oil exports still represent one third of Russian government revenues.
“We need to cut this source of revenue,” she said.
The oil price cap was introduced by the EU and G7 countries in December 2022.
The cap, which applies to Russia’s seaborne oil exports, prohibits Western companies from providing shipping, insurance and other services needed to export the fuel unless it is priced below the threshold.
By enforcing a price cap, the EU and its allies have tried to diminish a key source of revenue for the Kremlin while still allowing its oil to flow to the global energy market – because cutting Russia’s supplies completely could destabilize the market and cause prices to shoot up.
Von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the price cap needs lowering because global oil prices had fallen since the cap was first introduced and now trade “very close” to the $60 level.
The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has dropped 18% since the price cap on Russian crude took effect on December 5, 2022. It was trading at almost $68 a barrel late morning Eastern Time (ET) on Tuesday.
The bloc also wants to harden sanctions on Russia’s banking sector. Shortly after the invasion, the United States, EU, Britain and Canada jointly banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging service – a high-security network connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world. That has made it far more difficult for those banks to send and receive money from abroad.
Now, the Commission wants to go a step further and prevent any EU operator, such a a business, from conducting a transaction with a list of sanctioned Russian banks. It also plans to add another 22 of Moscow’s banks to that list. Additionally, the bloc wants to extend the transaction ban to financial institutions in third countries that help Russia circumvent existing sanctions.
Von der Leyen said the latest package of sanctions will also broaden the current ban on materials and technologies that can be exported to Russia, adding: “We want to make sure that Russia does not find ways to modernize its weapons with European technologies.”
The sanctions will also include new measures against 22 Russian and foreign companies providing direct or indirect support to Russia’s military and industrial complex.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
Russia’s war on Ukraine may be entering a pivotal moment.
President Donald Trump, who CNN reported Friday has been surprised and frustrated at the difficulty of achieving his promise of ending the war, wants Ukraine to give up territory in exchange for peace and essentially cede control of Crimea, the peninsula Russia first invaded in 2014.
Russia controls nearly 20% of Ukraine, much of which could be lost under the current US proposal.
The US is considering recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, even though its seizure was against international law.
All Russian President Vladimir Putin has to do, in Trump’s thinking, is stop fighting, leaving Putin richly rewarded for invading Ukraine if he is able to officially keep so much territory. If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky won’t budge, the US has threatened to withdraw support for Ukraine.
What’s been happening?
Trump’s top emissary, Steve Witkoff, met in person with Putin Friday in Moscow.
Ukrainians have been in talks with Americans and Europeans in London, pursuing their version of a plan, in which a ceasefire would come before any discussion of ceding territory.
Trump and Zelensky will both be at the Pope’s funeral in Rome over the weekend.
Whether there will be a breakthrough for peace, the entire two-tracked process blows up, or inertia sets in and the war continues could become clear in the coming days.
Meanwhile, hostilities continue. A Russian general was killed in a car bomb near Moscow Friday. Russian strikes are still targeting Ukraine’s cities, despite Trump’s admonition to Putin on social media, “Vladimir STOP.”
Will Ukraine give up on Crimea?
Trump thinks so.
“Crimea will stay with Russia,” he told Time on April 22. “And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time,” Trump said.
Russia first invaded Crimea in 2014 but despite moral outrage and sanctions, it did not face other consequences like it did later when it tried to invade the rest of Ukraine in 2022. Trump’s proposal for a cease fire seems to start with the idea that Crimea will be controlled by Russia.
Zelensky has publicly rejected the idea of ceding Crimea.
But other key Ukrainians seem to be open to the idea. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former champion boxer, told the BBC he is not involved in negotiations but that giving up Crimea might be necessary.
“It’s not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary,” Klitschko said.
Would a Crimea concession lead to a peace plan?
Washington Post columnist David Ignatius argues that if the two sides can get past the Crimea issue, other details could be worked out, including whether European troops will backstop Ukraine’s security, and whether the US will have a presence, perhaps securing and running a nuclear power plant.
CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh isn’t so sure, in large part because it’s not at all clear what Trump wants from Putin and whether Putin will give anything up. He writes:
The overriding problem is Putin thinks time is on his side and Trump has repeatedly said the clock is ticking. These two contrasting positions will not yield a lasting deal. The Kremlin has perhaps wisely ascertained it can, over months, hive off tiny concessions from the White House, and slowly build a geopolitical picture that is more in its favour. Consider the first 90 days of Trump’s presidency and how far the world has already changed in Moscow’s favour.
What’s wrong with the US recognizing Crimea as part of Russia?
Russia violated international law by invading Crimea, as CNN’s Ivana Kottosová writes. Zelensky has so far rejected the idea of ceding Crimea, noting that to do so would violate Ukraine’s Constitution.
If the US were to recognize Crimea as Russian, it would break America’s word multiple times over.
From Kottosová’s report:
Recognizing Crimea as part of Russia would put the Trump administration in breach of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the US made a commitment to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders, in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons.
In 2018, during the first Trump administration, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement reaffirming the US’ refusal to recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sovereignty over Crimea.
What does it mean if Putin is able to keep Crimea?
“That means that he has basically upended the international order,” retired Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, said on CNN Friday. “In essence, what he’s done is created a situation where we go back to the 19th century, where might makes right, and that is what he wants,” Leighton said, comparing Putin’s actions to the invasion by Nazi Germany of Czechoslovakia in the 1930s.
Ukrainians feel Crimea has been part of their country since the fall of the Soviet Union. In the decade-plus since Russia seized it Putin has worked to “Russify” Crimea. There are also resource considerations since Crimea and other contested portions of Ukraine are rich in oil, natural gas and other resources. Finally, Crimea sits on the Black Sea and offers important strategic advantages to Russia.
What if Zelensky won’t budge and the US, as it has threatened, walks away?
“What ‘walk away’ means is still a question that no one has really clear insight to,” according to Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former US Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia.
“Does it just mean that the United States will no longer be engaged in the diplomatic process in trying to end the war? Or does it mean that the United States will actually pack up and go home entirely, including ending any remaining military aid?” she told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on CNN Max.
Would Ukraine still fight without US support?
Ukraine does rely on US support, particularly for air defenses and for intelligence. But it has also built up its own resources and leans on Europe.
“Ukrainians will not stop fighting if the United States packs up its bags and walks away,” Kendall-Taylor said.
It’s Ukrainian drones that are causing most of the casualties on Russian soldiers at this point, she said. Ukrainians are also producing longer-range drones that can strike within Russia, which means Ukraine may prefer to play for time to “convince Putin that he can’t stay in this conflict indefinitely.”
Does Putin have any incentive to end the war?
“Not a lot,” according to Kendall-Taylor. “And that’s exactly why we’ve seen such intransigence on his part in making any progress towards the war.”
“It’s really in his interest to continue with the foot dragging, to try to demonstrate that they (Russia) are playing along so that they can preserve the US-Russia relationship,” she said.
“(Putin’s) preferred outcome would be to preserve that relationship and get the United States to abandon Ukraine,” she said.
Will Europe fill a US void?
Michael Kimmage, a former State Department specialist on Russia and Ukraine who now directs the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center told me that it already seems unlikely the US Congress will approve more spending to help Ukraine and that Europe, particularly Germany, is moving to step into that void.
“This is profound,” he said of Germany’s pivot to prioritize security in its spending.
“In a way, Trump is radicalizing German foreign policy, and there’s a need to go as fast as possible in the direction of independence (from the US), he said.
“If Germany is going to spend a trillion dollars on defense in the next couple of years, a lot of that is going to go to go to Ukraine, or it’s going to be a backstop to supporting Ukraine.”
But that’s a pivot that will take time.
“It’s not as if the Germany can fill in on the in the short term for the United States, but it can balance out the erratic and basically anti-Ukraine nature of the Trump presidency,” he said.",['Zachary B. Wolf'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/18/europe/us-threat-peacemaking-ukraine-intl/index.html,How the US threat to ‘move on’ from peacemaking efforts in Ukraine could play out,2025-04-17 00:00:00,"The Trump administration’s patience with peacemaking for Ukraine, always painfully thin, now appears to be running out altogether.
“If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after meeting European and Ukrainian officials for talks in Paris.
For President Donald Trump, who swept into office convinced he possessed the skills to quickly end the gravest conflict in Europe since the World War II, there is immense frustration with the lack of progress.
“The President has spent 87 days at the highest level of this government repeatedly taking efforts to bring this war to an end,” Rubio added, as the bloodshed in the war zone continues unabated.
So what would to “move on” look like?
One option might be redouble US military support for Ukraine. Despite Trump’s efforts to court the Kremlin, or perhaps because of them, Russian intransigence has emerged as the main obstacle to peace, such as Moscow’s foot-dragging over Trump’s proposed 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine alone has agreed.
Admittedly, fresh deliveries of billions of dollars more of American arms to Ukraine may be an unpopular policy U-turn among some Trump supporters, but a newly invigorated Ukrainian push-back on the battlefield could encourage the Kremlin to reassess its negotiating position.
New, properly tough US sanctions on Russian oil and gas, and those who buy it, have also been touted as a potential means of applying maximum pressure on Moscow.
Problem is, forging a peace in Ukraine is just one of the agenda items in what Trump and the Kremlin see as a much broader, lucrative reconfiguration of US-Russian relations – involving energy deals, space exploration and mining contracts – which Trump may be reluctant to jeopardize.
Back in Paris, Rubio hinted at a possible second, more likely, option.
“It’s not our war. We didn’t start it. The United States has been helping Ukraine for the past three years and we want it to end, but it’s not our war,” Rubio stressed, alluding to the possibility that the US could simply walk away, leaving Ukraine and its European backers to face Russia alone.
That would pose a huge challenge, given Ukraine’s depleted resources and Europe’s dire unreadiness, currently, to bolster the front lines with sufficient military supplies of its own.
For the Kremlin, American disengagement is a double-edged sword. It may give its battered forces a freer hand in Ukraine, but it doesn’t necessarily deliver the win that Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, insists that he wants, instead dragging out the pain.
Russian troops, who are being killed and injured at an alarming rate, would continue to be fed into the brutal “meat grinder” of the Ukrainian front lines, increasing simmering social pressure on the Kremlin at home.
Pressure on the Russian economy, already weakened by war, would also increase. If there is no peace deal, there is unlikely to be any easing of the punitive international sanctions already straining fragile Russian finances.
Putin, bent on total victory, may regret passing up the extraordinary chance offered by Trump to end his disastrous Ukraine war and cut his country’s substantial losses.
The Trump administration insists it has not yet entirely given up – just hours after Rubio’s comment, Vice President JD Vance said the White House was “optimistic” it could still end the war – but is signalling that that point may be drawing close.
“We need to determine very quickly now, and I’m talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable,” Rubio said of peace in Ukraine before heading back to Washington.
The Kremlin is also engaging in the brinkmanship, its spokesman insisting “there are no contacts planned for this week, but, on the other hand, let’s say that the established contacts allow us to very, very quickly agree on such a conversation if necessary.”
There is, it seems, still a narrow scope for a face-saving, last minute breakthrough. But time and patience in Washington to end the war in Ukraine seems to be rapidly running out.",['Matthew Chance'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam/index.html,What message was Ukraine trying to send by parading Chinese nationals captured fighting for Russia?,2025-04-16 19:16:19,"Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.
But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.
There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.
China has always claimed neutrality in Russia’s war on Ukraine and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. All the same, as a key diplomatic and economic lifeline for Moscow, Beijing’s actions are watched closely in Kyiv.
Dressed in combat fatigues and answering questions in Mandarin, the POWs were watched over by armed Ukrainian security personnel, while a translator sat beside them.
The men – who CNN are not naming, nor identifying in any way – told how financial incentives played a key role in their stories.
One said he had been looking for a way to earn money after losing his job during the coronavirus pandemic. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.
As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.
Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood. One said that he communicated mainly through hand signals.
CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.
The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. Lasting a year, it commits the volunteer, among other things, to “participate in combat, fulfill duties during the mobilization period… emergencies and martial law,” as well as take part in “activity to keep and restore international peace and security” and stopping “international terrorist activity outside the territory of the Russian Federation.”
Once they reached the battlefield, instruction there was also non-verbal. One of the men recounted the chaotic moments that lead up to their capture in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. But I did not know where the target was. We passed many Russian positions, and I thought we were heading toward our own bunker. I thought he was joking, so I hid. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”
The men surrendered. They had been fighting for only three days.
The role of foreign fighters
Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.
A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.
In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.
A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.
“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.
Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.
Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.
“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”
But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.
The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.
One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.
It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.
It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.
Why the timing matters
Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.
The timing is important.
It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President Donald Trump, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.
Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.
From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.
But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.
Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.
“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.
“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.
Beijing certainly saw it like that.
“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.","['Andrew Carey', 'Victoria Butenko']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/14/europe/ukraine-sumy-trump-russia-intl/index.html,Trump calls Sumy missile strike a ‘mistake.’ But Russia’s war seems to be raging on exactly to Putin’s plan,2025-04-14 14:46:31,"“I was told they made a mistake.” This is the way US President Donald Trump characterized Russia’s “horrific” double-tap missile strike on central Sumy, Ukraine, on Saturday, which allegedly used cluster munitions to maximize casualties.
The Iskander missiles reportedly utilized are accurate, and the use of two of them could suggest a degree of purpose and malice, aimed at hitting first responders too as they rush in. It is unlikely the Kremlin saw the error of its ways - this tactic being now so common - and perhaps a sympathizer is instead excusing Russia to the US president.
The weekend’s strike was, to Ukraine’s allies, a gruesome reminder of Moscow’s true intent in its invasion: to terrify Ukrainians into submission. The target, Sumy, is also in Russia’s immediate crosshairs, as President Vladimir Putin claims to seek a buffer zone inside of Ukraine by pounding this thriving border city.
The attack also placed unwelcome emphasis on just how little fruit the White House’s relentless pursuit of diplomacy has borne. Trump said Friday on social media that Russia had to “get moving,” but provided no deadlines or explicit consequences if it did not, although secondary tariffs on its oil purchasers have been floated.
Trump has made similar comments before – admonishing Moscow for its onslaught on Ukraine’s civilians, while also expressing broader grief at the tragedy of war in general, rather than fury at the Kremlin’s specific massacres, say of nine children at a Kryvyi Rih playground days earlier.
Indeed, he later reached for what seems to be his comfort talking points. When seemingly cornered on the issue, Trump suggested - erroneously - Ukraine had in fact started the war. “Listen, when you start a war, you gotta know that you can win the war, right? You don’t start a war with someone who’s 20 times your size and then hope people give you some missiles,” he said, answering a question about Kyiv’s urgent requests for more Patriot missile defense systems.
The truth Trump may be reluctant to post about is that Russia’s diplomacy has predictably dissolved into a dizzying Catherine wheel of tangents. It generates the requisite light and noise, but is of little consequence, bar Moscow continuing to buy time and prosecute the war on its own terms.
American and Russian diplomats are now on a carousel of Moscow’s apparent design, with multiple tracks leaving scant chance of real progress. Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff intermittently flies to Russia, to presumably hear demands direct from the Kremlin, whose official called his Friday visit to St Petersburg “productive.” Higher-level American and Russian diplomats meet in Saudi Arabia to float ceasefire ideas and a wider detente, while lower-level diplomatic meetings began in the new venue of Turkey last week to address the technical details of embassies reopening.
And there is more. The Americans and Ukrainians have been hammering out in Washington a viable way forward from a dense and corporate rare-earth minerals contract, drawn up (and perhaps only understood) by Delaware corporate lawyers, which seems, according to the last draft seen by CNN, to be almost entirely in the White House’s favor.
And there is a separate diplomatic US-Ukraine track over peace, also in Saudi Arabia, that has so far proposed a wide-ranging ceasefire that Russia has yet to agree to. Instead, a limited 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire – chaotically birthed and barely adhered to – ends on Friday. This first test of diplomacy, seemingly dead on arrival, is somehow yet to cast future endeavors as problematic.
The above flow chart, or lapsed Venn diagram, has the singular unifying thread of the Trump administration seeking progress from multiple different dialogues it hopes will eventually congeal into a singular lasting peace. Five different, current conversations, and that is even if you don’t count the mostly silent role of Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia Gen. Keith Kellogg, or the intermittent but overarching influence that Putin-Trump phone calls take.
This disparate and confusing interface is, Moscow’s critics say, a standard Russian tactic to buy time while appearing engaged. The Trump administration brimmed with 24-hour to 100-day deadlines about peace prior to the rubber hitting the road. Now there is no deadline – or end to the metastasizing talks – in sight.
Why does Putin seek time? Because he believes Trump has been proven to be easily distracted and is interested in an easy win, but not a complex compromise. Putin also clearly believes this summer he can win a tangible victory on the front lines that will change the dynamic in talks.
His onslaught on Sumy is intended to buy Russia space on the border, but also drag Ukraine’s forces in. Russia is making slow yet discomforting progress to the south of Zaporizhzhia, an area where nearly two years ago its counteroffensive was meant to have broken through. One Ukrainian intelligence officer recently moved to near the city of Kharkiv described a front line quieter than expected, and anxiety as to what lies ahead.
Concerns are growing that Russia is amassing reinforcements, waiting for the ground to dry in May to escalate a spring offensive that Ukrainian officials say has already partially begun. Kyiv has hinted at an artillery ammunition shortage in the weeks ahead, and recent pledges by its allies may not have headed off that imminent crisis. It is going to be a very difficult summer for Ukraine.
This is the real rubber hitting the road. Moscow has invested all in a war in which it simply cannot afford anything less than victory. It does not see gain in forging a deal over frozen front lines now. The momentum – with a White House tearing up economic and security norms by the sheaf, and Ukraine struggling to meet manpower and resource needs – is day by day more in its favor. The Russians are stalling for time as they believe it is on their side.
Their European allies are disconcertingly readying for two unpleasant potential futures. The first is the possibility of a Ukrainian collapse and the need for NATO’s European members to hold back the Russians without American assistance. This is a more remote likelihood, but the undertone of preparations across the continent. The second possibility is more feasible and public: the British and French are spearheading preparations for a “reassurance force” to protect any ceasefire. The noise, and planning, serves two purposes: it allows Kyiv to agree to diplomacy knowing it has some security guarantees in place. And it partially embarrasses Moscow into stonewalling a peace plan that is increasingly ready to roll.
But with each rotation of the diplomatic Catherine wheel, the terms of actual peace become more dizzying. Putin seems less willing to offer even a partial pause as he believes ultimately Trump is toothless and will not punish him effectively for refusing this détente.
Trump said of US talks with Russia and Ukraine at the weekend: “You know, there’s a point at which you have to either put up or shut up.” His problem is that both he and the Kremlin are happy to keep talking. And neither wants to put up either: Trump is reluctant to impose harsh sanctions and disrupt his relationship with Moscow, and the Kremlin seems to have no desire to stop the war.
Trump added: “We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s going fine.” Ukraine must be left hoping he does not mean simply that the country’s fate will be permanently eclipsed by another crisis.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/europe/russian-strike-sumy-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Russian strikes on Ukrainian city of Sumy kill 35, in deadliest attack this year",2025-04-13 00:00:00,"Russian ballistic missiles ripped through the busy center of Ukraine’s northeastern city of Sumy on Sunday, officials said, killing at least 35 people and striking terror into residents who were out enjoying Palm Sunday and attending morning church services.
It was the deadliest attack of the conflict this year. Two children were among the scores of people killed in the strikes on the city’s center, while 117 people were wounded, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the strikes were carried out by ballistic missiles; one hit a university building and another “exploded right over (a) street,” he said.
Zelensky also called for a “strong response from the world” to the attack, which came two days after top Trump administration official Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, with video showing the two warmly shaking hands before a four hour meeting.
Ukrainian officials said that preliminary information indicates cluster munitions were used in the attack. The second of the two explosions was described as being likely filled with munitions that “exploded mid-air to inflict maximum damage on people,” according to the head of the region’s military administration.
“Russia wants exactly this kind of terror and is dragging out this war,” Zelensky said. “Without pressure on the aggressor, peace is impossible. Talking has never stopped ballistic missiles and bombs. We need to treat Russia as a terrorist deserves.”
When asked about the attack, Moscow maintained that the Russian military “strikes exclusively at military and near-military targets.”
“I can only repeat and remind you of the repeated statements of both our president (Vladimir Putin) and our army representatives,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.
The attacks targeted Ukrainian commanding officers, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said on Telegram. It claimed that Kyiv “continues to use the Ukrainian population as a human shield” by “holding events with the participation of military personnel in the center of a densely populated city.”
International condemnation of the strikes from Ukraine’s allies was swift.
The Trump administration’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg questioned the targeting of the attack, which he said “crosses any line of decency.”
US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said he was told Russia “made a mistake.”
“I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it’s a horrible thing,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday. When asked to elaborate on Monday, Trump said: “the mistake was letting the war happen.”
While he acknowledged that Putin started the war against Ukraine, he also continued to cast blame on Zelensky and former US President Joe Biden. “When you start a war you got to know that you can win the war,” Trump said referring to Zelensky. “You don’t start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles.”
Strikes on Palm Sunday
The strikes hit the city center on Palm Sunday as residents were attending church services on one of the busiest church-going days of the year, according to Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko.
Natalia Pihul, a 52-year-old Sumy resident, told Reuters that her mother was hospitalized after suffering a head injury.
“(My mother) was in the kitchen cooking some food, lunch … A cupboard was right here, now it lies here on the floor. It fell and its doors cut her head,” she said as she walked around her mother’s damaged apartment.
The explosion blew out the unit’s window frames, scattering glass shards all across the kitchen and living room. Outside the building, footage from Reuters showed charred vehicles next to piles of rubble and personal belongings littering the street.
“Where is a military base here? Where is it? Please have a look. A woman lived here. Look at this! How is this even possible? It is unacceptable,” Pihul said.
A total of 20 buildings were damaged, including apartments, cafes, shops and the district court, Zelensky later wrote on X.
Of the more than 100 people wounded in the attack, he said 68 were in hospitals, eight of whom were in serious condition.
Volodymyr Artyukh, head of the military administration in the region, said that “at that time, a lot of people were on the street.”
“The enemy was hoping to inflict the greatest damage on people in the city of Sumy,” Artyuk added.
The attack is also the worst single attack on Ukrainian civilians since 2023, when 51 people were killed in strikes on Kupiansk.
Footage from the scene shows destroyed buildings, blown-out windows and piles of rubble in the Sumy city center. Bodies covered in emergency blankets can be seen on the ground.
Cluster munitions used, say Ukrainian officials
Cluster munitions contain multiple explosives that are released over a wide area – up to the size of several football fields – and are particularly dangerous to civilians when fired near populated areas.
“A missile with cluster munitions is something Russians do to kill as many civilians as possible,” said Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, calling the strike a “deliberate targeting of civilians.”
It was a two-pronged attack, with the second of two missiles likely filled with munitions that “exploded mid-air to inflict maximum damage on people” and caused large numbers of casualties, the head of the region’s military administration said. The second explosion happened about 200 meters from the site of the first, hitting an area with residential buildings, educational institutions and shops.
Sumy resident Iryna Pryykhodko told Reuters that the “first explosion was strong, but the second one was even stronger.”
“First, I saw shattered windows. Then, before the second strike, we took cover inside the residential building,” she said. “After the second strike, it was all covered with smoke and I could not see anything.”
Among those killed was Olena Kohut, an artist with the Sumy National Theatre’s orchestra, who died from her injuries in the attack. Liudmyla Hordiienko, a deputy head in the region’s state tax service, was also killed.
CNN has verified social media videos of the moment the strike hit Sumy. A loud noise can be heard as large plumes of black smoke rise in the air.
Video shared by the region’s military administration also registers a loud boom, showing the moment a Russian missile hit a building. Emergency sirens can be heard as people run in panic, while others can be seen lying on the ground.
The face of one woman being helped is covered in blood in a different video shared by Zelensky. Footage also shows body bags on the ground and a blown-out trolleybus that appears to have bodies inside, as emergency workers respond to the attack.
Artyukh, the head of the military administration, later said that most people on the trolleybus were killed.
Global condemnation
Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, called the incident a “horrific example of Russia intensifying attacks while Ukraine has accepted an unconditional ceasefire.” French President Emmanuel Macron also reacted, saying “strong measures” are needed to impose a ceasefire.
“It’s been two months since Putin ignored America’s proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire,” Zelensky said Sunday, referring to Ukraine’s acceptance of a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States in March, which Russia refused.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio extended condolences to victims of the “horrifying Russian missile attack.”
Speaking to CBS News’ “60 Minutes” in an interview published Sunday, Zelensky said he believes that “Russian narratives are prevailing in the US.”
“How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians are doing, and to still believe that they are not the aggressors, that they did not start this war?” he said.
“This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia’s information policy on America, on US politics, and US politicians.”
The UN’s Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine Matthias Schmale condemned the strike on Sumy’s city center “in the strongest possible terms” and noted that international humanitarian law “strictly prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure.”
Russia has increased air attacks and missile strikes on the Sumy region in recent weeks as it has pushed Ukrainian forces out of much of the adjoining Russian territory of Kursk. Its forces have also occupied a few small settlements just inside the Sumy region.
Over the past 24 hours, other Russian attacks in Ukraine’s Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kherson regions killed eight people and wounded at least 18.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/world/ukraine-life-under-russian-occupation-trumps-peace-talks/index.html,Ukrainians living under Russian occupation fear Trump’s peace talks,2025-04-07 00:00:00,"Asked why she and other Ukrainian people choose to keep living under Russian occupation instead of fleeing, the woman paused for a moment.
“I don’t know how to explain the feeling,” she said. “It’s like you just can’t believe that evil could win. Even after three years, people can’t believe that this is it. They still believe that the occupation will end. That’s why they are still staying here and not running away.”
The woman, a member of the all-female resistance group Zla Mavka, lives in a city in southeastern Ukraine that fell under Russian control just days after Moscow launched its full-scale, unprovoked invasion of the country in February 2022.
Zla Mavka – which translates as Angry Mavka, Mavka being a female forest spirit in Ukrainian folklore – engages only in non-violent activities. But taking part in any form of protest and speaking to Western media is extremely dangerous, which is why CNN is not publishing the woman’s name or location.
She told CNN that life under Russian occupation is exhausting and incredibly scary.
“You can be arrested for anything. You have to worry about everything. You have to check your phone, you have to check what you have in your apartment, you have to hide a lot of things, you can’t say what you’re thinking and you cannot trust anyone,” she said.
US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he wants the war in Ukraine to end, even if it means further territorial losses for Kyiv. Trump has said it was “unlikely” Ukraine would get all of its pre-war territory back, saying: “(Russia) took a lot of land, and they fought for that land, and they lost a lot of soldiers.”
This could include the Zla Mavka woman’s hometown.
“People abroad always talk about territories, and they forget, maybe, that it’s not only about territories. It’s about people. And people here are still waiting. People have not moved, and they don’t want to move. And why (should) they have to move from their homes?” the woman said.
Russian forces currently occupy nearly a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, home to about 6 million people, including 1 million children, who are living in what the United Nations has described as a “bleak human rights situation.”
Stepan, a 22-year-old Ukrainian man who recently escaped from an occupied area in southern Ukraine to Kherson, which is under Kyiv’s control, has experienced firsthand what the occupying forces are capable of.
Stepan and his parents were detained by Russian troops in summer 2022. He was held for two weeks and repeatedly beaten and tortured with electricity. His parents were held for several more months.
None of the family was ever told why they were being detained. They have never been convicted or charged with any crimes.
When Stepan was released, he was separated from the rest of his family. He ended up on the left bank of the Dnipro River, which is still occupied by Russia. His mother Olha managed to escape to a government-controlled area after she was released in spring 2023.
“I was very afraid,” Stepan said of his time living under occupation. “Whenever I went outside, I looked around to see if they were there to take me away again or do something to me. I wouldn’t leave the house if I didn’t have to. It was like that every day,” he told CNN.
Stepan was lucky – he managed to escape and was reunited with his family last month. He was brought back thanks to a “coordinated effort” that involved the “Angels,” a Ukrainian special forces unit that rescues vulnerable people from occupied territories, according to Roman Mrochko, the head of Kherson City Military Administration. Stepan and his family said they were not allowed to share details of the operation.
Dire consequences
Both Stepan and the Zla Mavka member said that even the slightest suspicion of being “pro-Ukrainian” can have dire consequences for people living under occupation.
“My friends and acquaintances were often taken away because they did not want to get a Russian passport or for not registering for military service. They were taken away and brought back a week later with broken arms and legs, sometime heads. There were many, we are talking about dozens of people,” Stepan said.
Human rights groups say that Moscow has intensified its campaign to “Russify” occupied Ukraine in recent months, likely to stake claim to the areas in any future peace negotiation.
“They try to remove anything Ukrainian from our city, from the language to traditions,” the Zla Mavka woman said, adding that the group has made it one of its missions to keep Ukrainian culture alive under occupation.
“We are spreading Ukrainian poems and the works of Ukrainian authors, and (celebrating) Ukrainian holidays, the traditional ones, just to remind to everybody that this is not Russia, and never was, and never will be,” she said.
She described living in the city like “getting into a time machine and going back to the USSR.”
“There’s propaganda and Soviet-style monuments, and Soviet holidays, and we are always waiting in lines, like in Soviet times, to get help, or to go to the doctor, or to get some documents, you have to wait in these long lines and there are no normal shops and no brands… just stuff you can get in the street markets and some strange Chinese products.”
Russian authorities have been meticulously erasing Ukrainian national identity, religion and language in occupied Ukraine. They have staged sham referenda on joining Russia and have been forcing the local population to become Russian citizens.
Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new decree ordering Ukrainian citizens living in these areas to “regulate their legal status” by adopting Russian citizenship. According to the decree, those who don’t do so by September will become foreigners and will only be allowed to stay for limited time.
But Moscow has already effectively coerced many Ukrainian people into accepting Russian passports because life is nearly impossible and very dangerous without them.
Those who don’t have Russian documents face the daily threat of arrest and deportation to Russia, have no right to work, no access to even the most basic health services or pensions and are barred from owning property.
“You can’t even call an ambulance without (a Russian passport). If you don’t have a Russian passport, the ambulance will not come,” the resistance woman said.
Human rights watchdogs have repeatedly said that Moscow is breaking international law by forcing the Ukrainian population to adopt Russian passports.
“And then the big problem for men, the men who (were forced to get) Russian passports, they are now trying to mobilize them into the Russian Army. They want to force them to fight against their own people,” the woman added.
The risk of trying to leave
Millions of Ukrainians are refusing to leave their homes in occupied territories – most because they still believe that Kyiv, with the help of its Western allies, will eventually liberate all its land.
There are also some who sympathize with Russia and are happy with the new regime – although both the Zla Mavka woman and Stepan said they believe this is only a small minority.
“These are often people who did not have a very good life before. For example, they didn’t have education and didn’t have a good job, but now, if they cry out loud ‘I love Russia,’ they will get a job in the government, they will get help and money from Russia,” the Zla Mavka member said.
SOS Donbas, a Ukrainian helpline for people living in occupied territories and combat zones, received more than 57,500 calls last year. Violeta Artemchuk, the director of the organization, said most people are asking for advice on how to leave safely, how to access help and what the implications are of staying and being forced to take a Russian passport.
The Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly told people in occupied areas to do whatever they need to stay safe.
“If you need to get some documents, get them. This does not change your status,” Heorhii Tykhyi, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said after the decree requiring Ukrainians in occupied territories to become Russian citizens was announced.
Tykhyi said that “the best solution, if possible, is to leave for the controlled territory of Ukraine.”
But for many, leaving is impossible because it’s too dangerous, too expensive and too treacherous.
“Theoretically, it’s possible to leave, but you have to go through filtration,” the Zla Mavka woman said, referring to a security screening process conducted by Russian forces on all exits from the occupied areas.
“They’re checking everything there, so… let’s say there is a woman whose husband was a soldier in 2014, and if they find out, she will have a huge problem, so for her, it is safer not to try. But this could be anything, like a comment on social media, something on your phone, they can just arrest you and deport you to Russia,” she said.
Thousands of Ukrainian citizens have been illegally detained and sent to Russia, and CNN has documented cases of people who were picked up at Russian filtration points and subsequently sent to facilities thousands of miles away from Ukraine.
It is impossible to cross directly from occupied Ukraine into government-controlled areas, which means that anyone wishing to flee must travel through Russia, get out of Russia and then travel through Europe back to Ukraine.
“It’s not easy to leave everything and become a refugee. You can’t sell your apartment, you cannot cross the border with a large amount of money, you can’t take much… so it is possible, but not for everyone,” the woman said.
So, for now, she and millions of others are staying and watching the news coming from the White House and elsewhere in horror.
“People are very nervous and they’re very afraid to hear about a negotiation, and how our cities will become Russia, this is the biggest fear. But I can tell you that even if this happens, resistance won’t stop.”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en

Ukraine said all of them went into exile voluntarily, as part of a government scheme that gives anyone convicted of collaborating with Russia the option of being sent there.
But human rights groups and international lawyers say the scheme is problematic, contradicts previous statements made by the Ukrainian government, and could potentially put more people at risk of being snatched by the Russians.
“I completely understand the sentiment, we all want the people (who are detained in Russia) to be released as quickly as possible and Russia has no will to do that… but the solution that is offered is definitely not the right one,” said Onysiia Syniuk, a legal analyst at Zmina, a Ukrainian human rights group.
The program, called “I want to go to my own,” was launched last year by Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, the Ministry of Defense, the Security Service and the parliament’s Commissioner for Human Rights.
A government website outlining the program includes photos and personal information of some of the 300 Ukrainian people that the government says have signed up to the program.
The profiles of 31 of them are stamped with a picture of a suitcase and the words “HAS LEFT,” with a note saying he or she “left for Russia while at the same time real Ukrainians returned home.”
Bargaining chips
According to Kyiv, at least 16,000 Ukrainian civilians are known to be detained in Russia, although the real number is likely to be much higher. Some 37,000 Ukrainians, including civilians, children and members of the military, are officially recognized as missing.
Many have been detained in occupied territories, detained for months or even years without any charges or trial, and deported to Russia. They include activists, journalists, priests, politicians and community leaders as well as people who appear to have been snatched by Russian troops at random at checkpoints and other places in occupied Ukraine.
The detention of civilians by an occupying power is illegal under international laws of conflict, except for in a few narrowly defined situations and with strict time limits.
Because of that, there is no established legal framework for the treatment and exchange of civilian detainees in the same way there is for prisoners of war.
Russia has, in some cases, claimed that the Ukrainian civilians it is holding are prisoners of war and should be recognized as such by Ukraine. Kyiv has been reluctant to do so because it could put civilians living in occupied areas of Ukraine at risk of being arbitrarily detained by Russia as it seeks to grow its pool for future exchanges.
Ukraine’s human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets told CNN last year that Kyiv believes Russia has been taking Ukrainians hostage to use them as bargaining chips, and that he rejected the idea of exchanging civilians as part of a prisoner swap.
Kyiv has rallied its allies to increase pressure on Russia over the issue and tried to get Moscow to agree to release the detained civilians through third countries, similar to the way some Ukrainian children have been returned with the help of Qatar, South Africa and the Vatican.
Several international organizations, including the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), have also repeatedly called on Moscow to unconditionally release its civilian detainees.
Russia has ignored the pleas.
The “I want to go to my own” program is an attempt by Kyiv to get some of the detained civilians back without having to recognize them as prisoners of war.
But human rights groups are urging the Ukrainian government to continue to press for unconditional release of civilians. “Under international humanitarian law, it is not possible to talk about exchanging civilians. All civilians unlawfully detained must be released unconditionally,” said Yulia Gorbunova, a senior researcher on Ukraine at Human Rights Watch (HRW).
“But in practice, things are a lot more difficult because Russia is not playing by the rules. For Ukrainian civilians, to be included on an exchange list is their main hope. I think the scheme is an attempt to find a way to do this,” she told CNN.
Announcing the 1,000 for 1,000 exchange, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky hinted as much.
“I would like to thank our law enforcement officers today for adding Russian saboteurs and collaborators to the exchange fund,” the president said, while also thanking Ukrainian soldiers for capturing Russian troops on the front lines.
‘Political prisoners’
But it seems that the scheme did not yield the results Kyiv was hoping for.
Petro Yatsenko from the Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War told CNN Ukraine did not know ahead of the time who was being returned.
The headquarters said the returnees included a group of at least 60 Ukrainian civilians who were convicted of criminal offenses unrelated to the war.
The headquarters’ deputy head, Andriy Yusov, told CNN many of them had been convicted by Ukrainian courts and were serving sentences in Ukrainian prisons when Russia launched its full-scale, unprovoked invasion in February 2022 and occupied the areas where they were detained.
After completing their sentences, Russian authorities were supposed to deport these prisoners from the occupied territories back to Ukraine. Instead, it kept them, unlawfully, in detention centers normally used for illegal immigrants and only released them as part of the 1,000 for 1,000 prisoner swap.
The RussianHuman Rights Commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova described the convicted Ukrainian collaborators sent to Russia as “political prisoners,” but did not give any more details on who they were or what would happen to them next.
Moskalkova’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
The “I want to go to my own” website gives details of some those sent to Russia in the prisoner exchange, including the offenses they were convicted of. Many were serving years-long sentences for collaboration with Moscow. Some were convicted of supporting the invasion or sharing information with Russian troops. Most received sentences of between five and eight years in prison.
But human rights lawyers say the Ukrainian collaboration law under which these people were sentenced is itself problematic.
HRW has previously issued an extensive report criticizing the anti-collaboration law, calling it flawed.
Gorbunova said the group analyzed close to 2,000 verdicts and that while there were genuine collaborators among them, a lot of them were “people who, under international humanitarian law, should not have been prosecuted.”
She said these included cases where there’s been “little or no harm done” and or where there was no intent to harm national security. Some of the cases involve people who had been working in public service in areas that were then occupied and who had simply continued doing their jobs.
“Helping people on the streets, people who are sick or have disabilities, distributing humanitarian aid. Teachers, firefighters, municipal workers who collect trash, that type of thing – they could be convicted of working for the occupation as collaborators,” she said.
“That is not to say that there are no actual collaborators who commit crimes against national security…who should be punished, (but) this legislation is so vague that essentially a very wide range of activities of people living and working under occupation could qualify as collaboration, which is troubling and problematic,” she said.
While the initiative’s website includes what it says are handwritten notes from each of the convicted collaborators indicating their wish to leave for Russia, human rights organizations say the way in which they have been disowned by their country is ethically dubious.
Syniuk told CNN: “These people are still Ukrainian citizens, and the wording that they have on the website is that they were exchanged for ‘real Ukrainians’– that is very … not okay.”",['Ivana Kottasová'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/europe/russia-strikes-kharkiv-ukraine-intl-hnk,"Kharkiv hit by ‘most powerful attack’ of entire war, mayor says, as Russia pounds Ukraine again",2025-06-07 00:00:00,"Massive Russian strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city killed at least five people on Saturday, officials said, one night after Moscow carried out one of the war’s largest aerial assaults on Ukraine.
Russia has conducted extensive attacks on Ukraine in recent days, in what is being viewed as retaliation for an audacious drone operation by Kyiv that debilitated more than a third of Moscow’s strategic cruise missile carriers.
The northeastern city of Kharkiv – which sits about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Russian border – was shaken by “at least 40 explosions” in the early hours of Saturday, according to a Telegram post by Mayor Igor Terekhov.
“Kharkiv is currently experiencing the most powerful attack since the start of the full-scale war,” Terekhov said. “The enemy is striking simultaneously with missiles, (drones) and guided aerial bombs. This is outright terror against peaceful Kharkiv.”
Video released by emergency services showed a large fire burning in a multi-story apartment block in the Osnovyanskyi district in the city’s southwest, where Terekhov said two people had died. One person was also killed in a strike that hit a house in the Kyivskyi district to the north, he said.
Russia resumed its assault on Saturday evening. It launched a fresh round of strikes using glide bombs, killing another two people and injuring at least 40 others, according to Ukrainian officials.
Those killed were a woman and 62-year-old man, officials said. Two other victims of the attack are in intensive care in “extremely serious condition,” according to Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration.
The target of the second attack was a children’s playground with a miniature railway, Terekhov said.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Saturday evening attack “pure terrorism” in a post on Telegram.
“Air bombs on civilians in the city – even a children’s railway nearby. This makes no military sense. Pure terrorism,” he said in the post. “This cannot be ignored. We cannot turn a blind eye to this… Every day we lose our people just because Russia feels impunity. We need tough pressure on Russia to make peace.”
In his daily address later Saturday, Zelensky said that “the Russians are preparing to continue the war and ignore all peace proposals. They must be held accountable for this.”
The Ukrainian leader also called on the United States to send “positive” and “specific signals” related to his country’s air defense. Kyiv has extended an offer to the US to buy air defense systems, Zelensky said, but it has not yet received a response.
Last week, the Pentagon notified Congress that it will be diverting critical anti-drone technology that had been allocated for Ukraine to US Air Force units in the Middle East, according to correspondence obtained by CNN and people familiar with the matter.
Russia said earlier Saturday that its forces carried out high-precision strikes overnight on Ukrainian military facilities. “The strikes achieved their objectives. All designated targets were destroyed,” the Russian Ministry of Defense posted on Telegram.
More than 50 drones, four guided aerial bombs and a missile were used in the attack which also damaged an administrative building and music school in the city, according to Kharkiv region prosecutor’s office.
Among the injured include a 14-year-old girl and a one-and-a-half-month-old boy, who is suffering from “acute stress,” the office added.
Ruslana Sheveleva, a Kharkiv resident whose neighbors’ house was struck in the attack, described the chaotic scenes as people scrambled to escape the building. “The house was hit, right where this young man was lying,” she told Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne.
“I don’t think he even understood what was happening. He died instantly. They dug his mother out from under the rubble. His father, as I understand it, managed to get out almost on his own,” she added.
Iryna Ivanenko, another resident, said her 26-year-old daughter – who was later rescued by firefighters – begged her for help, trapped in her bedroom under a heavy slab. “I tried to lift the slab, but it was impossible,” Ivanenko told Suspline.
Uncertainty over prisoner of war swap
Meanwhile, Russia accused Ukraine on Saturday of postponing the exchange of prisoners of war and transfer of deceased soldiers for an “indefinite” period.
“The Ukrainian side unexpectedly postponed the transfer of bodies and the exchange of prisoners of war for an indefinite period,” Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky posted on Telegram. “For some reason, their negotiating team didn’t even show up at the exchange point.”
An agreement to work towards another prisoner swap was reached in Istanbul on Monday during a second round of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials.
Medinsky – the head of Russia’s delegation for the talks in Istanbul – claimed Saturday that Moscow had given Ukraine a list of 640 wounded, seriously ill and young prisoners of war to be exchanged.
In addition, Russia has begun the repatriation of more than 6,000 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers, Medinsky said. “The first batch of 1,212 frozen bodies of Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers has already arrived in refrigerated trucks at the exchange point. The rest are on their way,” he said.
Ukraine accused Russia of playing “dirty games.”
“Today’s statements by the Russian side do not correspond to reality or to previous agreements on either the exchange of prisoners or the repatriation of bodies,” Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Saturday.
The authority said that Ukraine has submitted a list of seriously wounded, ill and young servicemen to be exchanged, but claimed that Russia’s lists “do not comply with the agreed approach.”
“Ukraine has provided relevant comments, and the next step is now awaited from the Russian side,” the authority said.
Commenting on the repatriation of soldiers’ bodies, the authority said that “an agreement has indeed been reached,” but added that no date has been set for the transfer to take place.
On Saturday evening, Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed governor of the occupied parts of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, said that Moscow would publish the names of the Ukrainian soldiers whose bodies were reportedly supposed to be returned that day.
In a post on Telegram, Balitsky accused Kyiv of not carrying out what it had previously agreed to do.
“What is there to discuss if Ukraine refuses to accept the bodies of its dead, the agreement about which was reached during the second stage of negotiations,” he asked.
Several swaps have previously taken place between the two sides despite the ongoing conflict.
Also on Saturday, Ukraine’s air force said that it had shot down a Russian Su-35 fighter jet as part of a “successful Air Force operation in the Kursk direction.”
Russia did not immediately comment on the claim, but a Russian military blogger described the plane as lost and said that the pilot had been rescued.
A day before the assualt on Kharkiv, in an apparent retaliation to Ukraine’s drone swarm, Russia launched a barrage of drones and ballistic missiles across broad swaths of Ukraine, killing at least six people and injuring dozens of others.
“They gave (Russian President Vladimir) Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night,” US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One late on Friday.
Trump had earlier warned Russian retaliation was imminent, after speaking with his Russian counterpart on Wednesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/europe/russia-launches-retaliatory-strike-on-kyiv-latam-hnk-intl,Russia launches one of war’s largest air attacks days after Ukraine’s bomber raid,2025-06-05 23:53:29,"Russia launched a barrage of drones and ballistic missiles across broad swaths of Ukraine early Friday, killing at least six people and injuring dozens of others, days after Kyiv launched a daring raid on Moscow’s fleet of strategic bombers.
For residents of Kyiv, the night’s soundtrack was familiar: the shrieking whir of drones, air raid sirens and large explosions overhead – whether from air defenses successfully downing missiles, or projectiles puncturing the capital.
Three firefighters were killed in Kyiv, two civilians were killed in Lutsk, and another person was killed in Chernihiv, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had used more than 400 drones and 40 missiles in the overnight attack, putting it among the war’s largest. He said Moscow’s attack injured 80 and targeted “almost all” of Ukraine, listing nine regions, from Lviv in the west to Sumy in the northeast.
Although Russia has pummeled Ukraine almost daily over three years of full-scale war, Ukrainians had been bracing for retaliation since Sunday, when Kyiv launched an audacious operation that struck more than a third of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers.
In a call with his US counterpart Donald Trump on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow would have to respond to Kyiv’s assault.
Speaking aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump told reporters Ukraine “gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night.”
Russia’s Ministry of Defense said its strikes were in response to what it called Kyiv’s “terrorist acts.” It was not immediately clear if the attack was the extent of Russia’s pledged retaliation, or if Putin intends to escalate further. After the embarrassment of Kyiv’s operation, there was a chorus of bellicose calls from pro-Kremlin pundits for a severe – potentially nuclear – response.
Although Ukrainians had been buoyed last weekend by the news of Kyiv’s successful operation, many were wary of how Russia might strike back. But after Friday’s strikes, Kyiv residents told CNN they supported Ukraine’s strikes against the aircraft Moscow has used to bomb Ukraine for more than three years.
“It didn’t break us at all. The morale is as high as it was. We strongly believe in our armed forces,” said Olha, a 39-year-old from the capital who did not wish to give her last name.
She said the apparent “retaliation” from Russia was not so different to countless other nights of the war. “Maybe (this was the retaliation), but maybe the retaliation is yet to come. Either way, it doesn’t change our attitude towards the enemy or towards our country.”
Meanwhile, Ukraine’s general staff on Friday said it launched overnight strikes on two Russian airfields, where it said Moscow had concentrated many of the aircraft that had not been damaged in Kyiv’s “Spiderweb” operation last weekend.
Ukraine stressed that the operation, which blindsided the Kremlin, had targeted the planes that Russia uses to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian cities and kill civilians. After Russia’s large-scale attack Friday, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Moscow had “responded” to its destroyed aircraft by once again “attacking civilians in Ukraine.”
As daylight broke, images from Kyiv showed flames rising over apartment buildings and firefighting crews at work, with residents picking through the debris of damaged apartments. Several cars parked in the streets below were covered with shards of glass and slabs of masonry torn from the walls of residential buildings.
Ukraine’s air force said Russia’s barrage comprised 407 drones, six ballistic missiles, 38 cruise missiles and an anti-radar missile. Of those 452 projectiles, the air force said it had downed 406, including 32 of the cruise missiles and four of the ballistic missiles. The other two ballistic missiles did not reach their targets, it added.
The strikes also hit Chernihiv, near the border with Belarus, which was rocked by 14 explosions from drones and ballistic missiles, including cruise missiles and Iskander-M missiles, local officials said. Five others were wounded in strikes in the northwestern city of Lutsk, near the border with Poland. Footage geolocated by CNN showed at least four missiles slamming into the city, kicking up fiery explosions on impact.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said it had also intercepted and destroyed 174 Ukrainian drones from Thursday evening to early Friday morning and had destroyed three Ukrainian Neptune-MD guided missiles over the Black Sea.
Putin’s call with Trump
All week, Ukrainians have been bracing for Russia’s retaliation to last weekend’s drone attack, which struck 34% of Moscow’s nuclear-capable bombers stationed at airfields as far away as Siberia.
On Tuesday, Ukraine also launched an attack on the Kerch Bridge, the only direct connection point between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula, with 1,100 kilograms of explosives that had been planted underwater.
After Trump’s call with Putin on Wednesday, the US president said his Russian counterpart had told him that Moscow would have to respond to Ukraine’s assaults. Trump’s account of the call gave no indication that he had urged Putin to temper his response, to the dismay of many in Ukraine.
“When Putin mentioned he is going to avenge or deliver a new strike against Ukraine, we know what it means. It’s about civilians,” Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko told CNN earlier this week. “And President Trump didn’t say, ‘Vladimir, stop.’”
Despite Trump’s support for recent peace talks in Istanbul between Ukraine and Russia, on Thursday he signaled that he may be adopting a more hands-off approach, likening the war to a brawl between children.","['Victoria Butenko', 'Kosta Gak', 'Christian Edwards', 'Michael Rios', 'Jessie Yeung']",en

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. War in Ukraine
Powerful explosions reverberated across the Ukrainian capital overnight as Russia launched waves of drones and ballistic missiles at multiple targets. Search and rescue operations are underway, but at least four people have been killed in Kyiv, with dozens more wounded across Ukraine. The latest barrage comes after Ukraine launched audacious raids on airfields deep inside Russia last weekend. Ukraine also surprised Moscow by attacking the Kerch Bridge — the only direct connection point between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula — with 1,100 kilograms of explosives that had been planted underwater. During a meeting at the White House on Thursday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said President Donald Trump is the one person who could help end the war. “We both agree on this war and how terrible this war is going on, and we are both looking for ways to stop it very soon. And I told the president … he is the key person in the world who can really do that now by putting pressure on Russia,” Merz said.
2. Musk-Trump feud
Two billionaires engaged in a war of words on their own social media sites Thursday, an online version of a reality TV show that kept many utterly transfixed to their screens. But because the individuals in question were tech mogul Elon Musk and the president of the United States, the increasingly heated exchange about Trump’s massive tax and domestic policy bill affected stock prices, worried politicians, prompted calls for impeachment, and renewed interest in the controversial Epstein files. The pair had been close allies ever since Musk gave Trump’s campaign a boost by donating over $290 million to Trump and other Republicans during the 2024 election cycle. After Trump’s return to office, the world’s richest man was a trusted adviser and frequent visitor to the White House. Musk also helmed the Department of Government Efficiency, which took a chainsaw to the federal workforce. But following Musk’s recent departure from the administration, tensions have been growing between the two, and their vitriol was on full display for all to read.
3. International Criminal Court
Secretary of State Marco Rubio unveiled new sanctions on Thursday that targeted four judges on the International Criminal Court for attempting to investigate the US and Israel for alleged war crimes. President Trump authorized the sanctions and possible entrance bans in an executive order he signed in February. That order had already been used to sanction ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan. In response, the ICC said the sanctions were “a clear attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution which operates under the mandate from 125 States Parties from all corners of the globe.” Last November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and for top Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was later killed.
4. Harvard
A federal judge has halted President Trump’s latest attempt to prevent international students from attending Harvard University. Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to suspend international visas for new students at the school and directed the secretary of state to consider revoking visas for current Harvard students who meet the proclamation’s “criteria.” The temporary restraining order, issued late Thursday by US District Judge Allison Burroughs, came just hours after the university requested that she block the proclamation. Burroughs’ order said that if she didn’t intervene now, the school would “sustain immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties.” A hearing has been set for mid-June.
5. Measles
Summer travel season is here and that means millions of people will be in and out of busy airports, train stations and tourist destinations. With more than 1,100 measles cases already reported in the US this year, experts are urging vacationers to take extra precautions to avoid contracting the highly contagious virus. Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine, said people should double-check their immunity status at least six weeks before traveling internationally and read the country-specific travel health notices on the CDC’s website. He also recommended that all travelers stay up-to-date with vaccinations, engage in frequent hand-washing, avoid coming in contact with sick people whenever possible and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/politics/ukraine-war-trump-kids-fighting,Trump compares Ukraine-Russia war to children’s brawl: ‘Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight’,2025-06-05 20:31:24,"For months, President Donald Trump has voiced varying degrees of optimism that he – and only he – will be able to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.
But halting progress, ever-more deadly drone attacks and unmoving negotiating positions seem to have taken their toll. On Thursday, Trump used a striking analogy to concede the warfare was nowhere near over, and that he did not, at that moment, feel it was best to intervene.
“Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy,” Trump said in the Oval Office, with his German counterpart Friedrich Merz looking on silently. “They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”
In this comparison — which Trump said he delivered directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their 75-minute phone call Wednesday — Trump is acting not as the man in the middle but as a referee letting an altercation play out.
“You see it in hockey. You see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds,” he said. “Let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”
It was a frank admission for Trump, the verbal equivalent of throwing up his hands at a problem he cannot solve.
Trump’s evolution — from vowing to end the war in a day to comparing the warring sides to children allowed to spar on a hockey rink — has been, for him, a frustrating one.
He has wavered on applying new sanctions on Moscow, wary of pushing Putin further away from the negotiating table. He also hasn’t approved new military aid for Ukraine, hopeful a swift end to the war means it won’t be required.
A timeline he offered last week for determining Putin’s seriousness in wanting an end to the war — “two weeks” — hasn’t been repeated since, and there seems to be little expectation he’ll take action when the self-imposed deadline arrives on Monday.
His laissez-faire position will be tested over the coming weeks, as Trump embarks on a series of global summits where he’ll come under pressure from US allies to adopt a firmer position.
He’s likely to encounter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in person at the Group of 7 summit in Canada, scheduled for mid-June. For the past three years, the conference has acted as something of a steering committee for western support to Ukraine, with Zelensky attending as a guest to underscore his requests for aid.
This year’s conference promises to be very different. Trump’s aides say there is little expectation he’ll agree to new sanctions on Russia while in Alberta.
A NATO summit a few weeks later will similarly put American support for Ukraine under a spotlight. NATO’s leaders have designed the summit to be brief and heavily focused on increasing member state defense spending, hoping to avoid any open hostility from a US president who has questioned the alliance’s importance.
Still, for all the preparations hosts of both summits have made to appease Trump, his current position on Ukraine could pose existential questions for leaders eager to encourage Trump’s attempts at negotiating a ceasefire.
The stance Trump espoused Thursday may not be his final one. A few moments after his “fight for a while” comparison, he insisted he was “for stopping killing.”
Yet his comments nonetheless reflected a new degree of resignation for his prospects of ending the war, and detachment from the conflict he once vowed to resolve.
“They fight, fight, fight,” he said. “Sometimes you let them fight for a little while.”
The dispassionate tone was similar to how he described his call with Putin on Wednesday, when he related — without comment — the Russian leader’s determination that he would have to retaliate to Ukraine’s audacious drone attack over the weekend.
Trump did not say whether he cautioned Putin or encouraged him to calibrate his response. Nor did he offer any particular view of Ukraine’s actions.
His visitor in the Oval Office on Thursday sought to encourage a more confident outlook. Merz cited the anniversary this week of the D-Day invasion of Normandy — a turning point in World War II — as an example of “when the Americans once ended a war in Europe.”
Trump was not, at first, moved by the comparison.
“That was not a pleasant day for you,” he joked, referring to the defeat of the German Nazis.
Merz kept going, however, stressing the American intervention amounted to “the liberation of my country from Nazi dictatorship” that has parallels to today’s war.
“We know what we owe you,” he said. “But this is the reason why I’m saying that America is, again, in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war.”
Trump did not seem particularly moved. He stopped short of promising new sanctions on Russia — something European leaders have been pressing him on for weeks — saying only he would know when the time is right, but that it hadn’t arrived yet.
“It’s in my brain, the deadline,” he said.
He even suggested he’d be willing to apply new punitive measures on Ukraine if the war doesn’t end.
“We’ll be very, very, very tough, and it could be on both countries to be honest,” Trump said. “You know, it takes two to tango.”",['Kevin Liptak'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/world/ukraine-firefighter-family-russia-attack-intl,"A Ukrainian firefighter rushed to the scene of a Russian drone attack. He found his wife, daughter and grandson dead",2025-06-05 00:00:00,"When the chief of the local fire department was called to a scene of a Russian strike in the central Ukrainian city of Pryluky overnight, he and his brigade found five people were killed and nine injured after a drone hit a residential building.
Among the dead: the firefighter’s wife, his daughter and his baby grandson.
“Three generations… there are no words that can ease this pain,” the Ukrainian National Police said in a statement on Thursday announcing the death of Daryna Shygyda, the firefighter’s daughter, who was a serving police officer.
“She was strong, bright and sincere. She was loyal to her oath, fair and had a deep sense of duty – this is how her colleagues and everyone who knew her will remember her,” the police said in a statement, adding that Shygyda joined the force in 2020, when she was 22 years old.
“Becoming a police officer was her dream and vocation. Her firefighter dad taught her to help people since she was a child. And her husband, who is also a patrol officer, always supported and helped in the service,” the police statement said.
Valentyn and Lyudmila Lotysh, Shygyd’s grandparents, live in another part of the same house, said Shygyd was visiting her mother, their daughter, when the strike happened.
“Misha, the little boy was screaming. And then everything went quiet,” Valentyn Lotysh told Ukrainian public media Suspilne.
“My granddaughter came to visit them with her little one. He (was) such an interesting child. There were five people in the house: the three of them and the two of us,” Lyudmila Lotysh added.
Her son was just one year old. His name was not released, and a photo of the baby shared on social media shows him facing away from the camera, held tightly by his mother and wrapped in a jacket with a wooly winter hat.
According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the boy was the 632nd child killed by Russia since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Zelensky said on Thursday that Russia launched 103 drones and one ballistic missile against the country overnight, targeting multiple regions. At least eight people were killed in the attacks.
Speaking about the Shahed drone attack on Pryluky that killed the firefighter’s family, Zelensky called on Ukraine’s western allies to put extra pressure on Moscow.
“This is yet another massive strike by terrorists – Russian terrorists who kill our people every night,” Zelensky said on Telegram.
“This is yet another reason to impose maximum sanctions and exert pressure together. Strength matters, and only strength can end this war,” he said, adding that Kyiv “expect action from the US, Europe and everyone in the world who can truly help change these terrible circumstances.”
As the Kremlin continues to speak about peace – most recently on Wednesday, when the Russian President Vladimir Putin told Pope Leo XIV that he had “interest in achieving peace” – it continues to terrorize Ukrainian civilians with daily aerial attacks.
A tally compiled by CNN shows that as of Thursday morning, at least 30 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 150 injured in Russian strikes this week alone, including eight in just the past 24 hours.
The attack also comes soon after another phone call between Putin and US President Donald Trump, in which the Russian leader said he would respond to Kyiv’s audacious drone attack on Russia’s air force.
Russia stepped up its airborne attacks against Ukraine in the past few months after it successfully managed to scale up domestic production of its own version of the Iranian-made Shahed drones, the type used most frequently in these attacks.
Analysts say the brutal campaign is part of a deliberate strategy by Russia that is designed to create an impression that it has the upper hand in the conflict and undermine Ukraine’s morale.
The town of Pryluky, where the firefighter’s family and two other people were killed overnight, declared two days of mourning on Thursday and Friday, ordering flags to be flown half-mast and black banners displayed on public buildings.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Kostya Gak']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/politics/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine-response,Trump says Putin told him in phone call he will respond to Ukraine’s weekend drone attacks,2025-06-04 16:57:33,"Russian President Vladimir Putin told US President Donald Trump in a phone call Wednesday that Moscow was obligated to respond to Ukraine’s weekend drone attack, Trump said, setting up a potential escalation in the conflict just as the US president hopes to broker an end to the war.
The leaders’ conversation was their second time speaking in a matter of weeks. Trump, who announced the call afterward in a post on Truth Social, made no mention of applying pressure on the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire, or to calibrate his reprisal for Ukraine’s audacious drone attack on Russian airfields over the weekend.
Instead, Trump acknowledged the 75-minute conversation would not yield an immediate end to the war in Ukraine.
“We discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.”
“President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,” he went on.
In comments on the Trump-Putin call, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said the topic of Ukraine’s raid on the airfields “was also touched upon.” But Ushakov did not say if Putin said he would respond to those attacks.
Trump’s matter-of-fact description of the call offered little evidence of advancement in his attempts to end the war. Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that he feared Trump was tacitly approving Russian retaliation.
“President Trump didn’t say something like, ‘Vladimir, stop.’ And it’s very worrisome because it might look like he is giving a green light to this new crime which Putin is trying to commit,” Merezhko said.
Trump said last week he would be able to determine within two weeks whether Putin was serious about negotiating a ceasefire, but has said little about how he would make that assessment. Meanwhile, there’s been increasing pressure on Trump to levy additional sanctions against Russia, which he has so far resisted.
Russian and Ukrainian officials met earlier this week in Istanbul for direct talks on ending the war, but both sides emerged without budging from their positions. Trump has taken credit for bringing the two sides together for face-to-face discussions.
Ushakov said Putin briefed Trump on the latest round of talks on Wednesday.
“As was emphasized, Ukraine tried to disrupt these negotiations by carrying out, on the direct orders of the Kyiv regime, targeted attacks on purely civilian targets, on the peaceful population,” Ushakov said, without specifying what attacks.
“The leaders agreed to continue further contacts on the Ukrainian issue, including at the highest level and at other levels and through other channels,” Ushakov said.
Neither Trump nor the White House have publicly reacted to the weekend drone attacks beyond saying Ukrainian officials hadn’t informed them of the planned assault ahead of time. Previously, Trump had lashed out at Putin after Russian aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities.
New footage released Wednesday showed in stunning detail the surgical precision with which the Ukrainians struck their targets, damaging or destroying military aircraft that Moscow has been using to terrorize Ukrainian civilians with near-daily aerial attacks.
The video, released by the SBU, Ukraine’s security agency, shows drones approaching dozens of planes of different types across several airfields as aircraft burn and explode around them.
Ukrainian military officials said 41 Russian aircraft were hit, including strategic bombers and surveillance planes, with some destroyed and others damaged.
The Trump-Putin call came the same day US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was meeting in Washington with Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, to discuss the US posture amid the ongoing war.
Rubio was expected to tell Yermak that the Ukrainian position — which the US sees as showing flexibility and a desire to get a ceasefire — was useful, a senior administration official said. But the secretary of state also planned to tell the Ukrainian official that dragging the US back into a Biden-era policy of unlimited military support for Ukraine won’t happen, the official said.
Yermak posted on social media after meeting with Rubio that they discussed the “urgent need to strengthen support for Ukraine’s air defense.” He later sidestepped a question from CNN about whether Trump’s comments undercut efforts at peace, instead expressing appreciation for Trump’s stated commitment to ending the war.
Ukraine’s drone strikes deep inside Russia created a dramatic backdrop for the Washington meetings. The Trump administration has not moved to warn Ukraine against such attacks, US officials said, despite a belief that the strike increases the risk level.
“People have to understand in the national security space: when you attack an opponent’s part of their national survival system, which is their triad, the nuclear triad, that means your risk level goes up because you don’t know what the other side is going to do. You’re not sure,” Keith Kellogg, special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said during a Fox interview on Tuesday.
In his readout of the Wednesday call, Trump also said he discussed Iran with Putin as he works to complete a nuclear agreement with Tehran.
“We also discussed Iran, and the fact that time is running out on Iran’s decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly!” he wrote. “I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and, on this, I believe that we were in agreement.”
He said Putin would likely join discussions with Iran.
“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion. It is my opinion that Iran has been slowwalking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!” Trump wrote.
Ushakov said the two leaders discussed the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program, with Trump saying assistance from Russia “may be needed.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/inside-ukraine-drone-attack-russian-air-bases-latam-intl,New footage reveals the impact of Ukraine’s audacious drone attack on Russian air bases,2025-06-02 19:10:04,"Ukraine’s drone attack against Russian airfields was audacious and daring. But most of all, it was meticulously planned and flawlessly executed.
New footage released on Wednesday shows in stunning detail the surgical precession with which the Ukrainians struck where they knew it would make a difference, damaging or destroying military aircraft that Moscow has been using to terrorize Ukrainian civilians with near daily aerial attacks.
The video, released by the SBU, Ukraine’s security agency, shows drones approaching dozens of planes of different types across several airfields as aircraft burn and explode around them.
Ukrainian military officials said 41 Russian aircraft were hit, including strategic bombers and surveillance planes, with some destroyed and others damaged.
Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said the attack was “a stunning success for Ukraine’s special services.”
“If even half the total claim of 41 aircraft damaged/destroyed is confirmed, it will have a significant impact on the capacity of the Russian Long Range Aviation force to keep up its regular large-scale cruise missile salvos against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, whilst also maintaining their nuclear deterrence and signaling patrols against NATO and Japan,” he wrote in a note.
This is what we know about how the attack unfolded.
Striking from within Russia
The attacks targeted four airfields deep inside Russia, with the farthest one, the Belaya base in Irkutsk region, some 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) from Ukraine’s border with Russia.
The other targets included the Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Ukraine; the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, some 520 kilometers (320 miles) from Ukraine; and the Ivanovo air base, which is a base for Russian military transport aircraft, some 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the border.
A visual shared by the SBU also showed another base in the eastern Amur region as a target. It is not clear whether an attack on this base failed or was aborted.
It’s these huge distances from the border with Ukraine that likely made Russia complacent about protecting the sites.
Its most prized aircraft at the Belaya base were regularly parked in plain sight in the airfield, clearly visible in publicly available satellite images – including on Google Maps.
Satellite images provided to CNN by Maxar show planes parked on the airfield next to what appears to be a decoy – a picture of a plane painted on the ground in white paint.
Many of the aircraft are seen with tires and other dark objects placed on their wings and roofs, an apparent attempt to make them harder to spot for some missile guidance systems.
Moscow likely believed the distance itself was enough to keep the aircraft safe from Ukrainian attacks.
Russia maintains air superiority over Ukraine and while Kyiv’s allies have supplied Ukraine with some long-range missile systems, including US-made ATACMS and British-French Storm Shadows, neither has the range to strike this deep inside Russia.
Ukraine has been using drones against targets inside Russia, including in Moscow, but the low speed at which they travel makes them relatively easy for Russian air defenses to strike them.
This is where the audacity of the attack really played out: rather than trying to fly the drones all the way from the border, Ukraine managed to smuggle them right next to the sites it wanted to target and launched them from there.
Insufficient Russian defenses
Russia’s radar and air defenses at these bases were not prepared for such a low-altitude and sudden attack.
The only effective way to stop an attack like this is with heavy machine guns. Russia has been using these against Ukrainian sea drones in the Black Sea.
But these were either not available or not deployed quickly enough at the air bases targeted by Ukraine on Sunday – most likely because Russia simply didn’t foresee this type of attack.
CNN was able to verify and geolocated photos and videos from the scenes, confirming their locations near the bases.
Russia’s Defense Ministry confirmed in a statement that the attacks – which it called “terror attacks” were launched from the vicinity of the airfields.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the operation.
According to the SBU, the drones were smuggled into Russia by its operatives. At some point, likely while already in Russia, the drones were then hidden inside mobile wooden sheds.
Photos obtained by CNN show the drones tucked just under the sheds’ metal roofs, slotted in insulation cavities.
These wooden cabins were then placed on trucks and driven to locations near the bases.
Ukraine did not disclose how exactly it managed to get the vehicles into the vicinity of high-profile military targets without detection, but reports in Russian media suggested it was relatively simple.
Baza and Astra, two Russian Telegram channels, both reported that the trucks were bought by a Ukrainian man who lived in Russia who then simply paid a quartet of drivers to get them where he needed them.
Neither Russian nor Ukrainian authorities commented on these reports, but the Russian state news agency RIA reported that authorities in the Irkutsk region were searching for a man who was suspected of being involved in the attack. His name matched the name reported by Baza and Astra.
The Ukrainian Security Service said the operatives involved in the operation were safely back in Ukraine by the time the attacks started. Zelensky said they worked across multiple Russian regions spanning three time zones.
A senior source with Ukraine’s drone development program told CNN the pilots who flew the drones were probably nowhere near the locations from which they were launched.
“They would have likely setup an internet hub allowing the pilots to (control them) remotely, each rapidly deploying each FPV (first person view drones), hitting each target one by one.”
The source said the communication hub could be “a simple Russian cell phone” which is harder to track than other systems, such as Starlink that is used widely in Ukraine.
A source briefed on the matter confirmed the attack was carried out via Russian telecommunications networks.
Once the trucks were in place and the drones ready to go, the cabin roofs opened and the drones flew towards their targets.
The footage released on Wednesday shows the drones getting incredibly close to the aircraft, flying around and looking for the best place to strike. They approach the aircraft seemingly undetected, hitting one plane after another.
‘Brilliant operation’
A video of the attack in Russia’s southeastern Irkutsk region that was shared on social media and verified and geolocated by CNN shows two drones flying out of a truck.
They are seen heading towards the Belaya air base in the distance, where thick dark smoke is already billowing from a previous strike.
Another video from the same location shows the truck used to transport the drones on fire after what appears to be an explosion designed to self-destruct the truck.
Zelensky said on Sunday that the attack was in the making for one year, six months and nine days, and praised the security services for a “brilliant” operation.
Russian officials have downplayed the attack, saying strikes were repelled in the Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions but that “several pieces of aircraft” caught fire after attacks in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions. It added that the fires had since been extinguished.
It said there were no casualties. But while Russian authorities tried to downplay the attack, several high-profile Russian military bloggers have been vocal in their criticism.
Rybar, a high-profile Russian military blog, said the attack caused a “tragic loss for the entire Russian air fleet” and was a result of “criminal negligence.”
The SBU said the strikes caused an estimated $7 billion in damages and hit 34% of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers at its main air bases – a claim CNN cannot independently verify.
Ukraine said it destroyed several TU-95 and Tu-22M3 strategic bombers and one of Russia’s few remaining A-50 surveillance planes.
Air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat told Ukrainska Pravda that while some of the aircraft were completely destroyed and some were damaged beyond repair, some may be repairable – although he said they would likely be out of action for a “long time.”
A source briefed on the matter said 27 Tu-95, four Tu-160, two Tu-22M3 and “probably” an A-50 were hit.
The footage released on Wednesday shows Ukrainian drones approaching two of the rare A-50 aircraft, although it is unclear whether both were hit. The Russian air force uses the aircraft for airspace surveillance and early detection of airborne threats. It also plays a role in command and control of aerial attacks against Ukraine.
The Tu-22M3 is Russia’s long-range missile strike platform that can perform stand-off attacks, launching missiles from Russian airspace well behind the front lines to stay out of range of Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire.
Russia had 55 Tu-22M3 jets and 57 Tu-95s in its fleet at the beginning of the year, according to the “Military Balance 2025” report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.
The Tu-95 joined the Soviet Union air force in the 1950s, and Russia has modified them to launch cruise missiles like the Tu-22.
Bronk, the RUSI expert, said that replacing some of these aircraft would be very difficult for Russia because they have not been produced for decades.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Vasco Cotovio', 'Frankie Vetch', 'Eve Brennan', 'Benjamin Brown', 'Gianluca Mezzofiore', 'Mitchell McCluskey', 'Helen Regan']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/europe/nuclear-threat-ukraine-russia-latam-intl,"As Ukraine batters Russia with daring assaults, firebrand pro-Kremlin pundits rattle nuclear sabers",2025-06-04 04:01:03,"How will Moscow respond to the stunning Ukrainian drone strikes on its fleet of strategic aircraft?
So far, the Kremlin has stayed tight-lipped, saying only that it is waiting for the results of a formal investigation into the attacks, which struck air bases thousands of miles from the Ukraine border.
But fury is being openly vented across the Russia media, with pro-Kremlin pundits and bloggers seething with calls for retribution, even nuclear retaliation.
“This is not just a pretext but a reason to launch nuclear strikes on Ukraine,” the prominent “Two Majors” bloggers said on their popular Telegram channel, which has over a million subscribers.
“After the mushroom cloud you can think about who lied, made mistakes and so on,” they added, referring to the inevitable Kremlin search for scapegoats for the fiasco.
At least one prominent Russian political analyst, Sergei Markov, urged caution, warning in a social media post that using nuclear weapons would “lead to real political isolation”.
But popular blogger Alexander Kots demanded Russia should “strike with all our might, regardless of the consequences.”
Of course, Russian hardliners routinely clamor for the nuclear obliteration of Ukraine, while issuing thinly veiled, but ultimately empty threats of Armageddon aimed at the Western allies. The fact they are doing so again, after such a painful series of attacks, is hardly surprising.
But it would be wrong to get too complacent and dismiss all Russian nuclear saber-rattling as mere propaganda.
In fact, there are some worrying reasons to take the slim possibility of a devastating Russian response a little more seriously this time around.
Firstly, several Russian pundits have commented on how Ukraine’s destruction of a significant number of Russian strategic nuclear bombers may be interpreted as breaching Moscow’s legal nuclear threshold.
The Kremlin’s recently updated nuclear doctrine – which sets out conditions for a launch – states that any attack on “critically important” military infrastructure which “disrupts response actions by nuclear forces” could trigger a nuclear retaliation.
The Ukrainian operation was “grounds for a nuclear attack,” declared Vladmir Solovyov, a firebrand host on Russian state TV, calling for strikes on the Ukrainian presidential office in Kyiv, and beyond.
Whatever the legality, the barrier for a Russian nuclear response remains mercifully high and such a strike is likely to be dismissed in Kremlin circles as an impractical overkill.
For a start, it would poison relations with key Russian trading partners like China and India, as well as provoke potential military action against Russian forces.
Inevitable mass casualties would be certain to invite universal scorn, further isolating Russia on the international stage.
But here’s the problem: the Kremlin may now feel overwhelming pressure to restore deterrence.
It’s not just the recent Ukrainian drone strikes, deep inside Russia, that have humiliated Moscow. Shortly afterwards, Ukraine staged yet another bold attack on the strategic Kerch bridge linking Russia with Crimea – the third time the vital road and rail link has been hit.
The capture by Ukrainian forces of the Kursk region in western Russia last year dealt another powerful blow, leaving the Kremlin struggling to liberate its own land. Meanwhile, weekly, if not daily, drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure and airports continue to cause widespread disruption far from the front lines.
At the same time, Ukraine’s allies have been gradually lifting restrictions on the use of Western-supplied arms against Russia, further challenging what were once believed to be Moscow’s red lines.
Few doubt the Kremlin is itching to respond decisively, but how?
One former Russian minister told CNN the most likely response by Moscow would be more “barbaric” conventional missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities of the kind that the people of Ukraine have already suffered for years.
“There’s no other way to go, because Russia does not have the capacity to launch a massive military offensive. They don’t have enough personnel for it,” said Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister now living outside of Russia.
“People talk about potential use of nuclear weapons and so on. I don’t think this is on the table. But, again, Putin has shown many times that he is resorting to barbarity and revenge.”
In other words, highly unlikely, but the nuclear option can’t be entirely discounted. This Ukraine conflict has already taken multiple unexpected turns, not least the full-scale Russian invasion itself in 2022.
And while Ukraine and its supporters revel in the stunning successes of recent military operations, poking a humiliated and wounded Russian bear may yield dangerous and frightening consequences.",['Matthew Chance'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/europe/russia-war-casualties-1-million-ukraine-intl,"Russia nears 1 million war casualties in Ukraine, study finds",2025-06-03 00:00:00,"Nearly 1 million Russian soldiers have been killed or injured in the country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a new study, a grisly measure of the human cost of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked three-year assault on his neighbor.
Russia will likely hit the 1 million casualty mark this summer, said the study, published Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think tank in Washington, DC. It said the “stunning” milestone was a “sign of Putin’s blatant disregard for his soldiers.”
Of the estimated 950,000 Russian casualties so far, as many as 250,000 are dead, according to the study. “No Soviet or Russian war since World War II has even come close to Ukraine in terms of fatality rate,” it said. Ukraine has sustained nearly 400,000 casualties, it added, with between 60,000 and 100,000 deaths.
Although Kyiv does not disclose its own combat losses in any detail and Moscow is believed to drastically underestimate its own casualties, the CSIS figures are in line with British and United States intelligence assessments.
In March, the British defense ministry estimated that Russia had sustained around 900,000 casualties since 2022. For months, it has judged that Russia is losing about 1,000 soldiers each day, whether killed or wounded. Based on that trend, Russia would be expected to surpass the 1 million threshold in the coming weeks.
Rebutting claims from some Western lawmakers that Russia holds “all the cards” in the war in Ukraine, the CSIS study used Russian casualty figures – as well as estimates of its heavy equipment losses and sluggish territorial gains – as evidence that Moscow’s military “has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield” and failed to achieve its main war goals.
After Ukraine repelled Russia’s initial “blitzkrieg” assault in 2022, the war has since become attritional. While Kyiv dug in with trenches and mines, Moscow funneled more and more troops into what have become known as “meat grinder” assaults, throwing soldiers into campaigns for only marginal territorial gains, the study said.
In the northeastern Kharkiv region, Russian forces have advanced an average of only 50 meters per day, according to the study. That is slower than the British and French advance in the Battle of the Somme in the trench warfare of World War I.
The slow rate of advance has meant Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory since January 2024, which the authors called a “paltry” amount. Russia now occupies around 20% of Ukraine’s territory, including the Crimean peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014.
But Russia’s dwindling territorial gains have not led to a change in strategy. To sustain Russia’s staggering rate of casualties, the Kremlin has enlisted convicts from its prisons and welcomed more than 10,000 troops from its ally North Korea, but it has left the children of Moscow and St. Petersburg elites largely untouched.
Instead, Moscow has recruited in the far north and far east of the country, where men have been lured by pay packages that are life-changing among poorer communities in those regions. “Putin likely considers these types of soldiers more expendable and less likely to undermine his domestic support base,” the study noted.
Whereas Ukraine, a democracy with a population less than a quarter the size of Russia’s, has faced some pushback in its attempts to mobilize more troops, Russia, where criticism of the war has been outlawed, has faced no significant dissent. But, with the war now well into its fourth year, the authors warned that the “blood cost” of its protracted campaign was a potential vulnerability for Putin.
Although Russia has had the “initiative” in the conflict since early 2024, the authors said the attritional nature of the war has left “few opportunities for decisive breakthroughs.”
Instead, Russia’s main hope to win “is for the United States to cut off aid to Ukraine” – as President Donald Trump briefly did earlier this year – and “walk away from the conflict” – as officials in his administration have threatened to do.",['Christian Edwards'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/03/europe/russia-forces-advance-northern-ukraine-sumy-intl,"Despite Ukraine’s daring attacks, Russian forces advance on major city of Sumy",2025-06-03 00:00:00,"Russian forces are advancing in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, bringing the regional capital within range of their drones and artillery, according to Ukrainian officials and analysts.
The advance comes even as Russia had appeared to be put on the back foot by two audacious Ukrainian attacks in recent days – a drone attack that took out multiple Russian aircraft on Sunday and a strike on a bridge connecting Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula using underwater explosives on Monday.
Russian forces are now constantly shelling the area as they try to advance on Sumy city, and civilians are being evacuated, according to Ivan Shevtsov, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military in the area.
“At the moment, the territory that the enemy has already occupied is about 15 kilometers along the front line and about 6-7 kilometers deep,” Shevtsov said. He added that the Russians were trying to advance towards the town of Yunakivka, within a few kilometers of their current positions.
The Sumy military administration said that Russian troops had carried out almost 150 shelling attacks on 47 settlements in the region in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning.
For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed Tuesday that its forces had captured the village of Andriivka as they broadened the front, according to the official TASS news agency.
Shevtsov said that with further advances the Russians would be able to launch more coordinated attacks on Sumy city. Its current population is unknown, but before the war began it was home to about a quarter of a million people.
The unofficial Ukrainian group DeepState, which monitors the frontlines, reported that Russian forces had occupied another settlement in northern Sumy, putting them about 20 kilometers from Sumy city.
It said: “The situation in the north of the Sumy region continues to deteriorate due to constant pressure from the enemy and large numbers of infantry.”
“The threat of the enemy’s advance is that it will reach a distance of 20-25 kilometers, which will allow FPV drones to fly to the city of Sumy,” DeepState said.
It added that Ukrainian forces were unable to combat the Russians’ use of fiber-optic drones, which are capable of evading jamming.
“A separate issue is the lack of personnel to hold back the enemy, which is severely lacking,” DeepState said.
The Russians have reinforced their units in the area over recent weeks, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), since President Vladimir Putin visited the adjacent Russian region of Kursk in mid-May and ordered the creation of a buffer zone within Sumy.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned last month that Russia had amassed more than 50,000 troops near the Sumy region. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, are stretched across multiple points on the front lines, from the northern border to the Black Sea.
ISW said Monday that Russian forces had recently intensified ground assaults and brought in several experienced brigades, including airborne troops.
Shevstov, the Ukrainian military spokesman, said Russian forces aimed “not just to enter and create a so-called buffer zone 20-30 kilometers deep, but to completely capture the Sumy region.”
Sumy city was targeted Tuesday by a rocket attack, which killed four people and injured 28, including three children, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service. Zelensky described it as “a savage strike…directly targeting the city and its ordinary streets with rocket artillery.”
On Monday, Zelensky described northern Sumy as one of the “hottest” parts of the front line.
Capturing Sumy’s regional capital is probably beyond the Russians – the terrain is thickly forested. But through their attacks, the Russian military can prevent the Ukrainians from redeploying units to Donetsk and elsewhere on the front line.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/europe/russia-war-casualties-1-million-ukraine-intl,"Russia nears 1 million war casualties in Ukraine, study finds",2025-06-03 00:00:00,"Nearly 1 million Russian soldiers have been killed or injured in the country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a new study, a grisly measure of the human cost of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked three-year assault on his neighbor.
Russia will likely hit the 1 million casualty mark this summer, said the study, published Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think tank in Washington, DC. It said the “stunning” milestone was a “sign of Putin’s blatant disregard for his soldiers.”
Of the estimated 950,000 Russian casualties so far, as many as 250,000 are dead, according to the study. “No Soviet or Russian war since World War II has even come close to Ukraine in terms of fatality rate,” it said. Ukraine has sustained nearly 400,000 casualties, it added, with between 60,000 and 100,000 deaths.
Although Kyiv does not disclose its own combat losses in any detail and Moscow is believed to drastically underestimate its own casualties, the CSIS figures are in line with British and United States intelligence assessments.
In March, the British defense ministry estimated that Russia had sustained around 900,000 casualties since 2022. For months, it has judged that Russia is losing about 1,000 soldiers each day, whether killed or wounded. Based on that trend, Russia would be expected to surpass the 1 million threshold in the coming weeks.
Rebutting claims from some Western lawmakers that Russia holds “all the cards” in the war in Ukraine, the CSIS study used Russian casualty figures – as well as estimates of its heavy equipment losses and sluggish territorial gains – as evidence that Moscow’s military “has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield” and failed to achieve its main war goals.
After Ukraine repelled Russia’s initial “blitzkrieg” assault in 2022, the war has since become attritional. While Kyiv dug in with trenches and mines, Moscow funneled more and more troops into what have become known as “meat grinder” assaults, throwing soldiers into campaigns for only marginal territorial gains, the study said.
In the northeastern Kharkiv region, Russian forces have advanced an average of only 50 meters per day, according to the study. That is slower than the British and French advance in the Battle of the Somme in the trench warfare of World War I.
The slow rate of advance has meant Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory since January 2024, which the authors called a “paltry” amount. Russia now occupies around 20% of Ukraine’s territory, including the Crimean peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014.
But Russia’s dwindling territorial gains have not led to a change in strategy. To sustain Russia’s staggering rate of casualties, the Kremlin has enlisted convicts from its prisons and welcomed more than 10,000 troops from its ally North Korea, but it has left the children of Moscow and St. Petersburg elites largely untouched.
Instead, Moscow has recruited in the far north and far east of the country, where men have been lured by pay packages that are life-changing among poorer communities in those regions. “Putin likely considers these types of soldiers more expendable and less likely to undermine his domestic support base,” the study noted.
Whereas Ukraine, a democracy with a population less than a quarter the size of Russia’s, has faced some pushback in its attempts to mobilize more troops, Russia, where criticism of the war has been outlawed, has faced no significant dissent. But, with the war now well into its fourth year, the authors warned that the “blood cost” of its protracted campaign was a potential vulnerability for Putin.
Although Russia has had the “initiative” in the conflict since early 2024, the authors said the attritional nature of the war has left “few opportunities for decisive breakthroughs.”
Instead, Russia’s main hope to win “is for the United States to cut off aid to Ukraine” – as President Donald Trump briefly did earlier this year – and “walk away from the conflict” – as officials in his administration have threatened to do.",['Christian Edwards'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/03/europe/russia-forces-advance-northern-ukraine-sumy-intl,"Despite Ukraine’s daring attacks, Russian forces advance on major city of Sumy",2025-06-03 00:00:00,"Russian forces are advancing in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, bringing the regional capital within range of their drones and artillery, according to Ukrainian officials and analysts.
The advance comes even as Russia had appeared to be put on the back foot by two audacious Ukrainian attacks in recent days – a drone attack that took out multiple Russian aircraft on Sunday and a strike on a bridge connecting Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula using underwater explosives on Monday.
Russian forces are now constantly shelling the area as they try to advance on Sumy city, and civilians are being evacuated, according to Ivan Shevtsov, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military in the area.
“At the moment, the territory that the enemy has already occupied is about 15 kilometers along the front line and about 6-7 kilometers deep,” Shevtsov said. He added that the Russians were trying to advance towards the town of Yunakivka, within a few kilometers of their current positions.
The Sumy military administration said that Russian troops had carried out almost 150 shelling attacks on 47 settlements in the region in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning.
For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed Tuesday that its forces had captured the village of Andriivka as they broadened the front, according to the official TASS news agency.
Shevtsov said that with further advances the Russians would be able to launch more coordinated attacks on Sumy city. Its current population is unknown, but before the war began it was home to about a quarter of a million people.
The unofficial Ukrainian group DeepState, which monitors the frontlines, reported that Russian forces had occupied another settlement in northern Sumy, putting them about 20 kilometers from Sumy city.
It said: “The situation in the north of the Sumy region continues to deteriorate due to constant pressure from the enemy and large numbers of infantry.”
“The threat of the enemy’s advance is that it will reach a distance of 20-25 kilometers, which will allow FPV drones to fly to the city of Sumy,” DeepState said.
It added that Ukrainian forces were unable to combat the Russians’ use of fiber-optic drones, which are capable of evading jamming.
“A separate issue is the lack of personnel to hold back the enemy, which is severely lacking,” DeepState said.
The Russians have reinforced their units in the area over recent weeks, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), since President Vladimir Putin visited the adjacent Russian region of Kursk in mid-May and ordered the creation of a buffer zone within Sumy.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned last month that Russia had amassed more than 50,000 troops near the Sumy region. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, are stretched across multiple points on the front lines, from the northern border to the Black Sea.
ISW said Monday that Russian forces had recently intensified ground assaults and brought in several experienced brigades, including airborne troops.
Shevstov, the Ukrainian military spokesman, said Russian forces aimed “not just to enter and create a so-called buffer zone 20-30 kilometers deep, but to completely capture the Sumy region.”
Sumy city was targeted Tuesday by a rocket attack, which killed four people and injured 28, including three children, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service. Zelensky described it as “a savage strike…directly targeting the city and its ordinary streets with rocket artillery.”
On Monday, Zelensky described northern Sumy as one of the “hottest” parts of the front line.
Capturing Sumy’s regional capital is probably beyond the Russians – the terrain is thickly forested. But through their attacks, the Russian military can prevent the Ukrainians from redeploying units to Donetsk and elsewhere on the front line.

Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, said on Telegram that its agents had mined the piers of the road and rail Crimean Bridge, also called the Kerch Bridge, and detonated the first explosive at 4.44 a.m. Tuesday. The whole operation took several months, it added.
The agency said it had used 1,100 kilograms of explosives which “severely damaged” the underwater pillars supporting the bridge.
Traffic on the bridge was suspended early Tuesday morning, then again mid-afternoon, before resuming shortly before 6 p.m. local time. Although the scale of the damage was not immediately clear, Tuesday’s attack is the latest example of the SBU’s attempts to blindside Moscow and demonstrate that there are costs to continuing its war.
On Sunday, the SBU launched an audacious drone attack on Moscow’s fleet of nuclear-capable bombers, stationed at various Russian airfields thousands of miles away from Ukraine.
Vasul Malyuk, the head of the SBU, said that attack caused an estimated $7 billion in damage and had struck 34% of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers, which have been used to pummel Ukrainian cities throughout the war.
The SBU said Malyuk had also overseen Tuesday’s attack.
“God loves the Trinity, and the SBU always sees things through to the end and never does the same thing twice. We previously struck the Crimean Bridge twice, in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition, this time underwater,” Malyuk said.
He stressed that the bridge is a “completely legitimate target,” since Russia uses it “as a logistical artery to supply its troops” fighting in mainland Ukraine.
As well as serving as a vital supply line for Moscow’s troops, the Crimean Bridge also has huge symbolic value for President Vladimir Putin, embodying his objective to bind the Ukrainian peninsula to Russia.
Built after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin opened the bridge in 2018. The project cost around $3.7 billion.
Tuesday’s attack marks the third time that Ukraine has targeted the bridge since Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022. In October of that year, a fuel truck exploded on the bridge, engulfing a part of it in flames. In July 2023, the SBU said it had blown up a part of the bridge using an experimental sea drone. Both times, Russia moved quickly to repair the damaged sections.
As well as suspending traffic on the bridge, Russian authorities temporarily halted maritime traffic in the waters off Sevastopol, the largest city in Crimea, according to state media RIA Novosti.","['Christian Edwards', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Anna Chernova']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/putin-ukraine-peace-talks-trump-latam-intl,Putin didn’t budge in Ukraine peace talks. Now Donald Trump may be forced to act,2025-06-02 22:16:55,"So, Russia and Ukraine are still as far apart as ever, with the two warring countries unable to make a significant breakthrough in direct talks in Istanbul.
While there was agreement to exchange more prisoners, Moscow and Kyiv remain deeply divided over how to bring the costly and bitter Ukraine war to an end.
Russia has shown itself to be particularly uncompromising, handing Ukrainian negotiators a memorandum re-stating its maximalist, hardline terms which would essentially amount to a Ukrainian surrender.
Expectations were always low for a Kremlin compromise. But Moscow appears to have eliminated any hint of a readiness to soften its demands.
The Russian memorandum again calls on Ukraine to withdraw from four partially occupied regions that Russia has annexed but not captured: a territorial concession that Kyiv has repeatedly rejected.
It says Ukraine must accept strict limits on its armed forces, never join a military alliance, host foreign troops or aquire nuclear weapons. It would be Ukrainian demilitarization in its most hardline form, unpalatable to Ukraine and much of Europe, which sees the country as a barrier against further Russian expansion.
Other Russian demands include the restoration of full diplomatic and economic ties, specifically that no reparations will be demanded by either side and that all Western sanctions on Russia be lifted.
It is a Kremlin wish-list that, while familiar, speaks volumes about how Moscow continues to imagine the future of Ukraine as a subjugated state in the thrall of Russia, with no significant military of its own nor real independence.
Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s hawkish former president and prime minister who is now a top security official, said outright on Tuesday that Moscow’s goal in the peace talks is not to “compromise,” but to achieve a “speedy victory.” He said this was the “meaning” of Russia’s memorandum.
This uncompromising position comes despite two important factors which may have given the Kremlin pause.
Firstly, Ukraine has developed the technical capability to strike deep inside Russia, despite its staggering disparity of territory and resources. The stunning drone strikes recently targeting Russian strategic bombers at bases thousands of miles from Ukraine is a powerful illustration of that. Ukraine, it seems, has some cards after all, and is using them effectively.
Secondly – and arguably more dangerously for Moscow – the Kremlin’s latest hardline demands come despite US President Donald Trump’s increasing frustrations with his own Ukraine peace efforts.
Trump has already expressed annoyance with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, who he said had gone “absolutely MAD” after massive Russian strikes on Ukraine last week.
But now, Trump himself is under pressure as a cornerstone of his second term foreign policy – bringing a rapid end the Ukraine war – looks decidedly shaky.
There are powerful levers to pull if Trump chooses, like increasing US military aid or imposing tough new sanctions, such as those overwhelmingly supported in the US Senate. One of the key backers of a cross-party senate bill that aims to impose “crippling” new measures on Moscow, Senator Richard Blumenthal, accused Russia of “mocking peace efforts” at the Istanbul talks and in a carefully worded post on X accused the Kremlin of “playing Trump and America for fools.”
It is unclear at the moment how the mercurial US president will react, or what – if anything – he will do.
But the outcome of the Ukraine war, specifically the brokering of peace deal to end it, has become inextricably linked with the current administration in the White House.
The fact that Putin has once again dug in his heels and presented an uncompromising response to calls for peace, may now force Trump to act.",['Matthew Chance'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-turkey-drone-attack-intl,Second round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks ends swiftly with no major breakthrough,2025-06-02 13:05:08,"Russian and Ukrainian delegates met in Istanbul on Monday for their second set of direct peace talks, a day after Kyiv launched a shock drone attack on Russia’s nuclear-capable bombers, in an operation that President Volodymyr Zelensky said was a year and a half in the making.
The talks began late and lasted barely over an hour. Although both sides agreed to work on a new prisoner exchange, statements from the two sets of delegations suggested that little had been achieved to bridge the gulf between their positions, particularly on the matter of a ceasefire.
After the initial round of discussions in the Turkish city last month – the first between the warring countries since soon after Russia’s full-scale invasion in early 2022 – both sides agreed to share their conditions for a full ceasefire and a potentially lasting peace.
Russian state media agencies reported that Russia laid out two ceasefire “options” in its peace memorandum.
In the first option, Moscow will ask for the complete withdrawal of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) from Ukraine’s mainland Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions, RIA Novosti reported. Russia annexed those regions during its invasion in 2022, but has been unable to fully capture them in the years since.
In the second option, called a “package deal,” the UAF would have to demobilize, and all foreign military aid to Kyiv, including intelligence, would be halted, a summary of the memorandum published by RIA Novosti said.
Ukraine would also be prohibited from deploying and mobilizing its armed forces, and martial law in Ukraine would need to be lifted, with elections to be held no later than 100 days after it is lifted, the memorandum outlined.
It is not clear whether Ukraine can choose just one of the options, or whether it must agree to both.
The maximalist demands expand on the terms set by Russia during the 2022 trilateral talks held in Turkey.
In the past, Ukraine has refused Russian proposals for territorial concessions in exchange for peace.
Zelensky criticized Russia for not sharing its memorandum ahead of time. “Despite this,” he said before the talks began, “we will attempt to achieve at least some progress on the path toward peace.”
It is not yet clear if Ukraine’s daring Sunday air raid will streamline that path or make it more thorny. Kyiv has long sought to impress upon the Kremlin that there are costs to prolonging its campaign, but some analysts have warned that the operation – which struck Russian airfields thousands of miles from Ukraine’s borders – will only replenish Moscow’s resolve.
The mission, codenamed “Spiderweb,” was one of the most significant blows that Ukraine has landed against Russia in more than three years of full-scale war. Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, said it had smuggled the drones into Russia, hiding them in wooden mobile homes latched onto trucks. The roofs were then remotely opened, and the drones deployed to launch their strikes on four Russian airfields across the vast country.
Vasul Malyuk, the head of the SBU, said the attack caused an estimated $7 billion in damage and had struck 34% of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers – a total of 41 aircraft. These targets were “completely legitimate,” Malyuk said, stressing that Russia had used the planes throughout the conflict to pummel Ukraine’s “peaceful cities.”
The operation has provided a much-needed boost to morale in Ukraine, which has come under fierce Russian bombardment since peace talks began in mid-May, and is bracing for an expected summer offensive. Moscow launched a record 472 drones at Ukraine overnight into Sunday, only hours before the Ukrainian attack, according to Ukrainian officials.
At a summit in Lithuania on Monday, an upbeat Zelensky said the operation proved that Ukraine has “stronger tactical solutions” than Russia.
“This is a special moment – on the one hand, Russia has launched its summer offensive, but on the other hand, they are being forced to engage in diplomacy,” Zelensky said.
The talks in Istanbul were seen by many as a test of how genuine that engagement is. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed holding “direct talks” with Ukraine in Turkey, but didn’t show up, despite Zelensky agreeing to meet. In the end, Moscow sent a low-level delegation to negotiate instead.
The second round of talks also failed to yield significant results. Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s defense minister who headed its delegation, criticized Moscow for not sharing its memorandum ahead of Monday’s meeting.
Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Moscow’s delegation, said Moscow had given Ukraine a “very detailed and well-developed” document during the talks, which Kyiv would now study.
Whereas Umerov reiterated that Ukraine’s demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire has “remained unchanged for three months,” Medinsky said Russia had proposed a much narrower ceasefire, lasting just two or three days in “certain parts” of the frontline.
Zelensky insisted that Russia’s offer is “not a ceasefire.”
“What they are talking about is not a ceasefire, because meanwhile the war continues on the other areas of the front line, on all other areas and civilian infrastructure and civilians are being attacked,” Zelensky said in a press briefing on Monday.
Ukraine has insisted that a 30-day ceasefire is a test of whether Russia is serious about ending its war and is likely to view Moscow’s offer for a shorter truce as a ploy to rotate its combat units.
Seeking to speed up the peace process that Russia is keen to string out, Umerov said Ukraine had proposed a meeting between Zelensky and Putin by the end of this month.
“We firmly believe that all key issues can only be solved at the level of leaders,” Umerov said, suggesting that the leaders of other countries – such as US President Donald Trump – could also take part in the meeting.
Following the Istanbul meeting on Monday, Zelensky said that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested a meeting between themselves, Putin, and Trump. Zelensky said he is open to such a meeting.
In the latest sign of his frustration that the war he pledged to end in a day is showing little sign of stopping, Trump said last week that Putin had gone “absolutely crazy,” after Moscow launched the largest aerial attack of the war.
Trump has repeatedly told Russia and Ukraine there will be consequences if they don’t engage in his peace process, although he has so far resisted growing calls from lawmakers in his Republican Party to use sanctions to pressure Putin into winding down his war.
Speaking in Lithuania, Zelensky said that if Monday’s meeting “brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently, urgently needed.”","['Christian Edwards', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Gul Tuysuz', 'Anna Chernova']",en

The operation, dubbed “Spiderweb,” saw drones hit targets across a large swathe of Russia, including in Belaya – which is closer to Japan than Ukraine – and at Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, according to the source.
More than 40 Russian aircraft were “burning en masse” at four air bases, the source said.
The SBU, Ukraine’s domestic intelligence agency, said the strikes caused an estimated $7 billion in damages and hit 34% of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers at its main air bases.
The drone attacks came on the eve of expected peace talks in Istanbul between Russia and Ukraine, which were already strained by uncertainty and pressure from US President Donald Trump.
The Trump administration was not given a heads-up about the operation, an administration official told CNN.
The strikes appear intended to send a message to Russia that Ukraine could still apply pressure more than three years since Russia’s unprovoked invasion. Kyiv has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of not wanting to end the war as Moscow ramps up its attacks and offensive operations, including launching its largest drone assault on Ukraine since the war began overnight Saturday.
The operation, more than a year and a half in the making, involved drones being smuggled into Russian territory and hidden in wooden mobile houses atop trucks, according to the security source. The roofs were then remotely opened, and the drones deployed to launch their strikes.
Social media video geolocated by CNN to seven kilometers southeast of the Belaya Air Base in Russia’s eastern Irkutsk region, appears to show a drone flying out of a wooden shed loaded onto a truck as smoke rises in the background. Images also show drones stacked inside what appear to be wooden crates with retractable roofs ahead of the operation.
“The planning, organization, and all the details were perfectly prepared. It can be confidently said that this was an absolutely unique operation,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X.
Zelensky said 117 drones were used to carry out the attacks, which were played up as a military and propaganda win for Ukraine that caught Russia off-guard.
“The ‘office’ of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,” Zelensky said on X.
More than 40 aircraft were known to have been hit, according to the Security source, including TU-95 and Tu-22M3 strategic bombers and one of Russia’s few remaining A-50 surveillance planes.
“We are doing everything to drive the enemy from our native land! We will strike them at sea, in the air, and on land. And if needed — we’ll reach them even from underground,” the SBU said in a statement.
A senior US defense official told CNN that Ukraine’s attack showed a level of sophistication that they had not seen before.
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth received regular updates as he traveled to Joint Base Andrews on Sunday but has not yet spoken to his Ukrainian counterparts, the official said.
The airfields targeted included Belaya in Irkutsk, some 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) from Ukraine’s border with Russia, and the Dyagilevo base in Ryazan in western Russia, about 520 kilometers (320 miles) from Ukraine, which is a training center for Russia’s strategic bomber force.
The Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Ukraine, was also struck, according to the source, as well as the Ivanovo air base, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Ukraine. Ivanovo is a base for Russian military transport aircraft.
The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed Ukraine had targeted Russian airfields across five regions on Sunday, calling the drone strikes “terrorist attacks.”
The ministry said strikes were repelled in the Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions but that “several pieces of aircraft” caught fire after attacks in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions. It added that the fires had since been extinguished.
There were no casualties as a result of the attacks, the ministry continued, adding that “some participants in the terrorist attacks have been detained.”
The governor of Irkutsk region, Igor Kobzev, said that drones had been launched from a truck near the Belaya base.
Kobzev said on Telegram that the exact number of drones deployed had not been determined. Emergency and security services were at the site, he added.
SBU drones were targeting aircraft that bomb Ukrainian cities every night, the security source said.
One video supplied by the source purportedly shows the Belaya airfield in flames and the voice of the head of the SBU, Lt. Gen. Vasyl Malyuk, commenting on the situation. “How beautiful Belaya airfield looks now. Enemy’s strategic aircraft,” he says.
CNN was able to confirm the location of that video, as well as two others posted on social media showing smoke rising from the Belaya air base. It was not immediately able to independently verify other videos provided by the SBU.
The security source said that the operation was “extremely complicated from a logistical point of view,” with the drones carried inside wooden mobile homes that had been carried into Russia on trucks.
“The drones were hidden under the roofs of the houses, which were already placed on trucks. At the right moment, the roofs were remotely opened, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers.”
One video purportedly of one attack appears to show drones rising from a truck, as vehicles pass on a nearby highway. Another image shows the roof of the truck on the ground.
The source added that people involved were already back in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s operation followed a Russian attack overnight Saturday that involved 472 drones – Moscow’s largest drone attack since the war began. It came the same day as a Russian missile strike on a training site used by Ukrainian forces, killing at least 12 people and wounding more than 60 others. It also came soon after two bridges collapsed in Russia’s western regions bordering Ukraine in unclear circumstances.
This chain of events comes as Russia and Ukraine are set to return to peace negotiations on Monday. The talks, which will take place in Istanbul, have been strained by uncertainty. US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration around Russian President Vladimir Putin’s resistance to advancing the peace talks.
Putin proposed holding “direct talks” in Turkey earlier this month – but never showed up, despite Zelensky agreeing to meet. In the end, the two nations sent low-level delegations to negotiate instead.
A framework from the Ukrainian delegation lists key principles for the talks that include a full and unconditional ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, and the release of hostages and return of abducted children.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/02/europe/analysis-drone-strikes-ukraine-russia-peace-trump-latam-intl,Drone strikes ahead of Russia-Ukraine peace talks leave Trump’s credibility hanging by a thread,2025-05-30 00:00:00,"It was already hard to imagine a breakthrough emerging from the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine set to be renewed in Istanbul on Monday.
But in the aftermath of what appear to have been multiple large-scale Ukrainian drone strikes against strategic bases across Russia, it’s even less likely either side will be prepared to shift their red lines.
Even before the latest strikes, which targeted Russian strategic aircraft thousands of miles from the Ukrainian border, the Kremlin had declined to formally set out, in the form of an agreed-to memorandum, what exactly it wants in return for ending what it refers to as its “Special Military Operation”.
But Russian officials have made no secret about their hardline terms, including sovereignty over all annexed territories, the demilitarization of Ukraine, immediate sanctions relief and what the Kremlin calls “de-Nazification”, involving things like guaranteeing the rights of Russian-speakers.
Concerns about further NATO expansion toward Russian borders – especially Ukraine, but other countries too – have also been a consistent Kremlin grievance, as has the fate of hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets abroad.
There’s been speculation in the Russian and Western media about areas for possible negotiation, and the outcome of the Istanbul talks are being closely watched for any hints of flexibility.
But in the aftermath of what appears to have been a spectacular Ukrainian success, talk of Kremlin compromises may, for the moment, be off the table.
Ukraine goes into this second round of direct talks bolstered by its apparent destruction of Russian strategic bombers and other crucial air assets.
On Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky set out some of Ukraine’s positions, including an unconditional ceasefire and the return of Ukrainian children taken to Russia.
But Russian demands for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from territory it claims but has not even conquered remain unpalatable, even more so now Ukraine has shown it can still strike deep behind the front lines.
Even before the latest Ukrainian drone strikes, amid preparations for the peace talks in Istanbul, Russia was stepping up attacks on Ukraine in what seems to be the early stages of a new summer offensive.
Overnight Saturday, Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine since the beginning of the war – involving 472 drones. On Sunday, a Russian missile strike killed at least 12 people and wounded more than 60 at a training site for the Ukrainian military.
As all this unfolds, an increasingly frustrated US President Donald Trump, who used to brag he could end the Ukraine war in short order, is now watching from the sidelines as a cornerstone of his stated foreign policy looks decidedly shaky.
Neither his pressure on the Ukrainian leader, who Trump lambasted in the Oval Office, nor his recent scolding of the Kremlin ruler appear to have pushed the two sides any closer to a peace deal.
Trump still has powerful levers to pull if he chooses, like imposing tough new sanctions, such as those overwhelmingly supported in the US Senate, or adjusting US military aid in a way that would dramatically increase the costs of fighting on. The measures may not be decisive, but they would send a message of US commitment.
What Trump says he is tempted to do, though, is simply walk away from the whole mess. This is Biden’s war, he insists, or Putin’s and Zelensky’s.
But walking away – and it is unclear what that means in terms of US policy – may no longer be an option. At least not walking away unscathed.
His own insistence on ending the Ukraine conflict, along with his personal interventions with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders, means that Trump and the United States are now inextricably linked with the outcome.
That’s why events on the battlefield and at the negotiating table in Istanbul are being watched so closely.
Despite his regular attempts to disown it, the Ukraine war has very much become Trump’s war on which US credibility now hangs by a thread.",['Matthew Chance'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/01/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-trump-latam-intl,Russia and Ukraine may meet again for peace talks. But neither side gives reason for optimism,2025-05-24 00:00:00,"Since last sitting down with Ukraine to talk peace, Russia has launched four of its five largest drone attacks against the country, killed more than 340 of its civilians and continued to peddle its false narrative about the unprovoked war it has been waging for more than a decade.
Now, Moscow wants to talk. Again.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the next round of talks between Russia and Ukraine would take place in Turkey on Monday. On Sunday, Kyiv confirmed that it would be sending a delegation to the meeting, as Russian state media reported that a Russian delegation was flying to Istanbul for the talks.
Ukraine also announced on the same day the most ambitious simultaneous strikes on Russian air bases carried out by its forces since the war began, adding an extra layer of uncertainty to the already fragile talks in Turkey.
Kyiv says that Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange their requirements for a ceasefire during their previous meeting in Istanbul last month. But while Kyiv said it presented its plan last week, Russia has not.
The Kremlin has so far ignored the call by Ukraine to present the plan. In a post on Telegram on Wednesday, Lavrov said the Russian delegation would present its memorandum to Ukraine at the meeting on June 2.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Kremlin’s failure to hand over its plan was “another Russian deception” and accused Moscow of not wanting to end the war.
“For a meeting to be meaningful, its agenda must be clear, and the negotiations must be properly prepared,” Zelensky wrote on X on Friday, after hosting Turkey’s foreign minister for talks in Kyiv.
Zelensky said he’d also discussed the potential second round of peace talks with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday, writing on Telegram: “We discussed a possible next meeting in Istanbul and under what conditions Ukraine is ready to take part in it. We share the view that this meeting cannot and should not be empty.”
In a post on X on Sunday, the Ukrainian leader said that he had requested “preparation of the (Istanbul) meeting at the highest level” in order to “establish a reliable and lasting peace and ensure security.” Zelensky added that Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov would lead the delegation again.
But even though Russian and Ukrainian officials have agreed to meet on Monday, their summit is unlikely to yield any immediate results.
Statements made by Russian officials in recent days make it clear that Moscow is sticking to its maximalist demands.
Speaking after a phone call with US President Donald Trump on May 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated his demand that the “root causes” of the conflict must be eliminated.
The “root causes” include long-held Russian grievances that include the existence of Ukraine as a sovereign state, and NATO’s eastward expansion since the end of the Cold War.
Kyiv has dismissed these demands, as accepting them would effectively amount to capitulation.
Show for Trump
The talks on Monday may be designed mostly to appease Trump, who has repeatedly told both Ukraine and Russia that there will be consequences if they don’t engage in his peace process.
Trump has been pressuring Kyiv to talk to Moscow, threatening to walk away from the talks and cut US aid if he concludes that Ukraine isn’t cooperating.
And while he has threatened “massive sanctions” against Russia if it doesn’t agree with his 30-day ceasefire proposal, he has also voiced concern that potential new sanctions on Russia could jeopardize a deal.
On Friday, a bipartisan pair of US senators met with Zelensky in Kyiv. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut are co-sponsoring a bill to impose more sanctions on Russia – including a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other products. It must pass both chambers of Congress and be approved by Trump to become law.
Asked by reporters on Friday if he would support the bill, Trump responded: “I don’t know, I’ll have to see it. I’ll take a look at it.”
Putin has not explicitly rejected the ceasefire proposals, choosing instead to delay and distract.
Russia’s insistence on having the talks and presenting its ceasefire proposal only once the two sides meet is just the latest example of this tactic.
Putin initially proposed the first round of the talks in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Ukraine’s European allies.
The Russian president ignored the ultimatum, proposing instead “direct talks” between Moscow and Kyiv. This prompted Trump, who initially backed the ultimatum, to change his tune and call on Zelensky to “take the meeting.”
Moscow’s conduct since the talks last month suggests no desire to end the war with a ceasefire.
Russian forces have intensified airborne attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, are stepping up ground attacks in many areas along the front line, and Moscow is building up its forces elsewhere.
At the same time, Putin ordered one of the largest expansions of the Russian military in recent years.
Meanwhile, over the weekend, Ukraine carried out its most ambitious simultaneous strikes on Russian airbases since the war began, using drones to destroy multiple Russian combat planes on Sunday, according to a source in the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU).
The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed Ukraine had targeted Russian airfields across five regions, calling the drone strikes “terrorist attacks.”
The day before, two bridges in western regions of Russia collapsed, killing at least seven people and injuring dozens. It was not clear on Sunday morning whether the two incidents — which both involved trains — in neighboring Bryansk and Kursk were related, or what exactly caused the separate collapses. Investigators from Russia’s Investigative Committee were working at the scenes to establish the circumstances of what happened.
Expectations were running high ahead of the talks last month, the first direct meeting between Ukraine and Russia since the early days of the full-scale war. This was mostly because of speculation that Putin himself might show up, after being challenged to travel to Turkey by Zelensky.
When the Russian leader sent a low-level delegation in his place, it became clear no breakthrough was in sight. Although the two sides agreed to hold the largest ever prisoner exchange during the meeting, there was no sign of a ceasefire agreement being any closer.
As for the latest meeting, while it’s obvious that neither Moscow nor Kyiv are particularly keen on talking to each other, and have little expectation of actual progress, they are likely to play along just to keep Trump interested.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

It was not clear on Sunday morning whether the two incidents — which both involved trains — in neighboring Bryansk and Kursk were related, or what exactly caused the separate collapses.
At least seven people were killed in Bryansk when a road bridge gave way onto a passenger train late Saturday, with railway authorities citing “illegal interference.”
The bridge came down in the region’s Vygonichi district, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Ukrainian border, crushing the moving train and injuring at least 66 people, including three children, Russian authorities reported.
Bryansk’s regional governor Alexander Bogomaz blamed the collapse in his region on an explosion, saying the bridge had been “blown up,” according to state media.
Bogomaz said on Telegram that 44 people had been hospitalized, with three in serious condition, including a child. The train was carrying 388 passengers.
Among those killed in the incident was the train’s engineer, Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti reported.
The train was traveling from the town of Klimov to the capital, Moscow, when it was hit by the debris from the bridge and derailed, according to RIA.
Images of the wreckage from the Moscow interregional transport prosecutor’s office show fallen earth, debris and concrete on top of what appears to be the passenger train, and derailed carriages as emergency services attend the scene.
Moscow Railway said the collapse was caused by “illegal interference in transport operations,” without providing further details.
Passengers were evacuated from the wreckage and were taken to a temporary accommodation center at a nearby station, according to TASS.
Railway workers later discovered damage to another section of railway track also in Bryansk region, Bogomaz said, adding that there were no casualties.
In another incident overnight into Sunday, a bridge collapsed in Russia’s Kursk region – which also borders Ukraine – as a freight train was passing over it, injuring one of the drivers, according to the acting governor of the region.
“Part of the train collapsed onto a highway that was under the bridge,” acting governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Telegram. The incident caused the train to catch fire and emergency service personnel worked to extinguish the blaze, he added.
Putin received updates about the two incidents throughout the night from the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Russia’s emergencies ministry, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Sunday, according to state media.
State media also reported that the Russian leader had discussed the incidents on the phone with Bogomaz and the head of Russian Railways, Oleg Belozerov.
In a third incident on Saturday night, a Russian military freight train was blown up near the occupied city of Melitopol in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, according to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine.
“As a result of the explosion, the train with fuel tanks and freight cars derailed on the railway track,” the intelligence service said.
The freight train was moving towards Russian-occupied Crimea via a “key logistical artery” often used by Russian forces, the authority added.
Since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv has responded to Russian aggression by launching attacks using drones, artillery and troops into the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions. Pro-Ukrainian agents and sympathizers inside Russia have also carried out acts of sabotage against Russian targets.
In 2023, a fire that ripped through a train as it traveled along a strategic rail tunnel in eastern Russia was attributed to the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), according to a Ukrainian defense source.
Early Sunday, Russia’s Investigative Committee described both incidents as being caused by explosions and labeled them “terrorist” acts, state media reported. Subsequent statements from the committee removed those references, saying only that investigators were working at the scene of the incidents to establish “all the circumstances of what happened.”
Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, part of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, dismissed Russia’s earlier claim, saying: “Once again, there is a temptation to portray us as a ‘terrorist country’ in order to avoid dialogue.”
“It seems that the Kremlin is preparing the ground for the collapse of the negotiations with a smear attack on Ukraine in the international media,” he said.
On Sunday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Kyiv would send a delegation to the second round of planned peace talks with Russia in Istanbul on Monday.
The Ukrainian leader went on to list his country’s requirements in a post on X, which he said includes a full and unconditional ceasefire, the release of prisoners and the return of abducted children.
Zelensky also said that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov would once more lead the Ukraine delegation.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut met with Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials in the capital. Their visit came just days after Russia launched its biggest aerial assault against Ukraine since the start of the war, and as the US ramps up pressure on Moscow to end the three-year conflict.
Among the topics discussed were the ongoing peace talks and proposed legislation to strengthen US sanctions against Russia, according to a statement from the Ukrainian presidential office.
Graham and Blumenthal are co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill to impose more sanctions on Russia – a notion that has gained support among a number of Republican lawmakers in recent weeks as Moscow steps up its deadly aerial assaults.
Graham said lawmakers would move forward next week with a vote on the bill, the Reuters news agency reported. The bill is supported by 82 senators from both sides of the aisle and would impose a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other products. It must pass both chambers of Congress and be approved by President Donald Trump to become law.
Trump has so far held off on imposing more sanctions as he tries to negotiate a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv. However, he has threatened in the past to impose the measures if Russia doesn’t agree to a truce.
Asked by reporters on Friday if he would support the bill, Trump responded: “I don’t know, I’ll have to see it. I’ll take a look at it.”
Graham said Friday he had talked with Trump before his trip and the US president expects “concrete action” from Moscow, according to Reuters.
The visit comes as Ukrainian officials raised questions about planned peace talks in Istanbul on Monday – as they say Russia has yet to send its negotiating proposals, a key demand of Kyiv’s.
“For a meeting to be meaningful, its agenda must be clear, and the negotiations must be properly prepared,” Zelensky wrote on X on Friday after hosting Turkey’s foreign minister for talks in Kyiv.
Zelensky also said he spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, writing on Telegram: “We share the view that this meeting cannot and should not be empty.”
“Neither we in Ukraine nor Turkey as the host side have any information about Russia’s so-called memorandum,” he said in his evening address, accusing Russia of “hiding” its memorandum from both countries.
Ukraine has already provided its own version of a peace memorandum, officials say.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday that Moscow would present its memorandum during the next round of talks.
Zelensky said he and his Turkish counterpart also spoke about the possibility of organizing a four-way meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the United States to further facilitate peace negotiations.
In recent weeks, the US president has become visibly frustrated with Russia over its deadly attacks on Ukraine and the lack of progress on peace talks.
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed holding “direct talks” in Turkey earlier this month – but never showed up, despite Zelensky agreeing to meet. In the end, the two nations sent low-level delegations to negotiate instead.
A large-scale prisoner exchange, the biggest since the start of the war, was the only significant outcome, with both sides agreeing to release 1,000 prisoners on each side – but it was overshadowed by ongoing Russian attacks at the same time.
Trump voiced frustration with Putin at the time, saying: “We’re in the middle of talking, and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities.”",['Jessie Yeung'],en

The report was released Thursday by the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT), an initiative made up of 11 United Nations members, formed after Russia forced the disbandment of a previous UN panel that monitored the implementation of sanctions against North Korea.
While some of the team’s findings have been well documented – such as North Korea sending troops to fight for Russia – the report lays out the stunning scope and scale of weaponry sent from Pyongyang since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
That includes as many as 9 million rounds of artillery and ammunition in 2024; more than 11,000 troops last year, and another 3,000 troops in the early months of this year; rocket launchers, vehicles, self-propelled guns and other types of heavy artillery; and at least 100 ballistic missiles “which were subsequently launched into Ukraine to destroy civilian infrastructure and terrorize populated areas such as Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia,” the report found, citing participating states.
“These forms of unlawful cooperation between (North Korea) and Russia contributed to Moscow’s ability to increase its missile attacks against Ukrainian cities including targeted strikes against critical civilian infrastructure,” the report said.
In return, Russia provided North Korea with various valuable pieces of weaponry and technology, including air defense equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, electronic warfare systems and refined oil, the report said.
Moscow has also provided data feedback on Pyongyang’s ballistic missiles, helping improve its missile guidance performance, it said.
These actions “allow North Korea to fund its military programs and further develop its ballistic missiles programs, which are themselves prohibited under multiple (UN Security Council resolutions), and gain first-hand experience in modern warfare,” the report found.
It said its findings were based on MSMT participating states and cited supporting evidence from the Open Source Centre (OSC), a UK-based non-profit that uses publicly accessible information for research, and Conflict Armament Research (CAR), a UK-based research organization.
Both Russia and North Korea are violating the UN arms embargo and are transferring arms and military equipment through actors and networks that evade sanctions, the report alleged. The two countries will likely continue their military cooperation “at least for the foreseeable future,” it added.
In a joint statement, the member nations behind the MSMT – Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States – urged North Korea to “engage in meaningful diplomacy.”
Western governments have become increasingly concerned about the long-term implications of what appears to be a deepening strategic partnership between the two nations.
In recent months, the US has warned that Russia may be close to sharing advanced space and satellite technology with North Korea in exchange for continued support for the war in Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged in April for the first time that North Korean soldiers took part in the fighting to recover Russian territory after Ukraine’s incursion into the Kursk region last year. North Korea also confirmed its troop presence there for the first time in April.
Though North Korean troops had been deployed to Kursk since at least November, they withdrew from the front lines in January after reports of mass casualties, Ukrainian officials said.
Both countries have denied that Pyongyang is supplying arms to Moscow, despite overwhelming evidence. However, as part of a landmark defense pact struck last year, they have both pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.

Zaur Aleksandrovich Gurtsiev, who was 34 according to Russian state media, died alongside another man in the blast on a street in Stavropol, which investigators said “committed using a homemade explosive device.”
“As part of the investigation, the scene of the incident is being inspected, examinations are being ordered, and the necessary investigative actions are being carried out to establish all the circumstances of the incident,” Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a Thursday statement.
Video footage circulated online and on state media appears the show the moment of the blast, which occurs just as Gurtsiev meets the other man in a darkened street, near a row of parked cars.
After the blast, the footage seemingly shows Gurtsiev lying on the ground, while the second man is rocked back by the explosion.
The man who died in the explosion in Stavropol along with Gurtsiev rented an apartment in a building near the scene of the incident, emergency services told state media outlet TASS.
Regional governor Vladimir Vladimirov wrote on Telegram that “all versions are being considered, including the organization of a terrorist attack” involving Ukraine.
Gurtsiev had taken part in the “Time of Heroes” program set up by President Vladimir Putin, used to promote veterans of Russia’s war in Ukraine to official positions in the government.
According to the Time of Heroes website, “Gurtsiev, despite his relatively young age, led the air part of the operation to liberate Mariupol.”
“He introduced his developments in the technology of targeting missiles, which allowed them to increase their accuracy and effectiveness many times over, including hitting the Azov supply base.”
Russian forces seized control of the port city of Mariupol in 2022 following a brutal 86-day siege – one of the deadliest and most destructive battles since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.
According to United Nations estimates, 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in Mariupol during Russian attacks, and around 350,000 people out of the pre-war population of about 430,000 were forced to flee.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview earlier this year that 20,000 civilians are believed to have been killed, though the death toll cannot be independently verified. Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of trying to cover up evidence of civilian casualties, a claim the Kremlin denies.
Gurtsiev is the latest in a number of Russian military figures to have been killed inside the country over the past year, a period in which the ramifications of Moscow’s war have increasingly been felt domestically.
Last month Russian authorities charged a “Ukrainian special services agent” with terrorism, after he was detained in connection with a car explosion that killed Russian General Yaroslav Moskalik, the deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.
And in February Armen Sarkisyan, the founder of a pro-Russian militia group in eastern Ukraine – described by authorities in Kyiv as a “criminal mastermind” – died following a bombing in central Moscow. The bombing took place in an upmarket residential complex in the capital city, state media outlet TASS reported at the time.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/29/europe/ukraine-drone-wall-russian-offensive-intl,Ukraine scrambles to set up ‘drone wall’ as it braces for Russian summer offensive,2025-05-25 00:00:00,"Russia dramatically intensified missile and drone attacks across Ukraine this month in an effort to sap Ukrainians’ morale – but it is also stepping up ground attacks in many areas along the long frontline, according to Ukrainian officials and analysts.
Some of those attacks have succeeded, with Ukrainian units in Donetsk and the north falling back from some positions, while some rural areas in the south have also been lost.
But Ukraine’s own enhanced use of drones, deployed in several layers on the battlefield, has helped Kyiv inflict heavy losses on the opposing forces with minimal casualties among its own troops. They may become even more critical in the months to come.
The Ukrainians are trying to expand their own drone industry to create defensive corridors along key sections of the front line, often dubbed the “drone wall.”
Meanwhile, ignoring US President Donald Trump’s efforts to secure a ceasefire, the Kremlin is pursuing a two-pronged strategy aimed at forcing Ukraine to admit defeat – destroying its cities from the sky and whittling away its defensive lines on the ground.
Russia has sharply expanded its own drone and missile production in the past year, allowing for mass attacks using several hundred projectiles at once. The Russian strategy seeks to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses with scores of low-cost drones so that simultaneous missile strikes can succeed.
On the ground, Russian forces are probing Ukrainian defenses along many parts of the frontline simultaneously, from Zaporizhzhia in the south to Sumy in the north, advancing into abandoned villages and across open countryside in small numbers.
The Russians are not rolling through Ukrainian defenses but gnawing away at them, using cars and motorbikes and scattered infantry platoons.
Russian forces have advanced an average of roughly 14 square kilometers (5.4 square miles) per day so far this year, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in Washington. This rate implies they’d need nearly four more years to complete the occupation of the four regions illegally annexed by Moscow: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
Those are the Kremlin’s oft-stated goals, but it is also trying to instil a sense among Kyiv’s allies of Russian superiority over Ukrainian forces.
Much of the fighting is in Donetsk, with the Russians still determined to seize the entire region – unless it is handed over in peace negotiations, which is a non-starter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Tuesday that a village south of the key town of Kostiantynivka had been taken. ISW assesses that Russian forces seized roughly 65 square kms of territory - but remain incapable of intensifying offensive operations in several different directions simultaneously.
“The main Russian effort into the summer will once again be against the key towns of Kostyantynivka and Pokrovsk” in Donetsk, according to Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London.
Hundreds of miles to the north, Russian units have edged a few kilometers into the Sumy region.
Zelensky told journalists Tuesday that the Russians are “now amassing troops in the Sumy direction. More than 50,000. We understand that. But we are making progress there.”
Zelensky said the Russians wanted “to build this buffer zone, as they call it, 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) deep into Ukraine,” but lacked the capability.
The Russians are supporting these operations with missile and air-launched guided-bomb attacks.
The attacks into Sumy follow a Kremlin directive on May 21 that the military create buffer zones inside northern Ukraine – in Sumy and Kharkiv regions. That came when President Vladimir Putin visited Russia’s Kursk region across the border, part of which had been seized by a Ukrainian incursion launched from Sumy last summer.
Capturing Sumy’s regional capital is probably beyond the Russians – the terrain is thickly forested. But through their attacks, the Russian military can prevent the Ukrainians from redeploying units to Donetsk.
Further east there’s also been an uptick in fighting around Vovchansk in Kharkiv region in recent days.
Across the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) frontline, according to analysts, the Ukrainian military has to decide which areas are under greatest threat, where to withdraw, how to redeploy – even as many brigades are seriously under-strength more than three years after the Russian invasion.
The manpower balance is still very much in Russia’s favor, despite its heavy losses. Putin recently claimed that 60,000 volunteers are being recruited every month. Observers believe this is likely exaggerated but signing-up bonuses that dwarf civilian wages in Russia make military service an attractive option.
Ukraine’s military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said earlier this month that Kyiv faced “a combined enemy grouping of up to 640,000 personnel,” higher than at the outset of the invasion. Zelensky said in January that Ukraine had 880,000 soldiers, “but 880,000 are defending the entire territory. Russian forces are concentrated in certain directions.”
Russian recruitment “has exceeded Kremlin targets for every month of 2025,” according to the RUSI analyst Watling. “Having shuffled commanders and built-up reserves of equipment, Russia is now set to increase the tempo and scale of attacks.”
But for every square kilometer of Ukrainian land that Russia captures, Moscow is probably losing about 100 men, according to Western assessments.
Layers of drones
Above and behind the frontlines as well as in the air campaign being waged by Moscow, the development and deployment of drones will continue to be critical.
The recent Russian advances in Donetsk, while incremental, were enabled by the tactic of isolating the battlefield – cutting Ukrainian units from supplies through drone strikes on supply vehicles up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the front lines.
Ukrainian defenses are heavily reliant on layers of drones. The Ukrainians are developing a concept sometimes dubbed the “drone wall,” designed to “provide a continuous defensive corridor of drones along Ukraine’s most vulnerable frontiers to inflict significant casualties on Russian forces,” according to Mick Ryan, author of the blog Futura Doctrina.
Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst at Rochan Consulting, says that “Ukrainian forces are increasingly lethal with drone-artillery coordination. Russian assaults — motorcycle-based and armored — were defeated across several fronts with minimal Ukrainian losses” in April.
But Ryan points out that an effective drone wall will require integration “and probably AI-assisted decision-making and analysis,” as well as integration with electronic warfare.
And it’s a two-way street. Ukrainian drones are “guided by small radar, and Russia is now systematically working to locate and target these radar stations,” Watling writes.
Zelensky said Tuesday that Russia plans to ramp up production of Shahed attack drones to between 300 and 350 per day. Asked whether there may come a time when Russia fires 1,000 drones in one day, he replied: “I cannot say that this will not happen.”
Sending drones in their hundreds saturates air defenses, as they accumulate over a target area. Russia has also developed drones that can evade Ukrainian jamming and can fly higher and faster than earlier models. Ukrainian analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko said last week that one Shahed had been observed at a record altitude of 4,900 meters.
According to Zelensky, Ukraine is now deploying F-16 and Mirage fighter jets to supplement air defenses. “We are also moving towards drone-to-drone interceptors,” he said Tuesday.
Ukraine’s former military chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, says Ukraine must wage a “high-tech war of survival” in which drones play a critical role, to “make the economic burden of the war unbearable for Russia.”
Speaking to a Kyiv forum last week, Zaluzhnyi – now Ukraine’s ambassador to London - said that his country had failed to exploit innovations “where yesterday we were ahead of the enemy. The enemy has already outpaced us.”
Analysts cite Russia’s growing use of short-range fiber-optic drones that can’t be jammed as one example of the technological race. Ukraine is yet to scale up the use of such drones, which rely on millimeters-thick, but miles-long, optical fibers.
Zelensky denied Ukraine was losing the drone war.
“We will have the same number of drones as the Russians, 300-500 per day - we are very close to it,” he said.
The issue was not production, Zelensky said – it was financial. As Ukraine seeks to produce more of its own weapons – often in association with Western manufacturers, Zelensky added: “I would like to see us receive $30 billion to launch Ukrainian production at full capacity.”
But that is a long-term goal.
Watling, from RUSI, envisages a tough few months for Ukraine that “will place a premium on the efficiency of Ukrainian drone and artillery operations, the ability of Ukrainian commanders to preserve their troops, and the continuity of supplies flowing from Ukraine’s international partners.”
The continuation of US supplies is unsure as Trump blows hot and cold about whether Washington should continue helping Ukraine defend itself.
Putin is “desperately seeking to prevent the future supply of Western military aid to Ukraine,” according to ISW, “as well-resourced Ukrainian forces have consistently demonstrated their ability to inflict unsustainable losses on Russian forces.”
Innovation and tactical agility will be as influential as brute force as the war enters its fourth summer.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/politics/two-weeks-trump-ukraine-war,"In Trump’s telling, a resolution in Ukraine is always two weeks away",2025-05-28 22:46:32,"It’s been a long two weeks.
Since at least the end of April, President Donald Trump has been telling reporters he will decide what to do in Ukraine in two weeks, using the timeframe over and over to suggest he is close to a final assessment on how to proceed.
It is not a new tactic. Trump has been setting two-week deadlines since at least the start of his first term in 2017 — for policy plans, long-awaited decisions or unspecified major announcements. Many never arrived.
Now, as Trump faces a decision on whether to apply new sanctions on Moscow or to walk away altogether from efforts to broker peace, he again says it will take a fortnight to determine whether his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war in Ukraine.
“We’re going to find out whether or not he’s tapping us along or not. And if he is, we’ll respond a little bit differently,” Trump said Wednesday when questioned in the Oval Office about Putin’s intentions. “But it’ll take about a week and a half, two weeks.”
Trump did not say what, exactly, he was waiting to learn in the next two weeks that would cause him to finalize his assessment of the Russian leader. Nor did he say exactly what he was prepared to do when the deadline was up.
How to end the seemingly intractable war in Ukraine has become one of the major conundrum’s of Trump’s presidency. To his deep frustration, the conflict has proved more difficult to resolve than he expected.
As far back as April 24, Trump suggested a reporter follow up – in two weeks – with their question about continued military assistance in Ukraine.
“Let’s see what happens,” he said. “You can ask that question in two weeks, and we’ll see.”
Three days later, it was as if no time had passed.
“We’ll let you know in about two weeks,” he told a reporter that day who asked whether he trusted the Russian president.
As it turned out, Wednesday was exactly two weeks from another of Trump’s assertions, on May 14, that he would soon provide an update on whether Putin was “tapping him along.”
“I’ll let you know in a week,” he told reporters on Air Force One. “I’ll let you know in a few days.”
About a week after that, on May 19, he said it would take another two weeks to determine whether Ukraine was doing enough to end the conflict.
“I’d rather tell you in about two weeks from now because I can’t say yes or no,” he said.
Trump and his team have been exasperated over the last week waiting for Moscow to produce a memorandum laying out its position on potential peace talks. The Kremlin said Wednesday the document was finished, and that it would present it to Ukraine during a round of talks in Istanbul next week.
But there was little to indicate any new breakthroughs were imminent in ending the conflict.
The plodding pace of talks has led Trump to worry Putin could be dragging things out. Yet the US president has, so far, stopped short of imposing sanctions or taking other action. He acknowledged this week there was more he could do.
“What Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “He’s playing with fire!”
Even as Trump continues to mull new sanctions on Moscow, potentially targeting the banking or energy sectors, he voiced concern new measures could push Putin away from talks.
“If I think I’m close to getting a deal, I don’t want to screw it up by doing that,” he said Wednesday, suggesting he remains undecided on whether to move ahead with the various options his team has drawn up.
He has also weighed walking away altogether from his attempts to mediate the war if it appears the two sides’ differences cannot be bridged. His top lieutenants have said at various points over the last month that time is growing short for any American role in ending the war.
“I think this is going to be a very critical week. This week is going to be really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told an NBC interviewer on April 27.
If a determination was made the following week, it wasn’t made public.
Instead, Trump has tried to keep his options open while still attempting to distance himself from the war. After speaking with Putin by telephone last week, he said it would be up to Ukraine and Russia to resolve their differences.
He told European leaders the same day he would not join them in applying new sanctions – at least for now. And he said in his view, Putin believed he was winning the war.
Yet by the following Sunday, he’d grown frustrated again with the Russian leader, who had launched the biggest aerial assault of the 3-year war on multiple Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv.
“I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin,” Trump bemoaned, claiming his counterpart had changed over time.
In fact, a changed Putin is precisely what many European leaders have been warning Trump of for months, even before he returned to office. In December, as Trump visited Paris for the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral, French President Emmanuel Macron tried telling him the Russian leader he got to know during his first term in office was not the same man.
He hadn’t appeared to internalize the warnings until this week, when he deemed Putin had gone “absolutely CRAZY.” On Wednesday, he insisted his forceful new tone was itself a strong rebuke of Moscow, even absent new sanctions.
“The words speak pretty loud,” he insisted. “We’re not happy about that situation.”
But when asked whether he still believed Putin wanted the war to end, he said he would need more time.
“I can’t tell you that,” he said, “but I’ll let you know in about two weeks.”",['Kevin Liptak'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/europe/zelensky-germany-taurus-missiles-latam-intl,"Zelensky departs Germany with pledge for help with long-range weapons, but no Taurus missiles",2025-05-28 17:23:49,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will leave Berlin with a new €5 billion ($5.7bn) arms package as he seeks to build his country’s arsenal, and its ability to produce weapons at home.
The standout agreement in the package announced in the German capital on Wednesday centers around Germany financing the joint production of long-range missiles inside Ukraine that would enable Kyiv to strike targets deep into Russia.
Also included in the announcement were more air defense systems, weapons, ammunition, “command and operational” capabilities and medical assistance.
One significant aspect was missing. There had been big expectations prior to the news conference that Merz would announce the transfer or approval of Ukraine’s use of Germany’s highly sophisticated long-range Taurus missiles.
Merz had been very strong on ensuring Ukraine received Taurus during the election campaign against Olaf Scholz, the former chancellor, of the Social Democrats. Scholz and the party were very reticent to send the weapons, worried it may escalate the conflict even further.
It appears that Merz’s own fledging coalition with the Social Democrats – now the junior partners in government – appears to have its own significant disagreement on Taurus.
One member of Merz’s party, the Christian Democrats, tweeted on Tuesday: “I still see no unity within the coalition and no political will to respond appropriately, with force and consistency to Russia’s massive escalation.”
The system would allow Ukraine to strike targets far beyond the capabilities of British Storm Shadow and American-made ATACAM missiles.
But standing shoulder to shoulder with Zelensky in Berlin, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said: “We will be expanding this support so that Ukraine, now and in the future, can continue to defend itself against Russian aggression.”
Merz added that “this is the beginning of a new phase of industrial military cooperation between our countries that has a great deal of potential.”
However, in keeping with a new edict from the chancellor and his new government, tangible details of that deal were not forthcoming. It has made a conscious decision to withhold information around weapons exchanges to ensure “strategic ambiguity.”
The deal nevertheless signifies a major step in deepening the co-operation between Germany and Ukraine, particularly in terms of arms procurement.
It also marked the third meeting in as many weeks between the two leaders – especially significant given that Merz has only been chancellor for three weeks.
A later statement released from the German defense ministry said it plans “to invest more directly in Ukrainian production in the future.”
Zelensky appeared to hint at today’s agreements before leaving Kyiv for Germany’s capital. In his nightly address on Tuesday he said, “attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, Ukrainian ballistic systems – these are the key elements. We must manufacture all of them.”
The German defense ministry statement suggested that some of these systems may be close to deployment. “A significant number of long-range weapons (are) to be produced within this year,” it read. “The first of these systems could be deployed by Ukrainian armed forces in just a few weeks.”
The Kremlin was quick to respond. “This is an entirely irresponsible position of Germany. Instead of trying to support a peaceful process, they are putting fuel on the flame,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN on Wednesday.
“They are simply trying to provoke further war, thus increasing their indirect involvement in this military affair,” he added.
Germany has long been one of Ukraine’s most generous supporters in terms of committed aid. In both military and humanitarian assistance, according to figures from the Kiel Institute, Germany ranks second only behind the United States.
In Berlin, both Zelensky and Merz spoke about their frustration with Russia regarding peace negotiations, in particular a promise about a memorandum from Moscow following a call between Putin and US President Donald Trump on May 19, which doesn’t appear to have yet materialized.
Merz said: “I would like to thank the American president in recent weeks. Moscow on the other hand is playing for time. The memorandum still has not been shared.” Germany’s leader added that that recent attacks across Ukraine “speak the language of aggression.”",['Sebastian Shukla'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/world/trump-not-informed-ukraine-kremlin-aide-intl,Top Kremlin aide says Trump ‘not sufficiently informed’ about Ukraine after US president lashes out at Putin,2025-05-28 00:00:00,"A top Kremlin aide has accused Donald Trump of being “not sufficiently informed” about the situation in Ukraine after the US president said Russian leader Vladimir Putin was “playing with fire.”
Putin aide Yury Ushakov was reacting to Trump’s Truth Social post on Tuesday, in which the president said: “What Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He’s playing with fire!”
Ushakov, a former Russian ambassador to Washington who was part of the negotiating team that Moscow sent to Saudi Arabia to meet US officials earlier this year, then questioned the accuracy of the information Trump receives.
“Trump says a lot of things. Naturally, we read and monitor all of this. But in many ways, we have come to the conclusion that Trump is not sufficiently informed about what is really happening in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation,” Ushakov told Russian state TV channel Russia-1.
Ushakov said that Trump appeared to be unaware of what he called “the increasingly frequent massive terrorist attacks Ukraine is carrying out against peaceful Russian cities,” and suggested Trump only sees Russia’s strikes, reiterating Moscow’s false claim that it is “striking exclusively at military infrastructure or the military-industrial complex.”
Ushakov’s remark – made to a favored Kremlin correspondent – came just after Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the Trump statements during a call with reporters.
Far from striking only military targets, Russia has recently intensified its aerial campaign against civilian targets in Ukrainian cities.
Dozens of civilians have been killed by Russian drone and missile strikes against residential areas in the past few weeks.
According to a tally compiled by CNN using Ukrainian Air Force data, four of the five largest drone attacks launched by Russia since the beginning of the full-scale war all came over the past two weeks.
At least 14 civilians, including three children from one family, were killed in Russian air attacks over the weekend.
The funeral for the three siblings – 8-year-old Stanislav Martynyuk, his sister Tamara, 12, and Roman, 17 – was held in their hometown of Korostyshiv in central Ukraine on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people, many in tears, filled the town square as their three white coffins were brought in. A local music school, where the trio studied, rang the “last bell” for them, a nod to the traditional long bell sounded for the graduating class at the end of their last school year.
After Russia launched the attack that killed the Martynyuk children, its largest ever aerial assault on Ukraine, Trump accused the Russian leader of having gone “absolutely CRAZY.”
“I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
The spat between Trump and Moscow escalated on Tuesday when the former Russian president and prime minister-turned-security-official Dmitry Medvedev responded to Trump’s threat by saying: “I only know of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!”
Medvedev served as the head of state when Putin had to step down to become prime minister due to a constitutional limit on the number of presidential terms one can serve – a limit that has since been lifted, guaranteeing the possibility that Putin can be president for life.
As the former prime minister and president of Russia, Medvedev was once among the most influential Russian officials, but he has become an increasingly fringe figure in recent years, known mostly for social media outpourings of hate and propaganda.
Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg called Medvedev’s comments “reckless.”
“Stoking fears of WW III is an unfortunate, reckless comment,” he said on X, adding that the United States is still waiting for Russia’s ceasefire proposal.","['Anna Chernova', 'Ivana Kottasová']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/politics/russia-sanctions-trump-ukraine-war,Trump considers new sanctions on Russia as he grows more furious with Putin,2025-05-27 13:26:18,"When President Donald Trump spoke last week by telephone with Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader committed to drafting and sending what he described as a “memorandum of peace” in the coming days laying out Russian requirements for a ceasefire with Ukraine, according to a US official and White House official familiar with the matter.
But more than a week after that phone call, the US has yet to receive the document from Russia, the sources said. Now, Trump is considering moving ahead with new sanctions on Moscow in the coming days as he vents his fury at the state of the conflict, according to people familiar with the matter.
Options were drawn up in the past several weeks to apply new measures punishing Moscow, but so far Trump has not approved them. The president said Sunday he would “absolutely” consider new sanctions in the aftermath of a sustained missile and drone bombardment that left many dead.
“He’s killing a lot of people,” Trump said of Putin on Sunday. “I don’t know what’s wrong with him. What the hell happened to him?”
And in a Truth Social post Tuesday, the president wrote: “What Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He’s playing with fire!”
The tension escalated on X early Tuesday evening with a back-and-forth between Dmitry Medvedev, a Russian security official and former president of that country, and Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Referencing Trump’s post, Medvedev wrote, “I only know of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!”
Kellogg retorted that the US was waiting on the memo from Russia.
“Stoking fears of WW III is an unfortunate, reckless comment by @MedvedevRussiaE and unfitting of a world power. President Trump @POTUS is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of RU Memorandum (Term Sheet) that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now,” Kellogg posted on X.
Trump could still decide not to apply new sanctions, the people familiar with the matter said, in keeping with past examples of him backing away from threats to target Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Trump has said privately he is concerned new sanctions could push Russia away from peace talks.
During their call last Monday, Trump told Putin that Russia and Ukraine should be communicating directly to negotiate a peace accord, and that Europe and the United States would help when needed, a White House official said.
After that call, Trump said on social media that the conditions for a ceasefire “will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be.” The call came just days after the first direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey. When those talks ended, the expectation was that a follow-up Russian memo would be shared with Ukraine.
But the plan for Russia to send its memorandum not just to Ukraine but also to the US indicates that Trump concluded the call without completely washing his hands of potential future involvement.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov the day before the Trump-Putin call and said they discussed the topic.
Lavrov told Rubio at the time that Russian officials would be “preparing a document outlining their requirements for a ceasefire that would then lead to broader negotiations,” Rubio told CBS’ “Face the Nation” last week. He added that if that came forward, along with Ukrainian proposals, “we can work off of that.”
“Hopefully that will be forthcoming soon,” Rubio added.
On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Moscow was working on the document.
“Russia continues the development of the draft memorandum regarding the future peace treaty with the definition of a number of positions, such as: principles of settlement, timeframes of possible conclusion of peace agreement (and) potential ceasefire for a certain time in case of reaching corresponding agreements,” Zakharova said.
“As soon as the memorandum is prepared, it will be handed over to Kyiv,” her statement continued. “We expect that the Ukrainian side is conducting the same work and will send us its developments simultaneously with the receipt of the Russian document.”
While the US waits on Russia – with mounting frustration – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday accused Putin of “simply playing games with diplomacy and diplomats.”
Meanwhile, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have begun lobbying Trump to significantly ratchet up US sanctions after the weekend attacks.
“All of us, by our public statements as well as private contacts, are pressing very, very hard,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN on Monday.
Blumenthal is a key figure behind a cross-party Senate bill, also sponsored by Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, which aims to impose “crippling” new measures on Moscow. It would include “secondary sanctions,” like massive 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian energy. More than 80 senators have signed onto the bill so far.
According to Blumenthal, the bipartisan bill – which could impact US adversaries like China as well as friendly Asian and European nations – was drawn up in “very extensive” consultation with US allies who may be affected by new sanctions on Russian energy imports. Germany, France and Britain are now “all for it, with 100% support,” he told CNN.
After speaking with Putin last week, Trump told European leaders on a telephone call that he would not join them, for now, in applying new measures on Moscow, even though he had previously signaled a willingness to take a tougher approach to Putin, a European official said.
Trump “believes, that right now if you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking, and there is value in us being able to talk to them and to drive them to get to the table,” Rubio told lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, a day after Trump and Putin spoke over the phone. “Like we will see, look they have to do this, no one is claiming that this is a guarantee.”
After Trump’s most recent comments, French President Emmanuel Macron voiced hope the US leader would change course.
“President Trump realizes that when President Putin said on the phone he was ready for peace, or told his envoys he was ready for peace, he lied,” Macron said Monday. “We have seen once again in recent hours Donald Trump express his anger. A form of impatience. I simply hope now that this translates into action.”
Trump has previously raised the notion of new sanctions on Russia’s banking sector and secondary sanctions on purchasers of Russian energy products. Both options have been drawn up, but it wasn’t clear what specific steps Trump was considering in the wake of Russia’s weekend bombardment in Ukraine.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/europe/russia-aerial-terror-ukraine-war-intl,"Russia is unleashing aerial terror against Ukrainian civilians to make it seem like it is winning, experts say",2025-05-25 00:00:00,"Third-grader Stanislav Martynyuk looks extremely proud in his school photograph. Hands folded on his desk; his eyes framed with spectacles that make him look like a serious – and adorable – 8-year-old scholar.
It was this image of Stanislav – alongside similar snaps of his sister Tamara, 12, and brother Roman, 17 – that was put on display at a makeshift memorial at their school in Korostyshiv and shared on social media after the three siblings died when a Russian strike hit their home over the weekend.
The trio was among at least 14 civilians killed over the weekend in the latest wave of Moscow’s escalating aerial assaults against Ukrainian cities.
Analysts say the brutal campaign is part of a deliberate strategy by Russia that is designed to create an impression that it has the upper hand in the conflict, undermine Ukraine’s morale and put more pressure on Kyiv’s Western allies.
Russia first began intensifying airborne attacks against Ukraine last fall, after it successfully scaled up domestic production of its own version of the Iranian-made Shahed drones, its most frequently used drone.
But the frequency and scale of these strikes increased again in January, after US President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Five of Russia’s biggest drone attacks were all launched since then. Four of the five came over the past 10 days, according to a tally compiled by CNN.
Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine one of his priorities – having said during the election campaign that he would bring the conflict to an end within 24 hours of taking office.
But despite the promises, Trump seems to have grown increasingly impatient with Moscow and Kyiv. He has been flip-flopping between threatening to punish Russia with more sanctions if it doesn’t sign up to a ceasefire proposal and suggesting he could walk away from the issue altogether.
Over the weekend, after Russia launched its biggest aerial assault against Ukraine since the start of the war, Trump said on social media that Putin “has gone absolutely CRAZY!” before telling reporters that he was “not happy with what Putin is doing.”
But Trump also slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for suggesting that “America’s silence” encourages Putin to continue his onslaught. He said Zelensky does his country disservice because “everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that should Ukraine “misbehave” in fighting against Russia with drones, it will “get hurt.”
No matter if peace negotiations are underway, or “if President Trump says something or not, Russia will ensure its security,” Peskov said.
The only way to win
Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said that Russia’s brutal aerial campaign is part of the strategy to create the illusion that it is winning the war, in an “effort to degrade Ukrainian morale and convince the West that a Russian victory in Ukraine is inevitable and that supporting Ukraine is futile.”
Putin knows that the only way Russia could win the war in Ukraine any time soon is if Ukraine’s Western allies, the United States chief among them, stop supporting Kyiv in its war efforts.
Ukraine’s European allies have seen an increase in instances of sabotage, cyber incidents and arson attacks linked to Russia, an attempt by Moscow to put more pressure on Kyiv-friendly governments by trying to show their voters that supporting Kyiv comes with a cost.
At the same time, Putin is successfully stalling the ceasefire talks proposed by Trump – while trying to appear cooperative and shift the blame on Kyiv.
Instead of refusing Trump’s ceasefire proposal straight away, the Russian president has been introducing new demands and blaming Kyiv for not accepting them.
When given an ultimatum, Putin ignored it and called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia – something Trump immediately endorsed, blindsiding Ukraine’s other Western allies.
Trump has repeatedly indicated he does not want US military assistance to Kyiv to continue as it was. Earlier this year, the US briefly suspended shipments of aid to Ukraine over Trump’s disagreement with Zelensky. While the aid has been reinstated, the incident gave a clear indication to Putin that Trump is willing to abandon Ukraine.
Trump has also made it clear he believed Ukraine is on the backfoot. He even told Zelensky he had “no cards” during the contentious Oval Office meeting in February, trying to pressure the Ukrainian leader into negotiations.
But while Russia does have air superiority over Ukraine, which allows Moscow to terrorize the Ukrainian population on daily basis, it is far from “winning” the war.
Leading Russia analyst Mark Galeotti previously told CNN that the situation on the ground in Ukraine is better described as both sides losing. “The thing though is that the Ukrainians are losing faster,” he said.
When Russia launched its full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin expected to take over the country within a few days.
That has not happened because Ukraine mounted a surprisingly strong defense. And as Western support for Kyiv increased, Ukraine was able to push back and reclaim large swaths of territory that were seized by Russia during the initial invasion.
The frontline in Ukraine has not moved in a significant way since Ukrainian forces liberated the southern city of Kherson in November 2023. Russia has advanced in some areas along the frontline, but it has not been able to break through or take over a major city.
Yet the consequences of the Russian strikes have been horrifying. At least 209 civilians were killed across Ukraine last month, the deadliest month since September 2024, according to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.
It was a particularly deadly month for Ukrainian children – the worst since June 2022. On top of 19 who were killed, 78 were injured.
May has been equally terrifying for Ukrainian civilians. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram that the weekend’s attacks showed once again that Russia’s goal is “fear and death.”
Klymenko said the parents of the three slain Martynyuk children were wounded in the strike, their mother seriously.
Roman, the oldest child, was just days away from graduating, the school where all three attended said in a statement.
Tamara’s teacher, Oleh Hodovaniuk, told CNN Monday was a very difficult day for the school.
Signs of the war were all around them. The school windows have been blown out by the pressure wave from the explosions. A memorial point at the school’s entrance was flooded with flowers and plush toys.
Hodovaniuk said the news shocked the community to its core and some children were so distraught they were unable to come to school and take part in the memorial.
“No one coordinated this, but most of the school came wearing black,” he said. “Tamara was very well behaved and modest, like all the children in her family.”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Kostya Gak']",en

Trump told Time magazine in April his goal of resolving the conflict in 24 hours “was said in jest,” but as the war continues well past his first 100 days in office, Trump has aired grievances with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
From berating Zelensky in the Oval Office with Vice President Vance in February and calling him a “dictator without elections” to an intimate one-on-one conversation in St. Peter’s Basilica in April, Trump’s relationship with the Ukrainian leader has seemed to improve of late. At the same time, Trump wrote in May that “everything out of his mouth causes problems.”
And while Trump often speaks of his “very good relationship” with Putin, it’s proving to take more than a phone call, threatening new sanctions, or calling the Russian president “absolutely CRAZY” to get him to change course in Ukraine.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/europe/germany-ukraine-russia-long-range-missile-intl-hnk,Kremlin criticizes move by Ukraine’s allies to lift ban on firing long-range missiles at Russia,2025-05-27 05:41:59,"The Kremlin has slammed a “dangerous” decision by Ukraine’s allies to lift the ban on Kyiv firing long-range missiles into Russia after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said there were no longer any range restrictions on Western-supplied weapons.
Speaking after days of Russia bombarding the Ukrainian capital and other regions with massive aerial attacks, the German chancellor said Monday that his country and other allies had lifted range restrictions.
“There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine. Neither from the British, nor from the French, nor from us. Nor by the Americans,” Merz said at an event held by the German public broadcaster WDR.
“In other words, Ukraine can now defend itself, even by attacking military positions in Russia, for example. It wasn’t able to do that until some time ago. With very few exceptions, it didn’t do that until a while ago either,” Merz explained.
On Tuesday, after his quotes were interpreted as an announcement of new policy, Merz said this “has been the case for months.”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov slammed Merz’s announcement on Monday, saying the lifting of restrictions was “rather dangerous,” according to Russia’s state-owned news agency TASS.
“If such decisions are made, they will absolutely go against our aspirations to reach a political settlement and the efforts being made within the framework of the settlement,” he said, according to TASS.
Russia has previously openly threatened that any lifting of restrictions on long-range weapons would mean war with NATO.
Putin has warned the West that Moscow would consider any assault supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack – and that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it was struck with conventional missiles.
The threat of using nuclear weapons was a significant escalation in rhetoric by the Kremlin – although it did not act on the threat once Kyiv started using UK and US made missiles to strike inside Russia’s territory.
Ukraine’s key allies had in the past resisted Ukraine’s requests to use Western-supplied weapons deep inside Russia. That has changed late last year, when former US President Joe Biden gave a green light to Ukraine to use the US-supplied long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, inside Russia.
But that, too, was a controversial decision that took months of discussion to reach. The US refused to even provide ATACMS to Ukraine for the first two years of the war, only delivering the missiles for the first time in April 2024. Some American officials worried about escalating the war, now in its fourth year, while others worried about the Pentagon’s dwindling weapons stockpiles.
Merz was appointed chancellor several weeks ago – and his declaration that Berlin would allow Ukraine to use German-made long range weapons to strike inside Russia stands in stark contrast with his predecessor Olaf Scholz, who had repeatedly rejected Ukraine’s calls to lift the restrictions.
However, Merz did not say whether Germany would supply Ukraine with its powerful long-range Taurus missiles – something he had supported when Scholz was still in power, Reuters reported.
The comments from Merz came in the wake of record-breaking drone and missile attacks on Ukraine over the weekend. Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing international pressure to accept a ceasefire deal, including from US President Donald Trump, who has grown increasingly frustrated by the slow progress.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit Berlin on Wednesday, Reuters reported, citing several sources.
Russia’s attacks over the weekend killed more than two dozen people, including children, as Ukraine urged Western allies to continue pressuring Moscow to end the war.
“Without really strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,” Zelensky said on Sunday.
Trump on Monday voiced increasing frustration with Putin, saying the Russian leader had “gone absolutely crazy” – while also criticizing Zelensky’s statements as causing “problems.”
Pressure is also building from within Trump’s Republican base, with a number of congressmen – including Sens. Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, and Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Don Bacon – urging the president to impose stringent sanctions on Russia.
“It is a time for honesty. Peace talks are having zero effect on Putin,” Bacon wrote on X. “The US and allies must arm Ukraine to the teeth.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/politics/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-war-analysis,Trump’s talk on Ukraine is cheap but the Kremlin has set him a pivotal test,2025-05-24 00:00:00,"When it comes to ending the war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump’s statements and social media posts have become meaningless.
Receding chances for a ceasefire and peace deal soon will depend instead on whether he finally finds the steel to reinforce his rhetorical lashing of President Vladimir Putin over the weekend with action.
The Kremlin is betting he won’t.
It dismissed Trump’s frustration with the most intense Russian drone attacks on Ukraine as a symptom of “emotional overload.” And experience suggests Putin can get away with calling the US president’s bluff. After all, Trump’s Truth Social critique of the Russian leader as “crazy” on Monday was leavened with a characteristic rebuke of the victim — Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Still, the intensifying Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians appear to be a deliberate Russian test for Trump, a week after his hyped call with Putin, which made no progress toward peace despite the White House spin.
There are two routes Trump can take, assuming he’s ready to abandon the embarrassing position of being constantly played by Putin.
He could impose new sanctions against Russia, which he previously argued would hamper diplomacy. He told reporters in New Jersey on Sunday this was “absolutely” a consideration. Trump could also save lives in Ukraine by emulating his predecessor Joe Biden and asking Congress to approve new shipments of arms and ammunition to the country.
But this option would mean a massive turnaround that would be embarrassing politically, since Trump’s opposition to spending billions of dollars in Ukraine is a foundation of his second presidency. And it would mean the president accepting that, as was the case for many of his recent predecessors, his belief that he could manage Putin was flawed.
There is another possibility — one that Ukraine and its European allies fear. Trump could throw up his hands and argue that neither side wants peace and it’s time for the US to walk away. Russia would then press on with its war of attrition and attacks on civilians. Its land grab would be validated, creating a disastrous precedent for European security and US disengagement.
This isn’t an academic prospect. An isolationist streak running through the MAGA movement meant that recent hints by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance that the US could step back seem like more than a mere negotiating tactic.
And one way to read Trump’s Truth Social post on Monday was as a smokescreen for a US withdrawal. “This is a War that would never have started if I were President. This is Zelenskyy’s, Putin’s, and Biden’s War, not ‘Trump’s,’” the president wrote.
The case for tougher US action
There’s one good reason why Trump might change his mind: His credibility is on the line after his bold predictions that he could end the war in 24 hours were exposed as a fantasy.
One option would be for Trump to introduce the secondary sanctions on Russia he has sometimes floated. These would target financial institutions, companies and other entities that continue to do business with Moscow.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal have a new bill that would impose stiff sanctions on nations that still engage with Russia. This could hurt US adversaries such as China. But it could also disrupt Trump’s relations with allies like India — a big customer of Russian cut-price oil. The senators already have 81 co-sponsors, meaning the bill could be quickly passed if Trump wanted, sending a tough message to Russia.
Trump could also boost Ukraine’s air defenses by donating or selling to Kyiv more Patriot missiles to combat cruise missiles that are complementing the murderous nightly drone barrage.
The dangers of escalating the war into a more direct confrontation between Russia and the West should not be dismissed. This was a major consideration for Biden, too, and the ex-president’s slow testing of Russian red lines was a constant frustration for his critics. But Trump’s caution makes Biden look like a hawk.
Still, perhaps Putin has finally pushed Trump into a long-delayed epiphany.
“There have been statements and expressions of irritation and frustration coming from President Trump and others in the administration before, even threats of sanctions, but so far nothing,” former US Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor told Isa Soares on CNN International on Monday. “So, the question will be, is this time enough to have these sanctions imposed? And not just the sanctions; there has to be support for the Ukrainian military as well.”
Retired US Army Major Mike Lyons thinks Trump may be creating political space for himself.
“Who’s that (Truth Social) message for? (He is) obviously saying that to Vladimir Putin, but I think he’s selling that to the American public to gauge whether or not it would be popular for him to get more involved and have the country more involved inside Ukraine right now,” Lyons told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. “I’d like to think that what he thought was as simple equation back when he first took over … he’s seeing now it’s a very difficult one to solve.”
America’s European allies are closely watching to see whether Trump follows through.
French President Emmanuel Macron said during a trip to Vietnam on Monday that after recently talking with Trump, he believes the US leader now understands that while “President Putin told him by telephone he was ready for peace” — and said the same to US envoys — “he was lying to them.”
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also sharpened his tone. He said there are now no limits on the range Ukraine could fire European weapons — meaning they could now strike deep into Russia. It was not immediately clear, however, whether he was referring to a new operational shift.
The allies seem to sense a moment when Trump’s mind could be changed after months of seeing him undermine their own efforts to force Putin to accept an immediate ceasefire.
But as usual, no one can be sure which way he’ll jump. One European diplomat said it was still difficult to say if the president’s condemnations of Putin really signaled a new approach but noted that Europe was obviously interested in more sanctions.
What the Kremlin believes about Trump
There are two problems with the notion that Trump has finally seen the light about the Russian leader.
First, he’s never been keen to criticize Putin.
Second, the Russian leader’s ruthlessness in waging war is hardly new, three years after an unprovoked and illegal invasion that has killed tens of thousands of civilians and sparked international war crimes arrest warrants.
This is why it’s risky to take Trump’s weekend rhetoric at face value. His comments served a political purpose in deflecting questions from journalists about his views on the latest atrocity in Ukraine. And he got good headlines on Memorial Day for getting tough on Putin. But recent history shows that once the moment passes, the president often moves onto something else.
“Talk is cheap, and we have been waiting for action,” former senior US national intelligence official Beth Sanner told CNN’s Phil Mattingly on Monday. “You have to pressure the party that’s a problem.”
“Putin doesn’t believe that Trump is going to follow through,” Sanner said.",['Stephen Collinson'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/26/europe/analysis-crazy-putin-trump-ukraine-latam-intl,"No, Trump. ‘Crazy’ Putin hasn’t changed. The question is, have you?",2025-05-26 18:11:10,"“I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him,” observed US President Donald Trump, reacting to the intensive Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine over the weekend.
In fact, the Kremlin leader seems pretty much unchanged, despite the urgings of the White House, merely continuing his policy of grinding war in Ukraine, in which aerial assaults have become an all-too-regular feature.
The real question is whether Trump has changed, or at least if his attitude toward Putin has started to shift amid what looks like an increasingly futile US effort to forge peace in Ukraine, something Trump bragged he could do – let’s not forget – in short order.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, certainly thinks a mental corner has been turned, telling reporters in Vietnam that Trump’s latest rebuke of his Russian counterpart as “absolutely CRAZY” means the US president “realizes” that Putin has “lied” on the war in Ukraine, adding that he hopes Trump’s words will “translate into action.”
But the record suggests otherwise.
This is the sixth time this term that Trump, who consistently says he has a strong relationship with Putin, has publicly expressed impatience or downright annoyance with the Kremlin boss.
Back in March, Trump revealed he was “pissed off” with Putin for refusing to agree to a 30-day ceasefire.
In April, Trump demanded “Vladimir STOP,” after a Russian missile strike on Kyiv left a dozen people dead.
“Maybe he doesn’t really want to stop the war and is just tapping me along,” Trump mused later.
The Trump scoldings have been routinely accompanied by expressions of personal disappointment and threats of possible retaliation, like secondary tariffs on “all oil coming out of Russia,” or unidentified “further sanctions.”
Asked again, after the latest rebuke of Putin, whether he would now consider putting more sanctions on Russia, Trump replied: “Absolutely.”
So far, there has been no real sign that Trump is prepared to use the substantial economic leverage at his disposal to force the Kremlin to rethink its hardline stance.
Not so in the US Senate, where a cross-party bill has been introduced to make it more difficult for Russia to fund its war.
The bill, now backed by 81 senators, not only proposes more direct sanctions on Russia, but also secondary sanctions, such as a massive 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian energy.
But the measures, which would seriously impact an already fragile and oil-dependent Russian economy, are super-controversial as they would also punish China, India and the European Union, which are all still major Russian energy consumers.
It is, of course, possible that Trump could now throw his weight behind the bill, or perhaps a watered-down version of it. But that would be a huge change in direction, given his consistent reluctance to confront and punish the Kremlin so far.
More likely, the latest upsurge in violence in Ukraine may further convince an already frustrated US president that he is simply unable to bring the warring parties together any time soon.
And, amid all his anger and bluster about Putin, Trump may simply choose to walk away.",['Matthew Chance'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/25/politics/trump-putin-ukraine-airstrikes,Trump says Putin ‘has gone absolutely crazy’ after major Russian attacks on Ukraine,2025-05-25 22:46:29,"President Donald Trump said Sunday that Vladimir Putin “has gone absolutely CRAZY,” after the Russian leader launched the largest aerial attack of Moscow’s three-year full-scale war on Ukraine.
“I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
Hours earlier, Trump had told reporters: “I’m not happy with what Putin is doing. He’s killing a lot of people, and I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin.”
Moscow launched overnight attacks on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in Ukraine, killing at least 29 people over three days and injuring dozens more, according to officials. The bombardment from Saturday into Sunday saw more drones and missiles launched at Ukraine than in any other single assault in three years.
Trump’s intervention, coming at a crucial moment in Moscow’s war, will be viewed with relief in the West as a signal that the White House has grown frustrated with Putin’s refusal to accept a proposed 30-day ceasefire in the conflict.
The Kremlin on Monday sought to downplay the significance of the remarks, categorizing them as an “emotional reaction.”
“This is a very important moment, which is associated with the emotional overload of absolutely everyone and with emotional reactions,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday.
He also said Moscow is “truly grateful to the Americans and personally to President Trump” for his efforts to bring Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table.
But the clash could have consequences for Russia. Trump also told reporters Sunday evening that he’s “absolutely” considering additional sanctions against Russia, which Kyiv has pushed for. Trump previously said he would not join in any new sanctions because he thought “there’s a chance” of progress, but remarked that could change.
But Trump also turned his criticism toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Sunday morning that “America’s silence” encourages Putin to continue his onslaught.
“Likewise, President Zelenskyy is doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does,” Trump wrote. “Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”
At least 25 people were killed in two rounds of overnight attacks in Ukraine over the weekend, including children, officials said, and dozens more people were injured. At least four people were killed overnight into Monday, officials added.
Russia has been intensifying its aerial bombardment of Ukraine as international pressure mounts on Putin to agree to the ceasefire plan, which has the backing of the United States and Kyiv.
“The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays. This cannot be ignored. America’s silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin,” Zelensky said Sunday morning.
Russia’s attacks set up another critical week in discussions over an end to the conflict. Earlier this month, teams from Kyiv and Moscow met face-to-face for the first time since the war’s early weeks, but the flicker of hope that surrounded those talks was seemingly extinguished when Moscow pressed ahead with its assaults on Ukrainian cities and again rejected calls to agree to a 30-day halt in fighting.
Some progress was made; both countries agreed to a massive prisoner swap, which began on Friday and will see 1,000 inmates released by each side.
But attention quickly returned to the fighting, which has intensified in recent weeks. Moscow last month claimed to have finally retaken the Kursk region, which Kyiv captured large sections of last summer, taking a significant piece of leverage back from Ukraine.
“We must be prepared for this war to last longer than we can all wish or imagine,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told public broadcaster ARD on Monday. “The question is whether the USA will continue to see it as its political and military duty to help Ukraine, and that is what we are trying to achieve.”
“Trump (is) obviously increasingly disillusioned with Putin from the massive attacks on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the weekend. In this respect, I hope that America stays on board,” Merz said.
Trump said Sunday he was “very surprised” about the latest Russian aerial assault, though just a week ago, Russia launched its largest drone attack against Ukraine – a day before Putin and Trump spoke on the phone. “We’re in the middle of talking, and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey on his way back to Washington.
Trump, who has often touted his good relationship with Putin, spoke with the Russian leader on Monday in an attempt to negotiate a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.
After the call with Putin, and subsequent calls with Zelensky and other European allies, Trump announced that “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War.”
Trump added that conditions “will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.”

At least 12 people were killed in the attacks across Ukraine, including children, officials said. Dozens more people were injured.
Among those killed were three children from the same family in the Zhytomyr region – west of Kyiv – according to Ukraine’s internal affairs minister Ihor Klymenko. He said their parents were hospitalized where the mother remains in a serious condition.
The children’s school expressed its condolences on Facebook. “We are in pain. The whole school family… We bow our heads in sorrow,” it said.
Russia has been intensifying its aerial bombardment of Ukraine as international pressure mounts on Putin to accept a ceasefire proposal.
“Each such terrorist attack by Russia is a sufficient reason for new sanctions against Russia. Russia is dragging out this war and continues to kill every day,” Zelensky said in a post on Telegram Sunday morning.
“The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays. This cannot be ignored. America’s silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin,” he continued.
Later on Sunday, US President Donald Trump expressed frustration with Putin, saying, “We’re in the middle of talking, and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities.”
Speaking to reporters on his way back to Washington, D.C., Trump said: “He’s killing a lot of people, and I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin. I’ve known him a long time. Always gotten along with him, but he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don’t like it at all.”
But Trump also turned his criticism toward Zelensky, saying in a post on Truth Social that the Ukrainian president was “doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”
Trump’s Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, called Russia’s overnight attacks a “clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents.”
The assault overnight into Sunday came despite the largest prisoner swap of the war taking place, a rare moment of cooperation in a brutal conflict that shows little sign of ending.
Ukraine’s Air Force said 367 aerial attack weapons - 69 missiles and 298 drones - were launched across 22 locations in Ukraine overnight into Sunday. It added 47 of those missiles and 266 drones were intercepted.
Russia’s previous record-breaking aerial attack on Ukraine was just last weekend when Russia launched 273 drones in one night.
“A difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night. The most massive Russian air attack in many weeks lasted all night,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on social media platform X.
In the capital Kyiv, air raid sirens blared for hours and residents were warned to stay in shelters in the early hours of Sunday as officials said the city faced a second night in a row of drone and missiles attacks. Civilian buildings in multiple districts were damaged as Russia mounted an attack using drones and rockets, authorities said.
The overnight assault came a day after another wave of Russian attacks, which killed at least 13 people.
Prisoner swap
Over 600 Russian and Ukrainian prisoners were exchanged Sunday, the final phase of the 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange the two sides had agreed to - the only significant outcome of the meeting between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul last week.
Russia’s defense ministry said 303 Russian servicemen were exchanged for the same number of Ukrainian prisoners of war.
Videos posted to social media by Zelensky and other officials show the hundreds of released Ukrainian men with shaved heads calling their loved ones on the phone whilst draped in Ukrainian flags. One video posted by the country’s ombudsman shows three men enjoying chocolate.
Over 600 prisoners were released on Saturday and almost 800 people were released on Friday during the initial phases of the swap.
Zelensky said Sunday he was “grateful to the team that worked around the clock to successfully implement this exchange.”
The Istanbul meeting was initially proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to a ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Kyiv’s European allies – which many saw as a clear attempt by the Kremlin leader to distract and delay.
Kyiv had hoped those talks would alleviate its casualties, but since then Russia has stepped up its bombardment.
“Without really strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,” Zelensky said on Sunday, calling on the US and Europe to impose fresh sanctions.
US President Donald Trump has said he would not join in any new sanctions on Russia because he thought “there’s a chance” of progress, but remarked that could change. He has also pointed to potential economic incentives if the war concludes, but the latest Russian assault will renew the sense among Kyiv and its allies that trade with the US is not high on the list of Putin’s priorities.
Meanwhile, Russia said that it also was attacked by Ukrainian drones on Sunday.
Russia’s defense ministry said it intercepted or destroyed around 100 attack drones. Most of those destroyed were over Russia’s central and southern regions, with 13 over the Moscow and Tver regions, the ministry said.
The defense ministry a day earlier claimed it had destroyed 94 Ukrainian UAVs over Russian territory, mostly over the Belgorod and Bryansk regions. Some UAVs were also shot down over the Kursk, Lipetsk, Voronezh and Tula regions too, it added.
The governor of the Tula region, Dmitry Miliaev, said Saturday three people were injured, including two who were hospitalized.

The swap started on Friday and will continue on Saturday and Sunday, with Kyiv and Moscow expected to swap 2,000 people – 1,000 from each side.
The agreement to release 1,000 prisoners on each side was the only significant outcome of the meeting between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul last week, which marked the first time the two sides have met directly since soon after Russia’s full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
“We are bringing our people home,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X, adding that 390 people arrived back to Ukraine on Friday. He said the group included 270 military and 120 civilians.
The Ukrainian Coordination Center for Treatment of Prisoners of War said three women and 387 men were among those released on Friday.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement that “270 Russian servicemen and 120 civilians” were returned to Russia. It said the civilians were captured by Ukrainian troops in Kursk, the Russian region to which Ukraine launched a surprise incursion last summer. Russia has since reclaimed most of the territory.
However, Zelensky said later that the Russian civilians returned by Ukraine were “Russian saboteurs and collaborators” who were arrested by Ukrainian law enforcement officers.
As in previous exchanges, the released prisoners were brought to a meeting place in several buses after being released by Russia at the Ukrainian border. Many were given Ukrainian flags and bracelets in Ukrainian colours at the border.
Photos and videos released by the Ukrainian government showed dozens of men wearing military fatigues, most of them with their heads shaved, posing wrapped in flags.
Several of the released men could be seen speaking to their loved ones over the phone, some breaking into tears as they hear the voices on the other side.
One video showed people from villages along the route of the convoy coming out with flags, greeting the returnees.
“I feel joy because I’m home, that’s all. I’m happy for you, for us, that we came… we prayed and asked for this to happen,” Vasyl Gulyach, who spent two and a half years in captivity, told CNN.
CNN also spoke to Anton Kobylnyk, a 29-year-old who spent over three years in captivity. “I am yours, I received your letter,” he told his girlfriend Yulia on the phone. “What you have done, waiting for me for these 37 months, is a very great feat on your part and an invaluable contribution to our relationship,” he told her.
At the same time, Russian soldiers who have been taken prisoner by Ukraine were handed over to Russian authorities at the border.
On the Ukrainian side, dozens of people waited for hours to greet the returnees at a meeting place in Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, many hoping to see their family members among those being brought back.
Many brought Ukrainian flags and photographs of their loved ones – in case any of the returnees would recognize them and give them information about their whereabouts.
As they waited, air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine, indicating that a Russian attack could be imminent.
Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been snatched by Russian authorities in occupied Ukraine and deported into Russia where they have been held without charge or trial.
Their status is complicated – because they have been detained illegally, Ukraine sees them as civilian hostages. Russia has, in some cases, claimed that they should be recognized as prisoners of war – something Kyiv has been reluctant to do because it could put civilians living in occupied areas of Ukraine at risk of being arbitrarily detained.
Agreement struck at the Istanbul meeting
Ukrainian and Russian authorities were not expected to publicly state that it was taking place until after it had been completed. However, US President Donald Trump broke that convention on Friday, announcing the swap on social media as it was unfolding.
The Istanbul meeting was initially proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to a ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Kyiv’s European allies – which many saw as a clear attempt by the Kremlin leader to distract and delay.
But while the return of hundreds of Ukrainian detainees will come as a huge relief to their families and loved ones, it remains somewhat underwhelming as the only tangible outcome of the highly touted meeting.
In his daily address, Zelensky said Friday’s prisoner exchange was the “only significant result” of last week’s meeting in Turkey, adding that Russia was blocking “everything else.”
Prisoner swaps have been happening regularly, most recently earlier this month.
The Ukrainian Coordination Center for Treatment of Prisoners of War said the exchange on May 7, which saw more than 200 Ukrainian service members return home, was the fifth swap this year and the 64th since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion.
The department said at the time that at 4,757 Ukrainian citizens have been released since March 2022.
Ukraine and its allies demanded that Russia agree to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Istanbul, but that did not happen.
Kyiv also offered direct talks between Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Eve Brennan']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/europe/russia-buffer-zone-ukraine-border-intl,"Russian forces are creating ‘buffer zone’ along Russia-Ukraine border, Putin says",2025-05-22 17:45:36,"Russian armed forces are creating a “security buffer zone” along the border between Russia and Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said Thursday.
“I have already said that a decision was made to create the necessary security buffer zone along the border. Our armed forces are currently solving this problem. Enemy firing points are being actively suppressed, the work is underway,” Putin said.
Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said the plan was “aggressive” and demonstrated that “Russia is the obstacle of peace efforts now.”
Thursday’s announcement was made ahead of an expected prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia – an outcome of last week’s face-to-face talks in Turkey, the first time the two countries have held direct talks at any level in three years.
The Russian president previously raised the possibility of creating a “buffer zone” in March during a visit to Russia’s Kursk region. He doubled down on the border plan during a meeting on Thursday with members of the government, during which he discussed the need to “restore and rebuild everything that was destroyed” in the border region.
“(We must) help people return to their native villages, settlements, (and) where security conditions allow, restore all transport and other infrastructure,” Putin added.
The Russian leader is planning on hosting a dedicated meeting to discuss the “restoration” projects, Russian state media reported on Thursday.
The announcement comes days after Putin visited Russia’s Kursk region for the first time since claiming to have completely retaken the region from Ukrainian forces, state media reported on Wednesday.
Twelve civilians – including two children – were injured in a Ukrainian strike on the town of Lgov in Kursk, the region’s acting governor said Thursday. According to an initial assessment, four vehicles, two houses and one apartment building were also damaged in the “massive” strike, the official said.
The Russian leader discussed the new buffer zone with municipal officials during his visit to the region, according to a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, published Wednesday.
The report claims that Putin was asked by a local official to create the buffer zone in Sumy region, to which Putin asked how many kilometers deep the zone should be.
Putin also said during his visit that Ukrainian forces were trying to move toward the Russian border, according to RIA Novosti news agency.
Kyiv launched its offensive into the Russian border territory last August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – and had held control of parts of the region until late last month. Kyiv had intended on using it as a key bargaining chip in any peace talks.
Such dialogue did not materialize until last week, when teams from Kyiv and Moscow met in person in Turkey to begin discussing an end to the war and agreed upon a prisoner exchange – 1,000 people from each side.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia had received Ukraine’s proposed list of prisoners of war to be exchanged in an expected swap, according to Russian state media.
“Yes, indeed, we have received it now,” Peskov was reported as saying when asked about the Ukrainian list.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X Thursday that Ukraine is “clarifying the details for each individual included on the lists submitted by the Russian side.”
“The agreement to release 1,000 of our people from Russian captivity was perhaps the only tangible result of the meeting in Turkey. We are working to ensure that this result is achieved,” Zelensky posted.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/21/europe/madrid-shooting-ukrainian-ex-politician-portnov-intl,"Madrid, Spain: Ukrainian ex-politician Andriy Portnov shot dead outside American school",2025-05-21 10:23:49,"Former Ukrainian politician Andriy Portnov, who worked as a senior aide to pro-Russian former President Viktor Yanukovych, has been shot dead outside his children’s school near the Spanish capital Madrid, Spanish authorities told CNN.
Portnov, 51, a lawyer and former lawmaker, was the deputy head of Yanukovych’s administration before it was ousted in Ukraine’s 2014 pro-democracy uprising.
He was shot several times by multiple assailants on Wednesday as he was getting into a car around 9:15 a.m. local time (3:15 a.m. ET), a Spanish police source told CNN, adding that the assailants fled into a wooded area. The Madrid region’s Summa emergency services said he had three gunshot wounds, including one to the head, and he died shortly after the first ambulance arrived on the scene.
The shooting took place outside the American School of Madrid, located in Pozuelo de Alaracon, an affluent suburb just west of Madrid. Portnov was the father of children who attend the school, a source close to the school told CNN.
The school sent out various urgent messages to parents following the incident, which took place shortly after morning drop-off, noting that all students were safe, according to another source close to the school. Police cordoned off the area outside the elite school, which has just over 1,000 students from the United States, Spain and several dozen other countries.
Portnov was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 for corruption and bribery under the Magnitsky Act. He was “credibly accused of using his influence to buy access and decisions in Ukraine’s courts and undermining reform effort,” according to the US Treasury Department.
The Magnitsky Act, signed into law in December 2012, blocks entry into the US and freezes the assets of certain Russian and pro-Russian government officials and businessmen accused of human rights violations.
Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry released a statement on Thursday confirming that a Ukrainian citizen was killed in Pozuelo de Alaracon, and said its embassy in Spain is in constant contact with law enforcement. No suspects have been arrested as of Thursday, the statement added.
The Security Service of Ukraine previously investigated Portnov’s possible involvement in Russia’s annexation of Crimea, but the case was later closed.
The former politician fled Ukraine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to an investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, when men of draft age were not permitted to leave.
Canada also froze his assets in 2014 as part of a crackdown on “corrupt foreign officials,” in relation to his work as a former adviser to ousted ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.
Portnov was appointed deputy head of Yanukovych’s administration in 2010, as well as the head of Ukraine’s Main Directorate for Judicial Reform and Judicial System. At the same time, Portnov became a member of the board of the National Bank of Ukraine.
Yanukovych was driven from office by mass demonstrations in Ukraine in 2014 after he turned his back on the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia.
Yanukovych then fled Ukraine for Russia, along with Portnov and other high-level former officials in the wake of the 2014 pro-democracy, pro-European Maidan protests. Portnov later returned to Ukraine in 2019.
Ukraine itself never imposed sanctions on Portnov.
In December 2024, media and civil society organizations in the country launched a petition demanding sanctions against him, alleging continued corruption aimed at controlling the Ukrainian judiciary, and highlighting concerns that he was going after critical journalists with lawsuits and threats. Portnov once released the personal data of several members of an investigative journalism project run by RFE/RL, who were looking into his dealings with the Ukrainian government.
The petition gathered 25,000 signatures, but Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers rejected it, citing insufficient grounds for sanctions.
Other killings
Portnov is not the only ally of former Ukrainian President Yanukovych who was killed after he was ousted from power.
In 2015, CNN reported on two high-profile shooting deaths in the Ukrainian capital – one of a former member of parliament with ties to Yanukovych, the other of a Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views.
At the time, those killings renewed speculation about a conspiracy to kill people close to Yanukovych, after three former members of parliament from his political party died by suspected suicide, found dead in their homes.
Spain has also experienced a recent spate of attacks related to the Russia-Ukraine war, and it has significant populations of expatriates from both countries.
In 2022, there was an explosion at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid, injuring one Ukrainian employee who was handling a letter addressed to Kyiv’s ambassador to Spain, officials said.
Other letter bombs followed, including one sent to the Spanish prime minister. A Spanish man was eventually arrested for the bombs, which a judge said were intended to disturb public peace and create pressure for Spain to suppress its support to Ukraine.

The Moscow branch of the committee, which deals with major criminal cases in Russia, said Tuesday that it had opened the case against Russian-born Galina Timchenko, co-founder and head of the Meduza publication.
Meduza, which reports in detail on Moscow’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor, said in an announcement posted online that Timchenko faced six years in prison if convicted.
The committee said the case was based on organizing the activities of an “undesirable organization” and posting videos “to foment protest sentiment and to involve the public in the activities” of such an organization.
Institutions deemed “undesirable” on grounds that they threaten Russia’s constitutional order can be subject to fines or orders to dissolve.
Timchenko, who had previously headed up prominent publications inside Russia, was last year declared a “foreign agent,” a designation that carries negative Soviet-era connotations and imposes difficult bureaucratic requirements.
Hundreds of Russian nationals have had the designation imposed on them.

Putin met with municipal leaders in the city of Kurchatov and visited the Kursk nuclear power plant, which is currently under construction, the Kremlin said, according to TASS news agency. Video footage posted by Russian state media showed the president dressed in a suit speaking with what appeared to be local volunteers.
The Kremlin head will hope that the visit, which appeared to take place on Tuesday but was announced on Wednesday, signals strength to the United States and the West at a time when Moscow has come under increasing pressure to pause its offensive against Ukraine.
It came a day after Putin’s Monday phone call with US President Donald Trump, during which Russia’s leader seemingly did not offer any clear concessions over the conflict.
Kyiv launched its shock offensive into the Russian border territory last August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – and had held control of parts of the region until late last month, when Moscow claimed to finally have recaptured it with the help of North Korean soldiers.
Putin said during his visit that Ukrainian forces were still trying to move toward the Russian border, according to RIA Novosti news agency. He also ordered an increase in the number of demining units in Kursk so displaced residents can return home, RIA Novosti reported.
Kyiv poured precious resources into holding onto its territory in Kursk during its months-long incursion, with the view of using it as a key bargaining chip in any peace talks. Such dialogue did not materialize until last week, when teams from Kyiv and Moscow met in person in Turkey to begin discussing an end to the war.
After Russia claimed to have retaken control of Kursk in April, Kyiv insisted its troops are fiercely battling to preserve their foothold in the territory. Last week Ukraine said it is still pursuing the ground war inside Russia.
“We are continuing our active operations in the Kursk and Belgorod regions – we are proactively defending Ukraine’s border areas,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address last Wednesday.
Putin again refused to commit to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington and Kyiv during his call with Trump earlier this week.
He said the Kremlin was ready to work with Ukraine on a “possible ceasefire for a certain period of time,” but neither Putin nor Trump discussed a timeframe for a possible truce, said Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov.
Following the call, the European Union announced new sanctions against nearly 200 vessels in Russia’s so-called “shadow-fleet” of tankers it says transport Russian oil for export to avoid Western sanctions.
Separately, Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of launching drone attacks on each other’s territory overnight into Wednesday.
Ukraine said it has destroyed 63 of the 76 long-range drones that Russia used to attack it last night.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/21/europe/russian-forces-ukrainian-troops-radio-chatter-intl-invs,Exclusive: Intercepted radio chatter and drone footage appear to capture Russian orders to kill surrendering Ukrainian troops,2025-05-15 00:00:00,"The radio crackled, but the order barked into it was clear: Capture the commander and kill the others.
The chilling exchange was part of a series of radio transmissions between Russian forces that Ukrainian officials say provide further evidence that Russian superiors are ordering soldiers to execute surrendering Ukrainian troops in violation of international law.
The radio communications intercepted by Ukraine, which were obtained by CNN from a Ukrainian intelligence official, appear to correspond in time with drone footage of a suspected execution by Russian soldiers in Ukraine’s eastern Zaporizhzhia region last November. The footage shows six soldiers lying face down on the ground, with at least two being shot at point blank range and another being marched away.
Those deaths are under investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors, who shared a screenshot of the drone video on social media after the incident. A Ukrainian official familiar with the investigation said that the same radio intercepts CNN had obtained were being examined as part of the inquiry into the killings.
CNN has not been able to independently authenticate the radio traffic, or confirm the communications were directly linked to the drone footage, but a forensic expert who analyzed the audio files said they did not appear to have been manipulated.
A leading United Nations investigator and a Western intelligence official told CNN the radio transmissions and drone footage were consistent with other instances of Russian forces allegedly executing surrendering Ukrainian troops.
Morris Tidball-Binz, the UN’s special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said the radio transmissions and drone footage suggest the killing of surrendered soldiers by Russian forces, as has been reported by the UN.
Tidball-Binz, who has investigated similar suspected executions, called such incidents “grave breaches” of international law, adding that he believes this conduct could only be authorized by the highest authorities in Russia.
They “would not happen with such numbers and frequency without orders – or at the very least consent – from (the) highest military commanders, which in Russia means the Presidency,” he said.
The Russian Ministry of Defense has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the allegations.
Russian officials have previously denied that Russian troops have committed war crimes and insisted that Russia treats prisoners of war in accordance with international law.
The alleged executions of prisoners of war, among other widespread charges that Russian military forces are responsible for war crimes in Ukraine, could complicate efforts by US President Donald Trump to bring a swift conclusion to the war. Trump has sought to end the fighting with an erratic approach that has often seen him side with Russian President Vladimir Putin and saw his administration briefly interrupt a State Department initiative to track alleged war crimes by Moscow.
A Western intelligence official told CNN he had reviewed the audio intercept files and “found them to be authentic, credible, and consistent with previously documented brutal executions. It is clear the soldier receives an order to execute the Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered.”
The official said he was examining similar material from other cases, which “strengthen the evidence of a directive from Russian commanding officers to kill Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered or are in the process of surrendering.”
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told CNN that Russian soldiers in the “Storm unit” of the 394th Motorized Rifle Regiment (127th Motorized Rifle Division), of the 5th Combined Arms Army, were involved in the November attack. The SBU said it had linked the same “Storm unit” to another suspected execution in the same area – the beheading of a captured Ukrainian soldier – and that it had charged in absentia Russian commanders from the unit who it said were responsible.
The Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office said it has, as of May 5, opened 75 criminal investigations into the suspected executions of 268 Ukrainian prisoners of war. It said the number of alleged executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war has been rising, with eight cases involving 57 soldiers in 2022, eight cases involving 11 soldiers in 2023, 39 cases with 149 soldiers in 2024, and 20 cases so far this year, with 51 soldiers.
Yurii Bielousov, head of the war crimes department at the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, said the rise was attributable to “instructions being given by top leaders of the Russian Federation, both political and military. We didn’t yet see a written order, but we had several examples of oral orders.”
Bielousov noted that Putin had said in March that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Russia’s Kursk region should be treated as terrorists. “Everyone knows how Putin treats people who they call terrorists. So, it’s almost a synonym for us to execute,” he said.
Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the secretariat at Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, said another possible explanation for the killings was that the Russian military wanted to avoid the logistical issues of capturing and managing prisoners. “It complicates military logistics, from their point of view. The Russian command made a simple decision… to shoot captured prisoners.”
‘Take the commander captive and kill everyone else’
The radio transmissions intercepted by Ukraine appear to capture a Russian commander, whose name and rank has not been established by CNN, talking to frontline troops. In the recordings, two Russians are referred to by their callsigns, “Arta” and “Beliy.”
The Ukrainian intelligence official shared a transcript of the radio transmissions, which noted they were intercepted at 12:05 p.m. local time, when the Ukrainian position was stormed, and continued until 12:31 p.m., when apparent fears over a Ukrainian drone arriving causes the Russian commander to order a retreat.
CNN could not independently verify the time the transmissions were intercepted.
The Russian commander can be heard ordering the killings on six separate occasions. According to the transcript of the intercepted transmissions, the commander’s first order was given at 12:22 p.m.
“Ask who is the commander. Who is the commander? Ask. Take the commander captive and kill everyone else,” he can be heard saying.
Four minutes later, he repeats the order twice.
“You do it. Take the commander captive, f**k off the others.”
“That’s it. Take the senior, get rid the f**k of the others!”
The commander frequently demands updates from his combat unit, who struggle to reply. “Someone, b*tch, answer, are the f**kers surrendering or not?”
The soldier referred to by the callsign “Arta,” who appears to be the main interlocutor, says they have not found a Ukrainian commander, only a “senior.”
The drone footage obtained by CNN only covers from 12:27 p.m. to 12:30 p.m., according to the time codes on the video, but there does appear to be a clear connection between commands captured in the transmissions and what happens on the ground in the drone footage.
At 12:28 p.m., the order is given on the radio a sixth time, and a soldier wearing a mask and a dark green uniform consistent with the Russian military can be seen emerging from the foliage, moving towards the captives.
“Get the f**k out! Take the senior, get rid of the others, f**k!” the commander said.
One Ukrainian soldier is visible in the grainy footage apparently gesturing to the Russians. Moments later, the masked soldier shoots him in the head. The voice of the Russian commander captured on the transmissions then asks if the killing is complete.
“Did you take them down? A question. Did you take them down? A question.”
“Arta! Arta! I’m Beliy, roger that!”
“We killed the f**king others.”
In the footage, another Ukrainian, presumably the commander who was motionless until that point, stands up, removes his body armor and is led away. The Russian commander radios his concern as a drone is seen rising over the smoke from an explosion. A retreat is then ordered.
The footage is consistent with satellite imagery of the village of Novodarivka reviewed by CNN and the Center for Information Resilience, a nonprofit that documents potential human rights violations. Images taken by Maxar Technologies in October 2024 show fields with similar vegetation, tree lines and craters to those visible in the drone video.
Robert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined the radio chatter for CNN. The audio recordings of the transmissions, which were sent to CNN in dozens of separate files, all appeared to be consistent, according to Maher. He said that he saw “no signs they were not authentic.”
The killing of surrendering Ukrainian troops is alleged by Ukrainian officials and international experts to be part of an orchestrated Russian policy. The incident appears to be one of the first times that intercepted radio transmissions have been linked to drone footage of a suspected execution.
CNN first reported on the alleged policy last September, detailing a video that showed an apparent execution by Russian troops of three surrendering Ukrainians near the embattled city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine last August.
Ukrainian officials claim the alleged executions are fueled by Russia’s cultural hatred of their opponents but are also meant for psychological impact. Okhrimenko said Russian soldiers had posted videos of the beheading and castration of Ukrainian troops to affect morale.
“Violence breeds violence,” he said, adding that Ukraine had increased training of its personnel to be sure Russian prisoners were held safely for later exchanges.","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Saskya Vandoorne', 'Gianluca Mezzofiore']",en

Russia launched 108 Shahed drones and “various types of decoy drones,” Ukraine’s Air Force said on its Telegram channel Tuesday, adding air defenses had destroyed 93 of them in the east, center and north of the country.
The strikes come after Trump and Putin spoke for nearly two hours on Monday – Trump from the Oval Office and Putin phoning in from a visit to a music school in the city of Sochi.
Following the call Trump said Kyiv and Moscow would begin ceasefire negotiations ‘immediately.’
But Putin said the Kremlin was ready to work with Ukraine on a “possible ceasefire for a certain period of time, provided the corresponding agreements are reached.”
Neither Putin nor Trump discussed a timeframe for a possible truce, said Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that Moscow is attempting to delay negotiations in order to continue the conflict. “It is obvious that Russia is trying to buy time in order to continue its war and occupation,” Zelensky wrote on social media after a discussion with Finnish President Alexander Stubb that touched on Trump’s call with Putin.
Putin has previously ignored a proposal from Washington and Kyiv for a 30-day ceasefire and last week snubbed Zelensky’s call to meet face-to-face for talks in Istanbul.
As the Turkey talks sputtered, Trump said he didn’t think there would be a significant breakthrough on peace talks until he spoke directly with Putin.
“Unfortunately, following the Trump–Putin phone call, the status quo has not changed,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky
European leaders decided to increase pressure on Russia through sanctions after Trump briefed them on the call with Putin, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in an X post late on Monday.
Trump said he would not join in any new sanctions on Russia “because there’s a chance” of progress.
“I think there’s a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse. But there could be a time where that’s going to happen,” Trump said.
Following the call Zelensky said discussions would take place about the future location of a further round of talks – which would be aimed first at achieving a ceasefire.
Russian state news agency TASS cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters that “so far, no specific decisions have been made regarding the location for the continuation of possible future contacts” with Ukrainian officials.
“We are primarily interested in a prompt settlement by eliminating the root causes of this conflict,” Peskov said.
Putin “wants Ukraine to surrender,” William Taylor, former US Ambassador to Ukraine and Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNN’s the Newsroom with Rosemary Church.
“He wants Ukraine to capitulate. He wants Ukraine to disarm… to be in a position where… the Ukrainians cannot defend themselves,” said Taylor.
“That’s what Putin means when he says ‘the root causes.’”","['Svitlana Vlasova', 'Ross Adkin']",en

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Russia-Ukraine
President Trump spent two hours on the phone with Vladimir Putin on Monday, hoping to learn when the Russian leader was going to end his war in Ukraine. However, no timeline was offered. Afterward, Trump posted on social media that Kyiv and Moscow had agreed to “immediately start negotiations” toward a ceasefire — although a Kremlin spokesperson said Trump and Putin did not discuss a timeframe for a possible truce. Despite Trump’s repeated assertions during his presidential campaign that he could end the war “in 24 hours,” he is now backing away from a direct mediating role, saying that negotiating the conditions for a ceasefire would be left to Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also spoke with Trump on Monday, said his goals were clear: full ceasefire without any conditions or preconditions, an exchange of prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children who were forcibly taken to Russia. Overnight, Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching even more attack drones.
2. Israel
Canada, France and the United Kingdom are threatening to take “concrete actions” — including targeted sanctions — if Israel doesn’t stop its renewed military offensive in Gaza and continues to block humanitarian aid from entering the enclave. Since Israel launched the offensive in northern and southern Gaza over the weekend, more than 400 people have been killed and over 1,000 others injured, according to a CNN count of this week’s Palestinian Ministry of Health data. Amid this increased pressure from allies, Israel announced it would allow five trucks into Gaza. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher described the delivery as a “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.”
3. Congresswoman charged
The Justice Department has charged Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal law enforcement during a protest outside an ICE detention facility. On May 9, Reps. McIver, Bonnie Watson Coleman and Robert Menendez Jr. visited the facility in Newark, New Jersey, because they said it was not up to date on necessary permits. At the end of their visit, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka tried to join them and walked inside the facility’s gate. Federal agents told Baraka to leave, then began to detain him once he left the fenced-in area. When the lawmakers and other protesters tried to stop the arrest, pushing and shouting ensued. Baraka was handcuffed, taken into custody and charged with trespassing, but those charges were later dropped. It is unclear whether the DOJ will charge Coleman and Menendez Jr. as well.
4. AI regulations
One of the items in President Trump’s “one big, beautiful” agenda bill is sparking protests, and it involves the regulation of artificial intelligence. If passed, the rule would prohibit states from enforcing any law or regulation related to AI models, systems or automated decision systems for 10 years. In response, more than 100 organizations have signed a letter that was sent to members of Congress calling the AI preemption provision “a dangerous giveaway to Big Tech CEOs.” “This moratorium would mean that even if a company deliberately designs an algorithm that causes foreseeable harm — regardless of how intentional or egregious the misconduct or how devastating the consequences — the company making or using that bad tech would be unaccountable to lawmakers and the public,” the letter, provided exclusively to CNN ahead of its release, stated.
5. Abandoned chicks
Thousands of chicks have died after they were left for days without food or water inside an abandoned postal truck. The reason why a truck filled with live birds was left unattended at a Delaware mail distribution center is under investigation. It’s also unknown why the USPS didn’t complete the delivery to the recipients who ordered the birds and were likely equipped to care for them. In the meantime, a local animal shelter has spent more than two weeks desperately trying to nurse and re-home the estimated 2,000 chicks who managed to survive the ordeal. Pennsylvania-based Freedom Ranger Hatchery raised the chicks for their weekly distribution to clients across the country, and due to biosecurity concerns, cannot take the chicks back.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/politics/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-ceasefire-talks,Peace in Ukraine looks further away after Trump’s call with Putin,2025-05-20 04:00:50,"So much for Donald Trump’s “force of personality” forcing Russian President Vladimir Putin to prove he wants to end the war in Ukraine.
The president’s hyped-up phone call with his Russian counterpart on Monday mostly served to highlight how far away any such breakthrough may be.
And more importantly, looking ahead, it raised new questions about how involved Trump really wants to be and widened transatlantic divisions on ending the war.
Ukraine and its European partners are pushing for a 30-day ceasefire to allow time for talks on a permanent peace agreement to start. Moscow has refused, insisting on talks now on a final deal. Since this process could take months, it looks like a ruse to allow Russia to press ahead with its offensives that are killing innocent civilians.
By announcing after his call with Putin that Ukraine and Russia would now hold talks “as only they can” on a ceasefire and ultimately an end to the war while the fighting rages, Trump sided with his friend in the Kremlin.
Trump also added new ambiguity to an increasingly toothless peace effort on Monday. He did nothing to quell an earlier suggestion by Vice President JD Vance that the US might simply wash its hands if there’s no progress. “I tell you, big egos involved, but I think something’s going to happen. And if it doesn’t, I just back away and they’re going to have to keep going,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office after the call.
Threatening to walk away is a classic dealmaker’s gambit. But given the administration’s extreme skepticism of aiding Ukraine, this might not be a bluff.
Trump also left the impression that the US would play a less direct role while Russia and Ukraine talked. He launched a vague trial balloon that the Vatican and the new American Pope Leo might get involved. Most observers believe that there will be no peace unless America exerts maximum leverage.
“It feels to me that the president maybe didn’t really try to pressure Putin at all. It’s good that they had a two-hour conversation but coming out of that what do we have?” asked Beth Sanner, a former deputy director of national intelligence.
“We have Putin continuing very maximalist demands … an agreement to talk about a framework for talking about a future peace deal and possibly a ceasefire that would come after agreements for many things,” Sanner told CNN’s Boris Sanchez.
“This is a call that I think it’s really hard to see this in any other way than Putin seemed to get exactly what he wanted.”
Russia seems very happy with the call
As ever, there was mystery about the full extent of Trump’s conversation with Putin, to whom he has often shown great deference.
Outsiders know only what the Kremlin and the White House want them to know about how it went. But Russian officials offered a few tantalizing hints of the atmosphere of the call. “I will tell you that conversations of such duration are rare when both presidents … neither of them wanted to end the conversation and hang up,” Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov said Monday in comments that will do little to stem concerns among Trump critics that he’s an easy mark for Putin.
Before it took place, Monday’s call looked like it might mark a pivot point in the so-far fruitless US effort to end the war. After all, Trump told Fox News in an interview during his Middle East tour last week it was “turkey time,” raising expectations that he’d get tough with Putin.
And on Sunday, the president’s envoy Steve Witkoff said on ABC News that “the president has a force of personality that is unmatched.” Witkoff added, “He’s got to get on the phone with President Putin, and that is going to clear up some of the logjam and get us to the place that we need to get to. And I think it’s going to be a very successful call.”
But Trump won’t use the leverage that the US does have – for instance, it could toughen sanctions against Russia or send more arms and ammunition to Ukraine.
Asked by reporters in the Oval Office why he wouldn’t impose new sanctions, Trump replied, “Because I think there’s a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse.” He cautioned, “But there could be a time where that’s going to happen.”
Absent a deadline or more specificity, however, Trump’s threat comes without steel. It looks rather like a line designed to ease pressure on himself rather than to get Putin’s attention.
Trump also renewed his complaints about the cost of the war in Ukraine, making clear that he won’t emulate the military aid sent to Kyiv by the Biden administration, without which the effort to repel Russian forces will be severely constrained. “We gave a massive amount … It’s just a shame,” the president said.
Zelensky, politely, contradicts Trump’s position
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X after the talks that he had spoken with Trump twice on Monday – once before the US leader talked with Putin, and afterward for a joint briefing with European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
Given the strategic necessity for Zelensky of avoiding new blowups with the president following their Oval Office argument in February, he was diplomatic. But in a long statement on X, Zelensky contradicted Trump’s formula. He called for stronger sanctions on Russia if it is unwilling to stop killing Ukrainians. He proposed direct negotiations with Russia at the Vatican, in Turkey or in Switzerland but said they must involve European and American representatives. And he warned, “It is crucial for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace, because the only one who benefits from that is Putin.”
“This is a defining moment. The world can now see whether its leaders are truly capable of securing a ceasefire and achieving real, lasting peace,” Zelensky wrote, in a comment that could be read at face value or as a critique of Trump’s efforts.
Trump often says that he wants to devote his second term to peacemaking. And if he’s sincere, he could leave the world in better shape.
“My whole life is like deals – one big deal,” Trump said Monday.
But his efforts so far are desultory. If anything, combat in Ukraine and Gaza has intensified since he took office. Trump claimed a notable humanitarian win last week by securing the release of the last living US hostage in Gaza by agreeing to indirect talks with Hamas that bypassed Israel.
But Trump’s receding interest in ending the war launched after the October 7, 2023, attacks has led to a vacuum. Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opened a new offensive aimed at controlling the entire enclave, where tens of thousands of Palestinians are starving. Their plight is an ill omen for Ukraine if Washington loses interest there, too.
Elsewhere, the president claimed credit for ending a terrifying escalation between India and Pakistan over Kashmir this month. But India – despite its close ties to the White House – disputed claims that the US intervention was decisive.
Such conflicts are brewed from decades of historical and nationalistic grievances. And each may be existential for the leaders concerned. So it’s hardly surprising that those involved are not being budged by Trump’s endeavors, which are superficial compared to the standards of historical peace US peace drives in places like the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia. Such wars run on generational clocks. Trump’s timetable is days and weeks.
Putin and Trump are both ‘tapping along’
“I believe Putin wants to do it … if I thought that President Putin did not want to get this over with, I wouldn’t even be talking about it,” Trump said in the Oval Office.
But it’s harder than ever to be optimistic that the Russian leader truly wants to end the war soon.
Of course, the conflict has been ruinous to Russia’s economy and has killed tens of thousands of young Russians. But in its readout, Russia said that Putin stressed that for the war to end, its “root causes” must be addressed. This includes specious claims that Ukraine needs to be “de-Nazified” (in other words, that Zelensky and democratic governance must be toppled), and severe restrictions must be imposed on the country’s sovereignty, political system and right to decide its own destiny.
Sure, Putin wants peace, but only on terms that it would be impossible for Ukraine to accept while remaining an independent nation.
A few weeks ago, Trump called for Russia to stop attacking civilians and wondered aloud whether Putin was “tapping me along.” By giving Russia what it wanted on Monday, it’s fair to ask whether Trump is less tapped against than tapping.",['Stephen Collinson'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/19/europe/analysis-putin-trump-phone-call-ukraine-latam-intl,Putin just showed Trump how little he needs him,2025-05-19 00:00:00,"“The root causes of the conflict.”
These were startling words from a man purportedly on the path to peace.
But it is the nub of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s position of what must be solved for peace, after two weeks, or three months, depending on how you count, of mounting pressure for an immediate unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Unbothered, taking this most consequential of calls at a music school on the Sochi coast, the Kremlin head has returned to the start – to his false narrative about this war of choice being sparked by NATO expanding too fast.
Five other, different words emerged hours before, that may have echoed in Putin’s ears while he spoke to US President Donald Trump for two hours.
“It is not our war,” said Vice President JD Vance earlier. Reprising his role as the harbinger of very bad news for European security, Vance held out again this remarkable non-threat: that the United States might pull out of the war – presumably from both diplomacy and aid to Ukraine – unless Russia takes steps toward a peace deal it adamantly does not want. Washington backing off is exactly what Russia yearns for, and to earn this dream outcome, it seems Putin has to do absolutely nothing, bar continue to wage a brutal war.
Moments after the call, Trump already sounded like a man stepping back from the fray. Five days earlier he had been the febrile intermediary, the peacemaker willing to bridge the enmity between Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky for a meeting in Turkey. But after his Monday call with Putin, he simply said Ukraine and Russia must talk directly, “as only they can.” He even passed the task to the home of the new American Pope, the Vatican, as a possible venue. The United States may not be out of the process entirely, but it talks like it wants someone else to lead it.
The last 10 days have been a vivid reminder of how little Putin really needs POTUS or his approval. And the logic is simple.
For the best part of three years of war, Russia’s state media has been lecturing its audience they are not only in conflict with Ukraine, but also with all of NATO, including the United States. The presidency of Trump has created a small window in which the Kremlin might talk its way into a better position, or even alleviate the pain of some Western sanctions. But it does not change the central calculation or message of the Kremlin: this is an existential war, about re-establishing their pre-eminence in their near abroad. So much pain and loss has been inflicted on the Russian people through staggering war casualties that delivering middling to poor results might significantly limit the longevity of Russia’s leadership. This isn’t a war they can be seen to have lost.
The limits of what the United States can offer Russia at the moment, in terms of leverage, are visible from space. Yes, the US could escalate sanctions, even, as Trump mulled last week, adding “secondary sanctions” against Russia’s financiers, the oil purchasers of India and China. But that would cause another trade-like rift with world powers that Washington has just made good with. The US could alternatively ease sanctions to coax Russia into concessions. But those kid gloves would irk their European allies, and likely falter without Europe’s practical support.
Any further steps to cause Moscow pain would likely mean Trump had gone further to punish Russia than his predecessor Joe Biden did. That is not the MAGA geopolitical gameplan. It would deepen US involvement in a war where there is, frankly, no end in sight, until one side falters, or sees drastic change in political leadership.
Ukraine in 2025 is a bleak prospect. But the central tenet of European policy was the best choice in a world of ghastly options: Moscow could only be forced into reducing its goals if it saw an infinitely united NATO before it. Its economy, reserve wealth, manpower, or hardware might falter – only one needs to for the war machine to stutter. It is bleak, but Europe is left with little choice. Ukraine has no choice at all.
Trump felt he has a choice. His business acumen sees no merit in a long-term investment in a conflict with an enemy you’d prefer to get along with, the best outcome from which is to return Europe to the peace it knew before. There is no deal to be made here. Putin is not buying anything; he seeks to conquer and take. Trump has nothing to sell, bar the United States’ backing for its traditional allies. There is no way Putin and Trump can both win and retain their stature.
American leadership has for decades been built around something other than good, small deals. Its benevolence toward allies, vast soft power, and military hegemony, has left it the biggest economy on earth, with an undefeatable currency – itself a very good and huge deal.
But Trump sees America’s role as smaller. This may be the moment Trump finally understood Putin as someone who really doesn’t seek his approval or allegiance, and stepped back. If it is, the United States too has stepped back from decades of calling the shots, admitted the limits of its focus and power, and left the most important peace deal since the 1940s to a Hail Mary pass at the Vatican.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/19/politics/trump-putin-call-ukraine-russia,Trump says Russia will ‘immediately’ work toward a ceasefire with Ukraine after phone call. But Putin seems unmoved,2025-05-19 00:00:00,"For President Donald Trump, Monday’s phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin amounted to a major occasion — meant to ascertain his counterpart’s willingness to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an end.
“I said when are we going to end this, Vladimir?” Trump recounted later to reporters. “I said when are we going to end this bloodshed, this bloodbath?”
For Putin, it seemed to be a much less momentous event. Unlike Trump, who conducted the two-hour conversation from the Oval Office and previewed the call ahead of time in all capital letters on social media, Putin did not clear his schedule. He phoned in from a school for gifted children in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, squeezing in Trump amid a tour of the facilities.
Afterward, it was evident each man viewed the call with differing levels of consequence.
“If I thought that President Putin did not want to get this over with, I wouldn’t even be talking about it. I’d just pull out,” Trump said. “I think he’s had enough.”
While Trump proclaimed in an optimistic social media post that the call “went very well” and that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to “immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire,” Putin made clear in his own comments he wasn’t budging from his maximalist demands to end the violence.
Without any major progress toward an immediate ceasefire, Trump sought to emphasize what he described as an excellent “tone and spirit” shared with the Kremlin leader. Putin, meanwhile, described the call as “meaningful and frank.”
The divergent assessments of the leaders’ third phone conversation this year seemed to underscore the struggles Trump is facing in bringing about an end to the three-year war, which he described this week as a “bloodbath.” Even as Ukraine has agreed to an immediate 30-day ceasefire, Putin has refused, leading to questions among Trump’s aides about whether Moscow is simply stringing Trump along — something the president himself has previously suggested.
But Trump didn’t appear to hold that view after the call, telling reporters Monday afternoon that he believes Putin is interested in peace.
“I do,” Trump said at an unrelated White House event, without expanding further. Yet later in the day, he suggested he would step away if Putin didn’t make good on his pledge to end the war.
“Very big egos involved. I tell you, big egos involved, but I think something’s going to happen,” Trump said. “And if it doesn’t, I just back away and they’re going to have to keep going.”
Yet Putin has only ramped up drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, including this weekend on its capital, Kyiv. Trump has previously criticized those assaults as counterproductive but made no mention of the latest attack as he recounted his call with Putin.
Although Trump seemed confident after Monday’s conversation that the two countries would reach a resolution, there was little to indicate anything had changed in Putin’s approach.
Trump told reporters ahead of the call that he and Putin must meet soon to discuss a resolution to the conflict, but there was no mention in either side’s readout of a forthcoming summit. And despite Trump’s repeated assertions that only he could end the war, he said Monday that negotiating the conditions for a ceasefire would be left to Ukraine and Russia, apparently backing away from any direct mediating role.
“The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Ahead of Monday’s call, Trump spoke with European leaders Sunday evening about ways to pressure Moscow into agreeing to a ceasefire. That included applying new sanctions “if Russia failed to engage seriously,” according to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
Trump did not mention new sanctions after the call, however, and instead pointed to potential economic incentives if the war concludes.
“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath’ is over, and I agree. There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED,” Trump wrote. He also said that Ukraine “can be a great beneficiary on Trade.”
Trump said he informed various leaders about the contents of the call, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.
“The Vatican, as represented by the Pope, has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations. Let the process begin!” Trump added.
Zelensky spoke to Trump twice Monday, once shortly before the US leader spoke with Putin, and once after, the Ukrainian president told reporters at a press briefing Monday evening.
In the phone call after Trump spoke with Putin, European leaders discussed the need for more sanctions on Moscow. Zelensky said the US still needs to be “pressured” to agree to implement further sanctions.
The Ukrainian leader said discussions would take place about the future location of a next round of talks — which would be aimed first at achieving a ceasefire. Turkey, Switzerland and the Vatican were among the possible locations, he said.
Before the call, Trump had expressed increasing frustration with the Russian president’s refusal to strike a peace deal with Ukraine. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said shortly ahead of the conversation on Monday that Trump has “grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,” adding that his goal “is to see a ceasefire and to see this conflict come to an end.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/19/europe/russia-ukraine-war-trump-putin-intl-latam,Having Trump’s ear is the new frontline in the Russia-Ukraine war,2025-05-18 00:00:00,"Make no mistake, the real battle in the Ukraine war right now isn’t in the skies over Kyiv or Dnipro where Russian drone strikes have intensified, dramatically, in recent days.
Nor is the slow, grinding progress being made by the Russian army on the brutal frontlines of eastern Ukraine how the conflict, now in its third year, will be decided.
No, the crucial fight being slugged out between the warring parties and their allies is for the ear of US President Donald Trump, who seems increasingly frustrated with efforts to broker peace.
And that’s why his phone call, expected to take place with Russian President Vladimir Putin later today, may be of such pivotal importance.
Moscow and Kyiv are both vying to demonstrate it is the other who is the real obstacle to peace, hoping to swing Trump’s changeable opinion, at least for a while, their way.
European officials say they will also be speaking to Trump ahead of his call with Putin, amid concerns that Trump’s view on the conflict may be shaped by whom he speaks to last.
Just last month, after speaking to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky at Pope Francis’ funeral, Trump made some of his most critical remarks towards Putin, condemning the Russian leader for launching a missile attack on Kyiv, adding he couldn’t say for sure whether the Russian leader was serious about ending the war.
As long as Monday’s call lasts, Putin – who has refused to accept a 30-day ceasefire demanded by President Trump and agreed to by Ukraine – will have that presidential ear all to himself. He could pour into it whatever business inducements, flattery or poison Putin calculates will work best.
Trump and Putin already seem to share an unshakeable conviction that it is them alone who have the personal authority and skills to settle the Ukraine war, while the Europeans and the Ukrainians themselves will ultimately do as they are told.
Underwhelming talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul last week – the first directly between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators for years – seem to have underlined President Trump’s own sense of centrality to a deal. It has encouraged him to reinsert himself, by calling Putin directly, into peace efforts from which he had only recently threatened to walk away.
The big Ukrainian fear is that the two leaders will cook up their own peace plan over the phone with President Trump – who says he’ll call his Ukrainian counterpart Zelensky afterwards – then potentially seek to impose Putin’s terms under a renewed threat of withdrawing vital US military and economic aid.
President Trump has leverage on Russia, too, if he chooses to use it. With mounting casualties and a strained economy, the Kremlin undoubtedly wants to avoid pushing an angry and rebuffed Trump towards restoring and possibly redoubling US support for the Ukrainian war effort.
As ever, the problem remains that neither Russia nor Ukraine is currently willing to accept each other’s minimum terms, to compromise enough to satisfy the other side.
That doesn’t mean talks – whether direct, face-to-face, or on the phone – are pointless. If nothing else, they can highlight how far apart the two sides really are.
But what that may mean is that, even under US pressure, even after a direct phone call with President Trump, both Moscow and Kyiv may still choose to fight on.",['Matthew Chance'],en

1. Biden
Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer, one that has spread to his bones. Biden, 82, and his family are reviewing treatment options with his medical team. In response to the news, well-wishes came from across the political world. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. Former President Barack Obama, who tapped Biden, his then-vice president, to lead the White House task force aimed at curing cancer, shared his thoughts on X as well: “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.”
2. Russia-Ukraine
President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to speak by phone today about ending Russia’s war in Ukraine. Yet over the weekend, instead of ceasing hostilities, Russia battered Ukraine with its largest drone attack since the invasion began in 2022. Russia launched 273 drones in one night, the Ukrainian Air Force said, predominantly targeting the central Kyiv region. More strikes hit overnight, killing at least two people and injuring 13 others, local authorities said earlier today. “I think Ukraine has done a lot to demonstrate that they are interested in ending this war and ending it however it needs to be ended,” US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said in a Fox News interview on Sunday. He also said Russia needs to show it is serious about peace.
3. Severe weather
A violent storm system cut a path of destruction through several states and left dozens dead over the weekend. At least 18 fatalities were reported in Kentucky after a “large, extremely dangerous” tornado swept east. “I’ve now been governor for at least 14 federally declared disasters, 13 of them weather. And this is one of the worst,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at a news conference. “It’s one of the worst in terms of the loss of human life. It’s one of the worst in terms of damage.” Significant destruction was reported in Grinnell, Kansas, where homes were flattened, roads blocked and vehicles overturned. Houses and buildings in three counties were also damaged or lost in storms that produced at least two tornadoes in Colorado. Residents of St. Louis experienced an EF3 tornado, which had winds up to 152 mph. At times stretching a mile wide, the twister traveled at least 8 miles, claimed at least seven lives and damaged about 5,000 buildings.
4. Brooklyn Bridge
A Mexican training ship called the Cuauhtémoc crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night. Two people died after falling from its masts and 19 others were injured. Known as the “Ambassador and Knight of the Seas,” the ship had just spent five days docked at the South Street Seaport Museum. It was on a global goodwill tour and en route to Iceland at the time of the incident. According to the NYPD, a preliminary investigation has determined that the ship “experienced a mechanical malfunction.” Although the bridge was temporarily closed after the collision, it sustained no visible damage and appeared to be left structurally intact. The collision of the Cuauhtémoc with the Brooklyn Bridge comes just 16 months after a massive cargo ship plowed into Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge.
5. Escaped inmates
A massive manhunt is underway for a group of inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail on Friday. Ten men fled after breaching a wall behind a toilet, and so far, only three have been recaptured. Now, authorities are asking for the public’s help in tracking down the remaining seven escapees. Both the governor of Louisiana and the FBI are offering rewards for information leading to their apprehension. “Unfortunately, they have friends and family members who are helping them and concealing them and helping them move, which makes law enforcement’s job more challenging. We end up getting there just a little too late,” Louisiana State Police Superintendent Colonel Robert Hodges said. The inmates, who range in age from 19 to 42 years old, face a wide array of charges, including aggravated assault, false imprisonment, armed robbery, domestic abuse and murder.

Russia launched 273 Shahed drones in one night, the Ukrainian Air Force said Sunday, predominantly targeting the central Kyiv region, where they killed a 28-year-old woman and wounded three others, including a 4-year-old child, according to the region’s governor.
More strikes hit overnight, killing at least two people and injuring 13 others, local authorities said Monday. The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched a further 112 drones in the early hours of Monday, attacking the regions of Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Cherkasy and Kirovohrad.
The barrages came as Trump said he would speak to Putin by phone on Monday, which the Kremlin has confirmed.
The Russian leader has previously ignored a proposal from Washington and Kyiv for a 30-day ceasefire and last week snubbed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s call to meet face-to-face for talks in Istanbul.
Trump has said he doesn’t think there will be a significant breakthrough on peace talks until he speaks with Putin.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russia is “grateful to the American side” for its mediation efforts, adding, “if they really help us achieve our goals by peaceful means, then this is indeed preferable.”
The US president is growing frustrated with Putin, Finland’s President Alexander Stubb told local media on Sunday, after he spoke with Trump by phone the day before. “Zelensky is patient, but Trump is starting to grow impatient” toward Putin, Stubb told a press conference in Estonia.
Meanwhile, Russian forces downed 75 Ukrainian drones over the weekend, state-run news agency TASS reported Sunday, citing Moscow’s defense ministry.
Days of back-and-forth
These latest Russian aerial assaults come after a drone attack on a bus in Ukraine’s northeastern region of Sumy killed at least nine people and injured seven Saturday, just hours after the two countries met for the first direct peace talks since the early weeks of Russia’s 2022 invasion.
The negotiations in Turkey failed to produce a major breakthrough. The two countries discussed a possible meeting between their presidents, a ceasefire and agreed a prisoner swap.
The talks capped days of back-and-forth: Putin called for the face-to-face meeting but did not attend, instead sending a junior delegation after rejecting Ukraine’s proposal of a 30-day ceasefire.
During the talks, Russia demanded Ukraine cede land that was still under Kyiv’s control, a source familiar with Friday’s negotiations told CNN, a position Ukraine has long dismissed. The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Poland called Russia’s stance in the talks “unacceptable.”
In a TV interview with a Russian state media journalist released Sunday, Putin said he wanted to “eliminate” the causes of the conflict. The footage had a date banner reading March 27, but its release Sunday perhaps signals Moscow’s unchanged stance ahead of any future talks.
Zelensky, for his part, said he had had a “good meeting” Sunday with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Italy, where the trio discussed Friday’s peace talks.
They also “touched on” Russian sanctions, the battlefield situation and future prisoner swaps, the Ukrainian president added in a post on social media.
Sunday marked the first meeting between Zelensky and Vance since their spat in the Oval Office in February, where the vice president castigated the Ukrainian leader for purportedly not demonstrating enough gratitude for American support.

While the two sides discussed a possible meeting between the two countries’ leaders, a ceasefire and agreed a prisoner swap, there was no major breakthrough and since then Russia’s aerial assault continued.
The drone attack took place Saturday morning in the city of Bilopillia in the Sumy region, local authorities said, with Oleh Hrihorov - head of Sumy’s military administration - saying that seven people were injured, three of whom were in critical condition.
“This is not just another shelling – it is a cynical war crime,” Ukraine’s National Police also said on Telegram. Police and local authorities said Russia had struck a civilian target.
Moscow has not yet responded to Ukraine’s claims it struck a civilian bus.
However, Russia’s state news agency TASS reported around the same time, citing a statement from the defense ministry, that Russian forces did strike a Ukrainian equipment staging site in the Sumy region with drones.
Russia and Ukraine have both accused each other of targeting civilians, which each denies.
An image shared by Ukraine’s national police showed a heavily damaged van bearing massive holes in the right and top side of the passenger seats. Its windows, as well as the windshield, were shattered.
Overall in Ukraine, Russian attacks killed at least 13 people and injured over 38 in the past 24 hours, which includes the attack in Sumy, Ukrainian authorities say. Two were killed in Donetsk region, and one person was killed in both Kharkiv and Kherson regions.
Friday’s talks marked the first face-to-face meeting between the two sides since the early weeks of the war.
But the meeting – which took place in Istanbul chaired by Turkey – was not attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had first proposed the talks but instead sent a junior delegation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also stayed away, having said he would not meet any other Russian official but Putin.
During the talks, Russia demanded that Ukraine must cede land still under Kyiv’s control, a source familiar with Friday’s negotiations told CNN, a position that Ukraine has long dismissed. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany and Poland called Russian demands in the talks “unacceptable.”
On Saturday, the Kremlin said that a meeting between Zelensky and Putin could happen, but only if certain conditions are met.
“Such a meeting is possible as a result of the work of the delegations of both sides in reaching certain agreements,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.
Peskov also spoke about preparing a list of “conditions” for a ceasefire agreement, that would then be exchanged with the Ukrainian side. Kyiv and its allies have repeatedly called for an unconditional truce and accuse Russia of deliberately holding up peace efforts.
US President Donald Trump said in a social media post that he will call Putin at 10 a.m. on Monday in an effort to clinch a ceasefire deal. Trump added that he would call Zelensky and various leaders of NATO countries afterward.
Trump told reporters earlier this week that he did not think peace talks would move forward unless he and the Russian president speak directly. “I don’t believe anything is going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,” Trump said.","['Chris Lau', 'Sophie Tanno']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/17/europe/russia-jails-australian-oscar-jenkins-ukraine-intl-hnk,Russia sentences Australian man to 13 years in prison for fighting for Ukraine,2025-05-16 00:00:00,"Russia has sentenced an Australian man to 13 years in a maximum-security prison for fighting alongside Ukrainian forces, state prosecutors in the Russian-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine said Friday.
Oscar Jenkins, 33, was found guilty by a court in Luhansk of participating in an armed conflict as a mercenary, prosecutors said in a statement, after it ruled he had fought for Ukraine against Russia between March and December last year.
Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Saturday that her government was “appalled” by the sentencing, calling it a “sham trial” and urged Russia to treat Jenkins in accordance with international humanitarian law.
Australia has repeatedly called for the release of Jenkins, who is originally from Melbourne, since he was captured by Russian forces in December.
“We continue to hold serious concerns for Mr Jenkins. We are working with Ukraine and other partners, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, to advocate for his welfare and release,” Wong said in a statement.
Russian prosecutors accused Jenkins of being paid between $7,400 and $10,000 a month to fight in Ukraine as a mercenary. The Kremlin maintains that mercenaries are subject to criminal prosecution and not entitled to prisoner-of-war protections under international law.
In a photo shared by the Russian-controlled court in Luhansk, Jenkins was seen standing in a glass cage with his hands behind his back.
The court ordered Jenkins to serve his sentence in a maximum-security penal colony, the prosecutor’s office said.
Jenkins is thought to have joined an international brigade among the Ukrainian ranks, according to Reuters. His arrest came to light late last year when a video surfaced on Russian Telegram accounts purportedly showing Jenkins being taken as a prisoner of war.
In the footage, which CNN has been unable to geolocate, Jenkins’ hands are tightly bound, and he appears to struggle to understand questions posed to him in Russian. A man strikes him twice across the head.
Speaking in a mix of English, Ukrainian and Russian, he identifies himself as “a soldier” and says he is a teacher in China and a student in Australia.
Earlier this year, media reports suggesting he might have been killed prompted Canberra to summon the Russian ambassador, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese vowing the “strongest action” over any harm caused to the man.
Albanese said last month his government would continue to make representations to the “reprehensible regime” of Russian President Vladimir Putin on behalf of Jenkins.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/europe/ukraine-russia-turkey-talks-ceasefire-hopes-dim-latam-intl,Ukraine ramps up calls for ‘pressure’ on Russia as talks end with no ceasefire,2025-05-16 00:00:00,"Russia and Ukraine’s first direct talks in three years began Friday with hopes as dim as the gray Istanbul skies.
And while the weather brightened as the talks went on, the prospects for peace did not.
In the end a large prisoner swap (one of many in this war) and two discussion topics for future talks – a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, and the contours of a ceasefire – were the only deliverables, as the press pack at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace thinned out and the sun sank over the Bosphorus.
The issue of a ceasefire is where the intractable differences are clearest.
Russia, by proposing these talks last weekend, had managed to sidestep an ultimatum from Ukraine and its allies to sign up to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face major new sanctions.
Ukraine, meanwhile, was “ready to have a ceasefire agreed today,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesman, Heorhii Tykhyi, told reporters in a hastily arranged briefing late Friday afternoon, suggesting this wasn’t achievable because Russia’s low-level delegation “probably has (a) limited mandate.”
Yet that is not the only obstacle. Russia’s delegation made clear Friday, a Turkish official told CNN, that an unconditional ceasefire was not on the table, and if Ukraine wanted the guns to fall silent it would have to withdraw from territory Russia does not yet occupy in the four regions (Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson) that Russia attempted to illegally annex in 2022.
Not a new demand, but one which is both unacceptable to Kyiv and led US Vice President JD Vance to state earlier this month that Russia was “asking for too much” in its requirements to end the war.
As the diplomatic cars slipped through Istanbul’s crowded streets, US frustration seemed to mount. After US officials met with both sides soon before their direct talks, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio left Istanbul with a scathing assessment of their prospects.
“We came because we were told that there might be a direct engagement between the Russians and the Ukrainians; that was originally the plan,” he told reporters.
“That was not to be the case, or, if it is, it’s not at the levels we had hoped it would be at.”
And so, the Ukrainian side moved quickly to control the narrative.
Barely had the delegations emerged in Istanbul before Zelensky, at a summit in Albania, convened a call with US President Donald Trump and key European allies.
“Ukraine is ready to take the fastest possible steps to bring real peace,” Zelensky wrote on social media after the call. But he also made it clear that it was not just Ukraine that must act, adding “if the Russians reject a full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings, tough sanctions must follow.”
Ukrainian officials in Istanbul took a similar tone.
“The tentative success of today’s negotiations is still to be consolidated,” First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters later in the afternoon. “That means that the pressure on the Russian Federation must continue.”
There was also a clear effort to emphasize the positives. “If we managed to agree on 1,000 for 1,000 exchange we think this was already worth it” said Tykhyi, the foreign ministry spokesman, referring to an agreed prisoner swap. “This is a great achievement by the Ukrainian delegation.”
Yet in a week where Russia has again rejected a ceasefire, ignored calls to send top-level officials to talks, and come to the table with demands that the US has already deemed unacceptable, there is still no sign of increased pressure from the US.
Instead, Trump promised Friday to meet with Putin “as soon as we can set it up,” having previously claimed “nothing’s going to happen (on Ukraine) until Putin and I get together.”
And so, the official Russian assessment from its chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, kept it simple. “We are satisfied with the outcome and ready to continue our contacts.”",['Clare Sebastian'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/europe/ukraine-russia-talks-npw-analysis-intl,Ukraine: A whiplash week of diplomacy leaves Kyiv much where it started,2025-05-16 00:00:00,"Much has happened this week, but what failed to transpire is the more telling.
The first direct talks between Ukraine and Russia should have heralded a new era of diplomacy towards solving Europe’s largest conflict since World War II. Instead, their context, brevity and limited outcome provided skeptics with more reasons to doubt Moscow wants peace.
The three conclusions – a prisoner swap, further talks about their presidents meeting, and both sides composing their vision of a future ceasefire – sound like progress.
But prisoner swaps occur regularly, Ukraine has already said it wants an immediate and unconditional ceasefire on air sea and land, and had already offered direct talks, between President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Russia rejected those two ideas, but Friday said it would again consider them.
Diplomacy has travelled a long distance this week to essentially return to zero – back where it started on Saturday. Then, in Kyiv, Ukraine, France, Germany, the UK and Poland demanded an unconditional ceasefire for a month, and published a picture of the five countries’ leaders on the phone to President Trump. They trumpeted his backing for the truce, but also what France called “massive sanctions” if Russia rejected the demand.
Six days later, on Friday, they again posted a picture of the same five men, huddled again around a telephone, this time in the Albanian capital Tirana, talking to POTUS. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was “unacceptable” Russia continues to ignore a truce. The UK’s PM Keir Starmer said Putin “must pay the price for avoiding peace.”
The symmetry of the demands and the images was remarkable. In the past week, Trump has performed stunning diplo-gymnastics. Putin shrugged off the demands for a truce and suggested direct talks in Istanbul. Zelensky said he would meet Putin there, and Trump offered to be an intermediary. Putin rejected all bar a junior meeting. And then Trump deflated any sense of urgency by adding he never expected Putin to attend without his also being in Istanbul, apparently concluding that “nothing is gonna happen” on Ukraine before he meets the Kremlin head.
We do not know how European leaders handled the Friday call, a concerned Macron pictured at its center, but they surely had to remind Trump of promises made. Trump has shown reluctance to pressure or speak ill of Putin in public. Yet now his credibility with his closest European allies – “smart cookie” Macron, and “tough negotiator” Starmer, who offered him a second state visit – is on the line. It is unclear whether this will stir him.
We have now gone full circle, in just a week, through the contradictory emotions that beset the White House on this thorny foreign policy issue on which the US administration has over-promised to deliver.
Two constants have emerged. Putin cares little for European or American pressure, simply proposing a minimalist peace offering, with maximalist demands, and refusing to budge. Trump seems to privately offers support to Ukraine and its allies, but publicly is seen extending the olive branch of a bilateral meeting with the Kremlin head, whenever Moscow is ready.
Intermittently, this White House has been keen to telegraph that their patience with Putin is limited, even expiring. Occasionally, even Trump hints at this, vaguely touting secondary sanctions as a throwaway remark earlier this week. Yet this impatience has yet to translate into the firm action Europe wants to see.
The White House benefits from the Kremlin’s deft baby-steps, insincere, inching towards peace. Russia does enough to permit Trump to pretend they are serious, while yielding no ground at all – even complicating matters Friday with a reported demand that Ukraine hand over territory Russia hasn’t conquered. There are enough vague, intractable whispers of diplomacy and further talks about talks, to provide the tantalising promise of a deal, without striking, or even delineating one. Russia is playing for time, evidently, and amassing forces on the eastern frontline, drone images show, ahead of a likely summer offensive.
Yet sometimes moments of clarity emerge. This week has perhaps helped elucidate where Moscow truly stands, but also too Trump’s reluctance to cause Putin pain. Clarity can be uncomfortable, and on Friday a stark assessment of Trump’s policy came from his former Ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, who resigned last month.
In an op-ed, Brink explained why:
“Unfortunately, the policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia…. As such, I could no longer in good faith carry out the administration’s policy and felt it was my duty to step down. ….Peace at any price is not peace at all ― it is appeasement. And history has taught us time and again that appeasement does not lead to safety, security or prosperity. It leads to more war and suffering.”
It may be too early to determine whether Trump’s soft-gloves approach spells appeasement. But the US president has deflated a week of mounting tension and pressure on Moscow by suggesting no progress can be expected until he meets Putin.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/europe/analysis-russia-ukraine-peace-process-intl-latam,The Russia-Ukraine peace process is going exactly how Moscow wants it to: slowly,2025-05-15 19:13:43,"In the end, it is the Kremlin’s plan playing out, and there appears to be little the White House will do about it.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s decision to send defense minister Rustem Umerov to meet with a low-level Russian delegation in Istanbul was a difficult choice forced by necessity. Its audience is one man: US President Donald Trump.
Kyiv must show it is willing to take any step at all to foster any kind of peace, or else it risks Trump slowly finding the pro-Kremlin voices around him rising in volume, getting bored of the processes entirely, and/or limiting aid to Ukraine.
But ultimately, the peace process is going exactly how Russia wants it to. Slowly, and with the Kremlin as its scheduler.
In the past week, since France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland stood with Ukraine and demanded a 30-day unconditional ceasefire to start on Monday, we have learned a lot about Putin and Trump’s real emotions here.
Firstly, the main revelation is the Kremlin is unafraid of further sanctions, of European pressure, and not cajoled by Trump. For now, Russian President Vladimir Putin sees the potential domestic pitfalls of a photo opportunity alongside the US president and his Ukrainian enemy to be far greater than the possible damage incurring Trump’s wrath may cause.
His rejection of this initiative is a calculated risk that may already be paying off. Trump’s reaction – to suggest “nothing is gonna happen” until he and Putin meet – throws all expectations for diplomacy to the wind until the pair have a bilateral summit. It permits Putin to pursue any course at liberty, aware the White House head does really believe there can be progress until the two presidents meet in person.
It is not impossible a bilateral meeting could happen soon, or even that the talks in Istanbul on Friday could spawn a leadership summit at the weekend. But Putin is likely relishing seeing the peace process inch forwards with just enough faux sincerity that the White House won’t drop it. Why rush? His forces are amassing near the eastern frontline, clearly with a larger Russian strategic objective in mind.
Putin’s decision to reject the overtures of Trump to attend reveal two key parts of his thinking. He was willing to endure the further “massive sanctions” France threatened for rejecting the ceasefire – and then the Istanbul summit too. And he likely also foresaw and gambled on, correctly, Trump’s limited anger. The Kremlin head was even willing to risk three days of speculation – and with it reject cajoling from Trump – as to whether he would attend, by keeping the world waiting for the composition of the Russian Istanbul delegation.
Putin may have been negotiating a bilateral with Trump as part of Turkey talks, or explicit conditions or concessions ahead of a presidential summit, or may have had absolutely no intention of accepting Zelensky’s offer. We may never know.
Zelensky now faces an awkward moment during which he must hover around the talks in case they suddenly escalate, yet not be seen be waiting Putin’s next move. A convenient summit – pre-planned, he said – awaits in Albania for Friday, but then he must urgently return to the war.
It is slowly becoming apparent that Trump may continue to shy away from the extra sanctions and consequences for Russia that Europe and his White House have hinted at. The limited and “technical” nature of the Russian team in Istanbul will provide just enough reason for Trump to hold out hope of progress, and delay adding pain to Moscow. The talks will likely sputter ahead, see the Kremlin present a series of maximalist demands, and Ukraine angrily demand a ceasefire that Russia continually rejects.
Even with the addition of Trump’s senior officials to the mix on Friday, there will likely be minimal progress and talks about further talks. And that is exactly how the Kremlin wants it.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/world/peace-talks-russia-ukraine-confusion,Confusion and chaos as Russia and Ukraine agree to first direct talks in 3 years,2025-05-15 21:07:52,"After five days of confusion over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for direct talks with Ukraine, the day they were supposed to begin initially brought only more of the same: a seven-hour stakeout on the banks of the Bosphorus, an unruly scrum at the Russian consulate, and finally a decision from Ukraine’s president that may open a new chapter in this intractable conflict.
The chaotic scenes that unfolded in Istanbul on Thursday set the tone for a difficult road ahead. As the world’s media descended in the morning on the Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul, Ukraine still hadn’t confirmed it would take part or given any signals as to the makeup of its delegation, and a source from the Turkish foreign ministry told CNN there was “no scheduled meeting yet.”
Instead, with the Kremlin confirming to CNN that Putin definitely would not show up, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, Ankara.
“Waiting is better than knowing the result,” joked Stanislav Ivashchenko, a correspondent with the Russian defense ministry channel Zvezda, waiting among the coffee-fueled crowds of journalists. “Everyone is tired of this,” he told CNN, referring to the war in Ukraine, “but, we will defend our position.”
Russia’s dogged defense of its position is a key reason the Russian president unexpectedly proposed these talks five days ago. Faced with an ultimatum from Kyiv and its allies to sign on to a 30-day ceasefire or face major new sanctions, Putin chose a third path.
“We are proposing to the Kyiv authorities to renew the negotiations, that they cut off” in 2022, he told journalists in a briefing early Sunday. And so, to reinforce that point, he picked the same city that hosted some of those early peace talks – Istanbul – and, he revealed late Wednesday, the same lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, a former culture minister and chairman of Russia’s Military-Historical Society.
“The delegation is committed to a constructive approach,” Medinsky said in a brief appearance Thursday afternoon at the Russian consulate, in which he took no questions. The media scrum was so intense that consular officials could be overheard threatening to cancel the briefing if journalists didn’t calm down.
Medinsky claimed the direct talks were to “establish long-term peace, eliminating the root causes of the conflict.” The use of the phrase “root causes,” which for Russia run the gamut from Ukraine’s NATO ambitions all the way to its existence as a sovereign state, was a reminder of just how distant a deal could be.
And yet, to complicate things further, Russia and Ukraine are now balancing their own interests with their relationship with Donald Trump. The US president once again Thursday dangled the prospect of his own attendance at the talks, saying “if something happened” he would consider going on Friday. White House envoys Keith Kellogg and Steve Witkoff are already slated to be in Istanbul on Friday.
And Zelensky made no attempt to hide Trump was a key part of his eventual decision to engage with Russia. Emerging from his meeting with Erdogan in late afternoon, he said he would not only send a delegation to Istanbul, but it would be led by a higher-ranking official than the Russian side – Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, “out of respect for President Trump.”
Russia is also watching closely for Trump’s next move, still holding out hope for that promised reset in relations. And Trump may have raised those hopes Thursday, telling reporters as he arrived in Abu Dhabi, “nothing’s gonna happen until Putin and I get together.”
Former Russian diplomat Boris Bondarev, who left his post in Geneva in 2022, said he believes a meeting with Trump would be a major win for Putin, while he remains uninterested in meeting with Zelensky.
“Two great powers should sit together and discuss how inferior countries should live under their umbrella,” he told CNN in an interview from Switzerland. “That’s how he sees the world. That’s why Zelensky doesn’t fit.”",['Clare Sebastian'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/europe/russia-ukraine-meeting-turkey-intl,"Russia and Ukraine are due to meet. But with Putin a no-show, confusion reigns. Here’s what we know",2025-05-14 00:00:00,"Days of speculation that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky could meet with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Turkey have ended with the Kremlin pouring cold water on the idea, confirming that the Russian leader had decided not to show up for talks he himself suggested.
The possibility of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was not entirely off the table as of Thursday morning, however, with lower-level delegations from both countries known to be in Turkey.
A direct meeting would be a major development – the two sides are not known to have met directly since soon after Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
And while the talks are unlikely to yield immediate results, and almost certainly won’t bring the elusive “deal” US President Donald Trump has been promising since his return to the White House, they could still have a major impact on the future of the war – if Trump decides that Putin’s no-show is a sign of his unwillingness to end the war.
Adding to the general uncertainty over how a day of high-stakes diplomacy might unfold, Zelensky is sitting down with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, Ankara, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in southern Turkey for an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers.
Here is what we know.
How did we get to this point?
The talks were first proposed by Putin in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Ukraine’s European allies on Saturday, when the leaders of Germany, France, Poland and the United Kingdom demanded that Russia accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal or face a new round of “massive” sanctions.
Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing instead “direct talks” between Russia and Ukraine.
This was likely a delaying tactic by Putin – something he has successfully deployed several times in the past. But it appears to have backfired.
The Europeans and Ukraine initially said there could be no talks before a ceasefire is agreed, but that quickly changed when Trump got involved. In a post on social media, he publicly urged Zelensky to “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”
Putin wasn’t suggesting a one-on-one with his loathed Ukrainian counterpart. He said he wanted a restart of the talks that took place in the spring of 2022 and were attended by top-level diplomats, but not the leaders themselves.
But Zelensky raised the stakes by announcing he would travel to Turkey himself and calling on Putin to do the same. The Ukrainian leader made it clear that he would not meet with any other Russian official, arguing that “everything in Russia depends on Putin.”
Trump, currently on a Middle East tour, added to the pressure by suggesting he might go as well, “if it’s helpful.” That idea was endorsed by Zelensky, who said Ukraine would be “grateful” for Trump’s presence. Trump also told CNN on Wednesday that Putin would “like me to be there.”
But two White House officials told CNN that Trump was not planning to travel to Turkey. “I was thinking about going,” Trump said Thursday in Qatar, but stressed it wasn’t a firm plan. He kept the option open, though, adding: “If something happened, I’d go on Friday if it was appropriate.”
By putting the ball in Putin’s court, Zelensky placed the Russian leader under pressure.
If Putin had decided to show up, he would have undermined his own narrative that Zelensky and his government are illegitimate.
But by staying at home, Putin gave Zelensky an opportunity to point out, once again, that Russia is not serious about peace.
This message is aimed squarely at Trump. Kyiv and its European allies have long said they don’t believe Putin is seriously interested in negotiating peace.
Trump has previously repeatedly expressed his belief in the opposite, although he began expressing his doubts in recent weeks, questioning whether Putin wants peace after speaking to Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral in the Vatican last month.
Highlighting this is likely the key reason why Zelensky suggested a personal meeting with Putin, who, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence services, had previously ordered his assassination.
What could be on the table?
The two sides are so far apart that it is unclear what the talks – if they indeed happen – would be about.
Zelensky said on Tuesday that anything other than an agreement on an unconditional ceasefire would be a failure.
Putin, meanwhile, said that while Russia does not rule out that “during these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,” the talks will aim to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict.
The “root causes” he cites include long-held Russian grievances that include the existence of Ukraine – formerly part of the Soviet Union – as a sovereign state, and NATO’s eastward expansion since the end of the Cold War.
Neither is negotiable for Ukraine or its allies.
What happened the last time Ukraine and Russia talked?
The last known direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place in Turkey and Belarus in the spring of 2022 – when it became clear that Putin’s initial plan to take over the whole of Ukraine and install a new puppet government in Kyiv within a few days had gone catastrophically wrong.
This left Russia scrambling, trying to achieve its goals through negotiations.
The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said the agreement that was proposed by Moscow called for Ukraine to surrender its sovereignty and would have made Ukraine completely powerless in the face of any future attacks.
Once Ukrainian forces began liberating parts of northern Ukraine, finding clear evidence of massacres and other atrocities as they advanced, the talks started to collapse.
The Russian abuses uncovered in one town in particular – Bucha, just north of Kyiv – horrified the world and hardened the resolve of the Ukrainian people.
If not Putin, who is coming?
Shortly after Zelensky challenged the Russian leader to travel to Turkey, the Kremlin started to lay the groundwork for the possibility that Putin might not attend.
The Kremlin late Wednesday said Vladimir Medinsky, Putin’s senior aide and member of the country’s Supreme Council bureau, would lead a delegation of Kremlin insiders. The aide previously headed Russia’s delegation in 2022 when Kyiv and Moscow had their last known direct talks.
This is in line with Putin’s call for the talks to pick up where the meeting in 2022 stopped – an option that would be unpalatable to the Ukrainians since the demands Russia was making back then would amount to a capitulation by Kyiv.
The stakes are higher this time though, as both Trump and Ukraine’s European allies have said they will impose more sanctions on Moscow if it doesn’t agree to the ceasefire.
It’s not yet clear whether Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul to meet with the Russian negotiators and who might be part of it.
What else do we know about the talks?
Not much. The Turkish government said earlier this week that it was prepared to provide “all kinds of support, including mediation and hosting negotiations, to achieve peace” in Ukraine.
Turkey has played the role of the bridge between Moscow and Kyiv in the past, most notably when it brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative which guarantees the safe passage of Ukrainian ships carrying food exports – a rare diplomatic success in the brutal conflict. Russia withdrew from the pact in 2023.
As a NATO member, Turkey is invested in the conflict, but it is also seen as more amenable to Russia, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan previously hailing his “special relationship” with Putin.
Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and his foreign envoy Steve Witkoff both plan to be in Istanbul this week, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday, a statement confirmed by another source familiar with the plans.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also in Turkey, attending the informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Antalya.
Rubio, Kellogg and Witkoff all took part in some of the previous rounds of talks in Saudi Arabia, in which they acted as intermediaries, meeting separately with the Russian delegation and then, a few days later, with the Ukrainians.
This time, the possibility that the two delegations might meet face to face is significant – even if their goal is more about satisfying Trump than reaching an actual deal.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/politics/trump-turkey-ukraine-russia-putin,"White House officials say Trump won’t attend Ukraine-Russia talks, ending speculation sparked by president’s remarks",2025-05-14 16:08:05,"No, President Donald Trump is not going to Turkey to personally mediate Ukraine-Russia peace talks.
For days, Trump repeatedly stirred speculation that he might upend his Middle East travel schedule – one his team meticulously crafted for weeks — to join the Russians and Ukrainians at the negotiating table. He told reporters on Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would “like me to be there.”
But shortly after the Kremlin released a list of their delegation attending the talks – signaling for the first time Putin would not be on hand – two White House officials told CNN that Trump would also not be attending.
Whether it was an effort to save face – or simply accepting the reality that Trump’s participation was always a lofty goal – the timing of both announcements signaled another chapter in the Trump-Putin relationship.
Changing Trump’s travel schedule at this point in his three-country trip to the Middle East would have been a logistical nightmare, officials said, never mind a major diplomatic challenge to prepare the president for such high-stakes talks in such short order.
Yet that didn’t stop Trump from continuing to drop hints that he might attend.
The former reality TV star seemed to be purposely injecting a “will he or won’t he” dynamic, one that kept his supporters and even some of his closest aides and allies guessing.
Putin would “like me to be there, and that’s a possibility. That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it to save a lot of lives and come back,” Trump said in response to a question from CNN’s Kaitlan Collins aboard Air Force One Wednesday.
He continued, “I don’t know that he would be there if I’m not there.”
Yet even as Trump toyed with going, Putin had not yet agreed to attend the talks despite proposing it himself. And Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wouldn’t hold talks with any Russian representative other than Putin himself.
Asked about Putin’s strategy and whether he still feels that the Russian leader is “tapping him along,” as he suggested in a previous post to social media, Trump told reporters he would let them know in a few days.
Trump first said on Monday that he was considering flying in to Turkey for the peace talks: “There’s a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen.”
Trump is currently scheduled to be in Doha, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Thursday, before flying back to Washington on Friday, as the diminished peace talks get underway in Turkey.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/europe/trump-russia-ukraine-talks-turkey-intl-hnk,Zelensky insists he will only join Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey this week if Putin is present,2025-05-13 03:53:01,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the stakes ahead of a potential meeting with Vladimir Putin in Turkey by saying he wouldn’t hold talks with any Russian representative other than the president himself.
Zelensky said he would travel to Turkey after US President Donald Trump urged him to meet Putin. The Russian leader had suggested direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in the country on Thursday in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Kyiv’s European allies on Saturday.
Asked by CNN about the goals of the possible meeting – one Putin has not yet agreed to attend despite proposing it himself – Zelensky said anything other than a ceasefire agreement would be a failure.
Aboard Air Force One en route to Qatar Wednesday, Trump suggested he could travel to Turkey for the talks, and that Putin wanted him to attend.
“He’d like me to be there, and that’s a possibility,” Trump told CNN. “I don’t know that he would be there if I’m not there.”
Despite Putin being the first to propose “direct talks” in Turkey, the Kremlin has since prevaricated over whether he will attend. Asked by reporters Wednesday about the make-up of Russia’s delegation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow will only reveal who it is sending to Turkey once Putin gives the order to do so.
Zelensky said he would not consider meeting any other Russian representatives because “everything in Russia depends” on Putin.
“So I said that on (Thursday) I will go to Turkey and I’m ready to meet Putin and an end to the war was through direct talks with him,” Zelensky told reporters at a news conference.
Russia hopes to deal directly with Ukraine in Istanbul, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian state news agency TASS on Tuesday.
“Our representatives are getting ready for this meeting,” the news agency quoted him as saying.
Although it is not clear whether the US or Russian presidents will show up in Istanbul, Trump has confirmed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will attend the talks.
The uncertainty over Thursday’s talks comes amid growing international pressure on Moscow to agree to the US-backed plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron warned Tuesday that if Russia doesn’t comply with those demands, sanctions – including on financial services – could be imposed “in the coming days in close liaison with the United States.”
Going some way to make good on this threat, the European Union on Wednesday unveiled a fresh round of sanctions against Moscow’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers, used by the Kremlin to circumvent previous Western sanctions against Russian oil exports.
Further sanctions could be imposed by France and Ukraine’s other major European allies if Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire at the planned talks in Turkey.
Two European diplomatic sources told CNN they have low expectations for Thursday and doubt Putin will actually show up.
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitor, said on Monday that Russian officials already appeared to be setting conditions for Putin to reject the meeting, quoting several key aides as questioning Zelensky’s intentions and calling the proposed meeting “pure spectacle.”
Zelensky also said he offered Trump the option of joining the meeting, saying the presence of the US president would “give additional impulse for Putin to fly in.”
He said earlier that his country “would appreciate” Trump’s attendance, and said he supported the US president’s call for direct talks between himself and Putin.
Top Trump administration officials plan to be in Turkey this week, but the president’s possible attendance remains an open question that will largely be dictated by whether his Russian counterpart attends, according to a senior administration official.
He is visiting the Gulf this week, making stops in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, for his first major overseas trip since the start of his second term. He said he could detour to Turkey “if I thought it would be helpful.”
“I think you may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. “I don’t know where I’m going to be on Thursday, I’ve got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there. There’s a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen.”
Whether Trump attends or not, US envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg and Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff both plan to be in Istanbul for the talks, the senior administration official said. Another source familiar with the plans also confirmed Witkoff’s attendance. As of Tuesday, the plan was for the US officials to observe the Turkish-facilitated talks between the Ukrainians and Russians.
Front line largely static
For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russia’s agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.
Ukraine’s major European allies had given Russia an ultimatum on Saturday: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine or face “massive” new sanctions.
Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing the talks instead. Direct talks between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine have not happened since the early weeks of Moscow’s unprovoked full-scale invasion in 2022.
Speaking on Tuesday, Zelensky said he expects the US and Europe to impose new “strong” sanctions on Russia if Moscow doesn’t sign up to the ceasefire on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine doesn’t seem to suggest Russia is preparing for a ceasefire. Russian troops have been inching forward in several key areas along the front line and launching near-daily drone and missile attacks against Ukrainian cities. Still, the front line in eastern Ukraine has not moved dramatically in recent months, with neither side able to break through.
The ISW said on Monday that Russia has reportedly deployed a largely ceremonial regiment of the Federal Security Service (FSB) to the front line, which the ISW said was “likely in an effort to generate fear of more rapid future Russian advances.”","['Jessie Yeung', 'Ivana Kottasová', 'Nick Paton Walsh', 'Andrew Carey']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/europe/mariupol-russian-occupation-social-media-influencers-intl-invs,"Mariupol: Content creators paint a rosy picture of life in the Russian-occupied city, with support from the Kremlin",2023-02-22 00:00:00,"Three years after it seized control of Mariupol following a brutal 86-day siege, Russia is using a more subtle power to keep its grip on the Ukrainian port city: social media influencers.
A CNN investigation found that residents of the occupied city, including schoolchildren, are being trained in new media programs and “blogger schools” with ties to the Russian state.
Though their follower counts and overall reach pale in comparison to celebrity influencers, experts say that the Kremlin needs local voices to effectively promote life under Russia’s rule.
“Just look what Russia is getting up to in Mariupol,” Pavel Karbovsky, a teacher at one of the blogger schools, said in a recent TikTok video highlighting the construction of new apartment buildings. “Wait, they’re building, not demolishing… this is Mariupol, our Russian town!”
Karbovsky is among a growing number of content creators painting a picture of renewal in cities and towns across the four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022 – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. He said he is not operating as a propagandist. Instead, his mission is “to show the truth” about life in Russian-occupied areas, he told CNN in a video interview from Donetsk.
But Russian-backed occupation officials have been actively encouraging creators like Karbovksy to post about the restoration of the “liberated” territories, including in official meetings.
In January, Karbovsky was among a group of content creators invited to meet with Denis Pushilin, the Russian-backed head of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Pushilin said in a statement on Telegram that he was “counting” on the group to spread the word that the eastern Donbas region was “being revived.”
“We are all united by an immense desire to restore and revive Donbas. And people should know as much information as possible about the large-scale work that is already underway,” the post continued.
CNN analyzed over a dozen profiles of local influencers promoting Moscow’s Russification project in Mariupol on social media platforms, some of which are openly pro-Russia and blame Ukraine for the pain inflicted on the region, while others appear apolitical. Despite their modest audiences – ranging from 3,000 to 36,000 on TikTok – their reconstruction-focused content can garner hundreds of thousands of views.
But absent from their videos is any context on the reason for rebuilding.
Russia’s siege of the port city, once known as a hub for trade and manufacturing, was one of the deadliest and most destructive battles since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.
According to United Nations estimates, 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in Mariupol during Russian attacks, and around 350,000 people out of the pre-war population of about 430,000 were forced to flee. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a recent interview that 20,000 civilians are believed to have been killed, though the death toll is impossible to verify. Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of trying to cover up evidence of civilian casualties, a claim the Kremlin denies.
“Moscow seeks to interrupt the flow of information about the terrible destruction brought by the Russian army,” Ihor Solovey, director of the Ukrainian government’s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, said in written comments to CNN. To counter this, he said, Ukraine is trying to “convey even more facts about the crimes of the occupiers,” adding that “there are more than enough of them to completely refute any Russian fakes about the ‘beautiful life’ under occupation.”
For Moscow, maintaining control of Mariupol remains a strategic priority and a focus of significant investment. “We are paying a lot of attention to Mariupol,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference in December. In March 2023, he staged a highly choreographed trip to the city, discussing “restoration” efforts with local officials. In a video that circulated online of him meeting residents, a voice off-camera could be heard shouting: “It’s all lies, it’s just for show.”
While construction is clearly ongoing, CNN’s analysis of satellite imagery, interviews with residents and videos posted to social media show significant destruction remains. Many who lost their homes in 2022 have not been rehoused and the quality of new housing is often inadequate. Residents say Russian authorities are also seizing homes from Ukrainians who fled the city to give to others.
“They have created a kind of Potemkin picture… But people don’t live there, in many houses, they don’t live there,” one Mariupol resident said, referencing the fake villages built by Grigory Potemkin in 18th-century Russia to impress Catherine the Great. He spoke to CNN anonymously for fear of reprisals.
CNN has reached out to the Russian-backed mayor of Mariupol and the Russian government for comment on the claims.
Training new voices
In September, an organization called the Donbass Media Centre (DMC) opened its “blogger school” in Mariupol. It offers free two-week courses designed to give aspiring influencers a technical grounding in skills like filming and editing, as well as an understanding of how to gain popularity and make money online.
Similar courses had already been held in Donetsk and Luhansk, and another followed in Melitopol, in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia. Karbovsky was one of the teachers.
“I know how to gather views, make content so I was invited to teach kids between 16 and 22,” he told CNN. Neither Karbovsky, nor the school’s coordinator would tell CNN who finances the program, but it appears to have the tacit support of the Russian government.
The DMC was set up by Donbass Media, a pro-Russian news channel mostly operating on social media. In 2024, the DMC won a Runet Prize, a national award of the Russian Federation and Presidential Foundation for Cultural Initiatives that celebrates excellence on the Russian internet. It also has a partnership with “Top Blog,” a competition for content creators run by a Kremlin program called “Russia - Land of Opportunities.” Last year, the most successful DMC students won a trip to Moscow to visit the headquarters of Vkontakte, Russia’s version of Facebook.
Vkontakte is among several Russian social media networks owned by state-run Gazprom-Media. The Kremlin has clamped down its control of social media in recent years, through ownership, internet slowdowns, and, more recently, legislation requiring influencers with over 10,000 followers to register their personal details with Russia’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor.
Karbovsky said the DMC’s aims are not political. “DMC does not have any such goal to create some sort of propagandists – no way. We don’t need this,” he said. “We want people to be able to share their different views about what is happening in the DPR (Donetsk People’s Republic) and the LPR (Luhansk People’s Republic) and other regions.”
The same month the DMC opened its “blogger school” in Mariupol, graduates of a Russian government program called “The New Media Workshop” opened a media center in Mariupol to teach schoolchildren 14- to 17-years-old photography, filming and how “to work in the social networks.” The free program is funded in part by a Russian presidential grant worth around $12,000. Participants are encouraged to show the positive side of Mariupol.
“We look forward to welcoming talented kids, so together we can talk about the life of our beloved city,” reads an October Telegram post from the media center. In another, a participant in the course interviews children about how Mariupol has changed. “It’s become much more interesting, more colorful,” says one young girl. “It’s developing quickly,” her friend adds.
In March, Rutube – an alternative to YouTube owned by Russia’s Gazprom-Media – announced it was setting up “studios” in cities and towns across the four annexed regions, including in Mariupol, where content creators could access high-tech equipment and training programs. The initiative is part of a joint project with the Russian Military Historical Society, which Putin created by presidential decree in 2012 to “counter attempts to distort” Russia’s military history.
“The world now really needs the truth about the lives of the new Russian citizens who have gone through a lot… but chose to speak Russian, think and dream in Russian,” one of the organizers said in a press release.
Andrei Soldatov, an expert in Russia’s intelligence services and state surveillance on the internet, says there’s no doubt who is directing these efforts. “It’s top level, it’s not regional, it’s not decided on the level of say the administrations of the occupied territories. It’s all about the Kremlin,” he told CNN.
Subtle messaging
Most of the social media accounts CNN analyzed started posting after Russia’s invasion and share content with a common theme: portraying Russian revival efforts in Mariupol in a positive light.
“When I heard people say Mariupol was a bad city, that nothing’s left of it, I wanted to show that the city is alive, is recovering, and that’s why I started showing what is really happening here,” Elizaveta Chervyakova, a 21-year-old DMC graduate from Mariupol, told CNN in a video interview from the city.
One of her most popular recent videos, with over 177,000 views, is a montage of both damaged and rebuilt buildings in the city set to a voice-over that states: “Mariupol – the seaside capital of Southern Russia.”
She told CNN that posting about the region’s recovery is becoming a trend.
“Look how beautiful,” another content creator, known as “Masha from Mariupol,” says in a TikTok video showing off newly built apartment blocks at sunset. “These apartments are filled with happy people… a wonderful region for family life.”
In other clips, she poses in front of a war memorial, gives a tour of the reopened railway station and shows off construction at the Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians were killed in a Russian airstrike.
“This is to those who think Mariupol is Ukrainian. Remember it is forever Russian,” reads the caption of one post. Masha, well-known in pro-Russian circles but not unaffiliated with the “blogger schools,” declined CNN’s request for an interview.
Posts like hers, about the rebuilding and Russification of the occupied territories, were the most liked and watched videos on accounts that CNN reviewed.
“They are clearly very grassroots,” said Darren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University and expert in social media disinformation, who reviewed the same accounts for CNN. He noted that while many use the same talking points, “we don’t see them directly engaging with Russian state sources.”
“They are approachable,” he added.
And that is part of the Kremlin’s strategy, experts say. Soldatov told CNN that local influencers are key to Russia’s attempts to win hearts and minds in occupied Ukraine, where audiences are less susceptible to mainstream propaganda.
“You cannot use automatically the voices which are familiar for the Russians who live in central Russia or Siberia or Moscow, you need to find local voices who understand how to talk to people who live in these territories,” he said.
A ‘Potemkin’ village
Satellite imagery reviewed by CNN between April 2022 and March 2025 show Moscow has been piling resources into rebuilding and Russifying parts of the city, constructing a new naval academy affiliated with one in St. Petersburg, a large memorial to commemorate the “liberators of the Donbas” and entirely new neighborhoods.
Shiny rooftops of restored, or in some cases newly built, apartment blocks are visible dotted in and around the city center, having mostly replaced buildings destroyed in the war, satellite images from late 2024 show.
But in other areas the scars of the conflict are still visible.
In a satellite image from December last year, a crane can be seen next to the Drama Theater, where the Russian word for children, ДЕТИ, was scrawled in the spring of 2022 – a failed attempt to deter Russian bombs. Russian state media has reported that the theater will be finished this year.
In December, Putin claimed in a press conference that at least 300,000 people had returned to Mariupol and said, “the population continues to grow at a rapid pace.” In March, he signed a decree ordering all residents of the four regions to get a Russian passport by September 10 or leave.
Mariupol’s Ukrainian exiled mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told CNN that only around 100,000 Ukrainians are estimated to remain in the city – including some who left during the siege and have since returned.
Boichenko said he believes Russians are being lured there not only through positive news stories and social media posts, but also by Russia’s preferential 2% mortgage rate for its “new territories” – a significant draw in a country where market rates are currently as high as 29%.
Russia has promised to provide “compensatory housing” to everyone affected by the war, but in videos circulating mainly on Telegram, groups of Mariupol residents claim they still have not received their apartments and deliver direct appeals to Putin for homes.
In one video that surfaced in January, some hold up a sign that reads “БОМЖИ,” a Russian acronym meaning “homeless people.” One person says they are being offered apartments belonging to residents who left Mariupol. “We earned our apartments, we don’t want other peoples,” she says, urging the authorities to continue building. The Russian-installed mayor of Mariupol has said some residents will be given “abandoned” properties, effectively stripping those who left the ability to return.
CNN analyzed satellite imagery of the addresses mentioned in the video. At one location, less than a kilometer from the devastated Azovstal steel plant, a block of buildings was cleared, leaving only the remnants of foundations. But in nearby streets, rebuilding is underway.
Two Mariupol residents, a couple who left the city last November and spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity as they plan to return, said the prices of new apartments are often so high no Ukrainians can afford them and there are serious issues with quality.
The newly built Nevsky neighborhood that Putin visited in 2023, for example, is not connected to the sewage system, they said.
They added that the posts from content creators do not accurately portray reality in Mariupol. “It is targeted at people who do not live (in Mariupol) and do not know this entire situation,” the woman said.
And pro-Russia content creators can’t rewrite history, Boichenko added. “This propaganda, these made-up clips that they are doing now in Mariupol, will not help. Russia has committed a crime in Mariupol, and the people of Mariupol know it,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-direct-talks-intl-hnk,Zelensky challenges Putin’s offer to meet after Russia ignores ceasefire demand,2025-05-11 00:57:29,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is prepared to meet Vladimir Putin this week, shortly after US President Donald Trump urged him to “immediately” accept the Russian leader’s offer to hold peace talks in Turkey.
After meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, Ukraine’s major European allies gave Russia an ultimatum: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions. Trump supported the initiative, Germany’s new chancellor Friedrich Merz said.
In a late-night address, Putin did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Ignoring the ceasefire offer, he instead proposed holding “direct talks” with Ukraine in Turkey on Thursday – something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022.
Ukraine’s allies spent Sunday stressing that there could be no further talks before Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire. But Trump undermined the efforts to put pressure on Putin, saying that Ukraine should “immediately” agree to meet with Russian officials on Thursday.
“HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Within an hour, Zelensky said he was prepared to meet with Putin this week, in what would be the leaders’ first meeting since Russia launched its war.
“I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,” Zelensky said Sunday on X.
Although Zelensky said a “full and lasting ceasefire” from Monday would provide “the necessary basis for diplomacy,” he did not specify that this would be a precondition for attending the talks.
Whereas Putin on Saturday faced a joint call from Europe and the US to accept a ceasefire by Monday’s deadline, his counteroffer of “direct” talks had by Sunday relieved much of the pressure on Moscow and shifted the focus to the potential talks this week. European leaders have not yet said whether they will press ahead with the threatened additional sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire is not in place by Monday.
Before Trump’s comment, Zelensky had responded with trepidation to Putin’s offer, calling it a “positive sign,” but stressing that Kyiv first expects Moscow to agree to the new ceasefire proposal. Ukraine’s European allies more forcefully dismissed Putin’s offer, saying there could be no new talks before a ceasefire.
Merz, Germany’s new chancellor, said talks “cannot begin until weapons fall silent.” Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the world was still waiting on Russia’s “univocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.” French President Emmanuel Macron said Putin’s counter-offer was “not enough.”
Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s special envoy to Ukraine, whose influence has dwindled since January, echoed the Europeans’ claims, saying a ceasefire must come before talks, “not the other way round.”
But Trump abandoned his earlier demand that Russia agree to a 30-day ceasefire, instead calling on Ukraine to attend the peace talks without preconditions.
For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russia’s agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.
But Putin’s offer for direct talks – made in a rare televised address at 1 a.m. local time Sunday – was a gamble to distract from the fact that Russia is likely to snub Monday’s ceasefire deadline, analysts said.
Putin’s offer put Zelensky under “huge pressure” to agree to hold talks in Turkey, Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told CNN.
“Why? Because otherwise, he’ll have to deal with Trump, who’s going to say, ‘Why are you undermining my peace initiative here? Why can’t you just talk?’”
Turkey ‘ready’ to host talks
Already setting the stage for talks, Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday. The Kremlin said Erdogan “fully supported” Putin’s proposal for peace talks and had offered Istanbul as a venue.
On Monday, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan to discuss the start of direct negotiations, according to statements from both sides.
Although Ankara confirmed Turkey is ready to host the negotiations, a statement from the country’s presidency suggested that it agreed with Ukraine’s allies that a ceasefire must come before talks.
“Noting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdoğan said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks,” the statement read. It did not say whether Turkey would decline to host the talks if Russia refused the ceasefire offer.
The White House said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Turkey from Wednesday to Friday, to attend an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers and discuss “ending the Russia-Ukraine war,” meaning he will be in the country on the day of Putin’s proposed peace talks.
Trump’s dropping of his demand for Russia to agree to a ceasefire marks a dramatic change in approach. Last week, Trump had called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, without providing a deadline. “If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,” he warned. The European leaders in Kyiv added weight to the threat by naming Monday as a deadline.
Radchenko said that Putin’s late-night offer of peace talks was an attempt to shift the pressure on Russia back onto Ukraine.
“He knows that Trump wants direct talks,” Radchenko said. “Now, by saying, ‘Look, we’re offering talks and the Ukrainians are the ones who are not agreeing,’ he is putting the ball back in Kyiv’s court.”
As well as distracting from his snubbing the ceasefire proposal, the offer allowed Putin to pose “as the peacemaker, kindly inviting Ukraine to the table,” Radchenko said. “He’s seen as taking the initiative.”
In his address, Putin said Russia does not rule out that “during these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,” but stressed that the talks will aim to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict.
Around the same time as Putin’s late-night speech, a three-day pause in fighting ordered by Russia’s leader came to an end, with Ukraine reporting more than 100 drone attacks overnight. Both sides accused each other of continuing attacks during the truce, ordered by Putin to mark Russia’s World War II Victory Day.","['Christian Edwards', 'Mariya Knight', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Rosa Rahimi', 'Kit Maher']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/europe/europe-us-pressure-russia-trump-ukraine-intl-cmd,Europe and US briefly upped the pressure on Russia over Ukraine. Trump upended that,2025-05-12 12:08:33,"For about 30 hours, the illusion of transatlantic unity over Ukraine was maintained.
Europe and Ukraine had demanded a deal on the 30-day unconditional ceasefire the Trump administration proposed two months earlier. European leaders said US President Donald Trump had personally backed their plan – and threat of sanctions if Russia declined to sign up by Monday – in a Saturday phone call, a picture of which they posted online from Kyiv.
Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, even joined a chorus of US allies demanding Russia adhere to the ceasefire demand.
But then Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke, refusing to even mention the demand, and instead presenting something old as something new: direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, four days later. And transatlantic unity shattered. Trump leapt on the Kremlin proposal – simply stating on his Truth Social network that Putin didn’t want a ceasefire – and instead pressuring Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky to “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”
Again, the pendulum swung back. Trump had been conspicuously silent as the US’ longstanding allies trumpeted their newfound unity. Putin spoke, and Trump realigned.
Zelensky was left only able to show personal commitment and valor, and to offer to make the meeting a face-to-face with Putin, the man charged with war crimes against his nation. That is a tough move for him domestically.
It is important to not exclude the possibility that, behind the scenes, Moscow and Washington are hatching something bringing the world closer to peace. But as Trump spoke, European leaders seemed to, in turn, fall silent themselves. Ukraine’s skies did not.
On the night in which a ceasefire had been demanded, Russia launched 108 drones, carrying out strikes including one that trapped a 10-year-old girl under the rubble in Kherson region.
The significance of Saturday’s Kyiv declaration lay less in the immediate likelihood of an end to the fighting for a month. Europe’s leaders appeared intensely skeptical that their overture would garner Moscow’s approval. Instead, cynics might argue, the exercise was about proving to the White House that Putin was not interested in the peace, or indeed the specific ceasefire proposal, that the Trump administration sought.
But that was not the only “reveal” that Europe’s four largest military powers got for their complex and lengthy trip to the Ukrainian capital. Trump also improved their perspective on his real position too.
Putin is now thrice emboldened. He was able to completely ignore the European and Ukrainian demand – to not even mention it directly. Secondly, he has faced – as yet – none of the “massive sanctions” on Russia and boosted military aid to Ukraine that Europe appeared to suggest Trump backed, in the event there was no ceasefire.
Thirdly, his proposal for direct talks in Istanbul – nothing new there, bar the date of Thursday – suddenly became the bedrock of Trump’s position. The US president held out the possibility of consequences if those talks were fruitless. But yet another step was introduced in between Russia betraying its disinterest in peace, and Ukraine’s allies escalating their measures against Moscow.
The singular persistent theme in all the past few months of chaos is Trump’s reluctance to move in ways that damage his relationship with the Kremlin. We do not know if Trump and Putin spoke in between the Europeans’ visit to Kyiv and Trump posting on Truth Social. But perhaps we do not need to: Either way, when faced with a fork in the road between the unity his European allies seek, and a path in which Putin and he remain on better terms, Trump chose the latter.
The threat of sanctions – massive or not – was always a complex task. Russia is already heavily sanctioned, and there are limited moves still to be made of real consequence, without damaging the West significantly too. Key is whether Europe tries to inflict pain on Russia without American support. To do so would expose their disunity, but may be a better choice than their threats in Kyiv ringing hollow.
The meeting in Istanbul, if indeed it happens, is itself a hugely perilous step. Putin and Zelensky palpably despise each other. The former sees the latter as a pro-European traitor and а success symbol born of the imperial decline that Soviet-era bureaucrats have yet to accept. The latter sees the former as the man who invaded his country mercilessly without reason, and relentlessly bombs children, every night. It is more likely the men fail to find common ground than emerge, reconciled, with a path ahead.
It is not impossible that the White House, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Turkey on the proposed date, and Trump in the region, tries to facilitate. Yet Putin has yet to even agree to attend, despite proposing the direct talks, making any acceptance now appear like some sort of grand gesture of peace. The United States being too deeply involved could backfire on their relationships with just about everyone.
The simplest conclusion to be drawn from the past few days is that Trump fails to see that Putin is seeking to buy time. The Kremlin’s forces appear to be reinforcing, not reducing, along a front line where they’re pushing hard near Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. The weekend’s deadlines have come and gone, exposing the brief moment of unity as an aberration, and the White House as unwilling to anger Putin.
The possible meeting in Istanbul is only three days away. But it will not bring peace immediately, or perhaps even a ceasefire at all, just diplomatic pageantry and significant personal animosity between two men from entirely different generations in the post-Soviet world. It may even set the peace process back, and again delay the moment when Trump must decide whether he will join his European allies in causing pain to Russia for refusing a truce.
What the answer to Trump’s postponed, vital decision, will be is already clear. How Europe and Ukraine fend for themselves is not.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-call-intl-latam,Ukraine ceasefire call is aimed at forcing Putin to reveal his war goals to Trump,2025-05-10 17:03:09,"It was a proposal that the Kremlin could neither outright reject nor accept, intended to force it into an awkward choice, revealing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s true appetite for his brutal war of choice.
Europe’s leaders have grasped the nettle of whether peace talks over Ukraine can lead anywhere meaningful, to force Moscow into a pause in violence, precisely when it seems to seek to escalate assaults in the summer months ahead.
It also gave Europe’s largest army – Ukraine - the unenviable task of preparing in just over 30 hours their frontline forces for perhaps a month of tense peace, and then hopefully weeks of serious negotiation, in which the borders of their country will be decided.
Ultimately, Ukraine, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland faced little choice: the Trump administration’s very public loss of patience – sometimes with Moscow, but also less justifiably with Kyiv – carried the risk of the White House simply “moving on.” That could lead to the United States dropping aid to Ukraine, together with their efforts for a peaceful solution – a potential disaster for European security.
The past week’s clear enormous diplomatic lifting by French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and of course Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky himself, has put the White House in a position where it has had to back a direct European bid to take control of the outcome of the biggest war on the continent since the 1940s.
Europe is indeed forcing on Russia a proposal initially made by the US and Ukraine – the 30-day unconditional ceasefire first offered after a bilateral meeting in Saudi Arabia almost two months ago. But they are also forcing the White House to step up, monitor the truce, and then back tough consequences – Macron called them “massive sanctions” – if the initiative falls apart.
Putin’s answered by simply stating he did not believe Ukraine had honored the previous ceasefires Moscow had unilaterally called, and that Kyiv has said Moscow never respected either. And he suggested something old as something new: the idea of direct talks, already consented to in differing terms by both sides, concretely in Istanbul on Thursday. Macron and Zelensky were clear the offer was not enough and a ceasefire must precede talks.
The Kremlin was in a place where it needed to agree, dispute, or ignore the proposal. It chose to contrive, as it has in the past, a complex fudge of a response. Putin seemed to refuse to address the proposal directly and offered perhaps enough to suggest to Trump he is interested in peace, but not enough to suggest European pressure is working.
This is the most significant diplomatic moment of the war, perhaps the most important declaration of the conflict yet, and certainly the most important 36 hours since Putin faced a rebellion from his top aide Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023. Time is a serious problem: something that has to last 30 days must be built in 30 hours.
Gigantic questions remain for Ukraine and its allies as to how this ceasefire comes into effect. Can Kyiv order its forces to not fight back in self-defense? If the US is to monitor the truce, as Macron suggested, does it have the capabilities in place, in adequate quality and quantity, to study hundreds of miles of violent frontlines? Precise evidence of Moscow’s infractions will be key to helping Ukraine and Europe respond to the inevitable wave of Russian misinformation and recrimination that may accompany a truce.
The cost for Kyiv and Europe of the next month could be significant. Ukraine could lose ground as its troops soften their responses to Russian assaults during a ceasefire. The White House might emerge from the process and again swing back on its pendulum to a place where it believes Zelensky is the problem. Europe’s unity – on display remarkably today in Kyiv, and backed by over a dozen other countries from New Zealand to Canada – can only worsen from its current peak, especially if American support for Ukraine ebbs.
But the cost of doing nothing – as was the case in the Europe of the 1930s – was higher. Trump losing patience with perhaps the most complex item on his portfolio would likely be damaging for Kyiv, more than for Moscow. Putin having another two months to pick away at Kyiv’s frontlines would leave Zelensky facing another ghastly winter.
Ukraine and its European allies seek clarity from this proposal on whether Putin wants any kind of peace at all. The path they have chosen to get there is in itself unclear, and deeply fraught with potholes of Putin’s manipulation.
Listening to the heads of Europe’s five largest militaries in Kyiv Saturday, it appeared most had made their mind up that Putin does not want peace and won’t genuinely contemplate a month of it. These five leaders face a tricky few weeks of establishing that fact, and then the messy persuasion of Trump that he must take an even tougher position on Russia than his predecessor, Joe Biden.
The path ahead that Europe’s leaders appear to envisage is of a worsening of the war – where Putin violates a ceasefire, is hit with “massive sanctions,” and Europe must escalate its military backing for Ukraine. They do not appear to think the Kremlin wants the war to stop. The weeks ahead are designed, it seems, for a future in which they must prove to Trump he is being misled, and drag his White House permanently and irrefutably into their camp.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/europe/europe-countries-landmine-ban-russia-intl,Russia’s European neighbors are lifting bans on landmines. Campaigners are horrified,2025-05-11 04:00:50,"They are considered one of the world’s most dangerous, and indiscriminate, weapons. Yet five European countries have turned their backs on an international treaty on the use of landmines, citing the growing threat from Moscow.
Finland, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania – which all border Russia – have made moves to pull out of the Ottawa Treaty, the agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines, which are designed to kill or maim if stepped on.
The developments have alarmed campaigners, who see the reintroduction of the weapons – which have killed or disfigured tens of thousands of civilians around the world and can contaminate an area for decades after a conflict ends – as a concerning regression.
The treaty, which also bans the weapons’ production and stockpiling, was signed in 1997, and was one of a series of agreements negotiated after the Cold War to encourage global disarmament. Since then, it has been credited with significantly reducing the harm from landmines.
Responding to Finland’s decision to leave the agreement, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned that the Nordic nation was endangering civilian lives, describing it as a “disturbing step backwards.”
The decision “goes against decades of progress on eliminating the production, transfer and use of inherently indiscriminate weapons,” the NGO warned.
At the start of this year, the pact had 165 member states. But major powers, including Russia, China, India, Pakistan and the United States, never signed up to it.
In a joint statement in March, Poland and the three Baltic states announced their withdrawal, arguing for a rethink on which weapons are – and which ones are not – acceptable in the face of Russia’s aggression.
The countries said they needed to provide their armed forces with greater “flexibility and freedom of choice,” to help them bolster the defense of NATO’s eastern flank.
The following month, in April, Latvia became the first country to formally withdraw from the treaty after its parliament strongly backed the proposal, meaning that after a grace period of six months, Riga would be able to start amassing landmines again.
Also that month, Finland unveiled plans to join Latvia. Explaining the decision, Finland’s Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told journalists that Russia poses a long-term danger to the whole of Europe. “Withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention will give us the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way,” he said.
The announcements come as U.S. President Donald Trump has doubled down on efforts to wrap up the war in Ukraine, which has stoked fears in neighboring states that Moscow could re-arm and target them instead.
Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow of the Russia and Eurasia program at the thinktank Chatham House and author of the book “Who will Defend Europe?,” believes that if and when Russia’s grinding conflict in Ukraine does come to an end by whatever means, Moscow will be readying itself for its next target.
“Nobody is in any doubt that Russia is looking for further means of achieving its objective in Europe,” Giles told CNN.
For Giles, the military benefits of using landmines are clear. The underground explosives, he said, can slow an invasion, either by redirecting oncoming troops to areas that are easier to defend, or by holding them up as they attempt to breach the mined areas.
They can be particularly beneficial for countries looking to defend themselves against an army with greater manpower. “They are a highly effective tool for augmenting the defensive forces of a country that’s going to be outnumbered,” he said.
He believes the five countries leaving the treaty have looked at the effectiveness of the weapons, including their use in Russia’s war on Ukraine, in deterring invading forces.
However, he stressed that the Western countries wouldn’t use landmines in the same way as Moscow’s forces, saying there were “very different design philosophies” in the manufacturing of mines and cluster munitions between countries that aren’t concerned with civilian casualties or may willingly try to cause them, and those that are trying to avoid them.
In Ukraine, extensive Russian minefields laid along Ukraine’s southern front lines significantly slowed a summer counteroffensive launched by Ukraine in 2023.
Ukraine is deemed by the United Nations to be the most heavily mined country in the world. In its most recent projections, Ukraine’s government estimates that Moscow’s forces have littered 174,000 square kilometers (65,637 square miles) of Ukraine’s territory with landmines and explosive remnants.
This means Ukrainian civilians, particularly those who have returned to areas previously on the front lines of the fighting, are faced with an ever-present risk of death.
“The large-scale contamination of land by explosive ordnance has created an ‘invisible threat’ in people’s minds,” Humanity & Inclusion, an international charity helping those affected by poverty, conflict, and disaster, warned in a February report on the use of landmines in Ukraine. “As a result, people’s movements are extremely reduced or restricted, they can no longer cultivate their land and their social, economic, or professional activities are hindered.”
According to findings from Human Rights Watch published in 2023, Ukraine has also used antipersonnel landmines during the conflict and has received them from the US, despite Kyiv being a signatory of the 1997 ban.
In comparison, Finland, Poland and the Baltic nations say they would remain committed to their humanitarian principles when using the explosives, despite withdrawing from the ban.
When announcing its plans to leave the Ottawa Treaty, Helsinki stressed it would use the weapons in a humane manner, with the country’s president Alexander Stubb writing on X, “Finland is committed to its international obligations on the responsible use of mines.”
While the responsible use of landmines is a complex issue, measures to reduce civilian harm can include making precise records of minefields and their locations, educating communities to their dangers and the clearance or neutralization of the weapons once the conflict is over.
‘Disturbing step backwards’
Despite such pledges of responsibility, the move away from the Ottawa Treaty has left campaigners horrified.
Landmines have killed or maimed tens of thousands of civilians across the world and continue to cause harm. In its 2024 report, the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor found that at least 5,757 people were killed and wounded by mines and explosive remnants of war across the globe in 2023, with civilians making up 84% of that number.
Alma Taslidžan, from Bosnia, was displaced from her homeland during the war of the early 90s, only to return with her family to a country laced with landmines – a contamination issue she says plagues the country to this day.
Now working for disability charity Humanity & Inclusion, she described the five countries’ decision to pull out of the treaty as “absolute nonsense” and “the most horrible thing that could happen in the life of a treaty.”
She told CNN that the arguments for banning landmines have not changed since the Ottawa Treaty was formed in the 1990s. “Once it’s in the ground, it’s a danger. It cannot distinguish between the foot of a civilian and the foot of a child and the foot of a soldier.”
She continued, “We are surprised that such advanced militaries like the Finnish, like the Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, would consider putting this hugely indiscriminate weapon in their military strategy, and what is worse, putting it in their land.”
Yet, for some, the new, precarious security reality that Europe is facing means that previous red lines are now up for discussion.
This is the case for Giles, who sees the latest developments as a recognition from these countries that treaties on landmines were “an act of idealism which has proven to be over-optimistic by developments in the world since then.”",['Sophie Tanno'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/politics/ukrainians-us-concerns-trump,Ukrainians who fled war and the US communities that welcomed them fear they may be uprooted under Trump,2025-05-10 16:00:51,"Sasha had only heard a little about South Carolina, and even less about the town of Hartsville, when he and his family moved there in September 2022.
They were forced to suddenly leave behind their life in Kyiv because of the war with Russia. They are not the only Ukrainians in the “small, rural community” where they have been welcomed and begun to rebuild their lives.
“For me, the United States, it was like a fortress of democracy, of freedom, of opportunities, and I thought, finally, finally, I’m in the place where I can begin my life all over again,” Sasha, who is not using his last name for fear of reprisal, told CNN.
Sasha, his wife and his young daughter are among the approximately 280,000 Ukrainians who have relocated to the United States through “Uniting for Ukraine” (U4U), a US government humanitarian parole program that allowed private US citizens to sponsor and help support Ukrainian refugees.
Now, Sasha’s family and scores of others who came to the US under the U4U program fear their lives may once again be uprooted, as decisions on parole extensions, temporary protected status, and work authorizations have been paused amid the Trump administration’s sweeping changes to the immigration system.
“This really could be catastrophic, not just for the Ukrainian families, but for our community,” said Curtis Lee, Sasha’s sponsor and a member of “Carolinas for Ukraine.”
A spokesperson for the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said there is “an administrative hold on all pending USCIS Benefit Requests filed by Parolees Under the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) Process.”
“This is pending the completion of additional vetting to identify any fraud, public safety, or national security concerns,” they said in a statement to CNN. “USCIS is committed to safeguarding the integrity of our nation’s immigration system and carrying out President Trump and Secretary Noem’s mandate to make America safe again.”
‘This community feels absolutely devastated’
For Liana Avetisian and Alina Mirzoian, Ukrainian cousins who settled with their family in DeWitt, Iowa, that “administrative hold” could spell the end to their American dream. They paid thousands in application fees through the immigration system but have not yet received temporary protected status (TPS) and the administration suspended processing humanitarian parole extensions before theirs were granted, their sponsor Angela Boelens explained. The lack of action threatens to leave them in limbo.
Avetisian said she feels betrayed. Boelens, who is also the president of Iowa Newcomer Community & Exchange (IA NICE), said the community feels betrayed too.
“This community feels absolutely devastated. We don’t know what we’re going to do with all the home mortgages here in town, the people who are losing their valuable employees, their friends in school are crying. They had to hire a counselor at the school locally to help the children understand some of what’s going on,” she told CNN. Boelens explained that the community “had raised half a million dollars to buy transitional houses” for newcomers to stay in. Some have since been able to buy houses of their own.
“This entire community feels really hurt, and this is a very, very red community, they’re in disbelief,” she said. “So, they’ll never step up again and help people like they did, because they also feel like they’ve been betrayed.”
Sam Heer, who employs four Ukrainian workers including Avetisian and Mirzoian, told CNN “it would hurt” if they had to leave.
Heer said the community is committed to helping them with their bills. He applied for work visas for the four of them, but he doesn’t “have a good feel” for the status of those permits, he said.
“They’re great assets to our community, they’re hard working. They want to learn. They want to provide for their families,” he said.
‘It’s going to tear us apart’
The town of Hartsville is also bracing for the potential impact if their Ukrainian neighbors cannot stay.
“They have become such an integral part of our community,” Lee told CNN, noting at least one company that relies on skilled labor from resettled Ukrainians. “People just embraced it. And it’s going to tear us apart if that happens.”
Lee warned that the US government “doing nothing will actually force many of them to leave.”
“They should at least give them some certainty,” he said, “even if they just kicked the can down the road and gave them all a blanket parole and work authorization until after the midterms.”
Lee, who said he is a registered Republican, believes the U4U program aligns with the Trump administration’s priorities. Because of the sponsorship aspect, it has a relatively low cost for the US government. Boelens described the program as “the right kind of refugee program, handled perfectly.”
“The US is not on the hook for tickets,” Lee noted. “We are basically taking on the burden of resettlement,” he noted.
“Little towns like mine, we need to have people coming in, just from a pure population standpoint, and especially ones that are going to bring additional talent and diversity,” he said.
The Ukrainians who came to the US through U4U “followed the legal process.”
“They went through the background checks. They’ve done everything that they’re supposed to do. They follow the laws. They’re paying their taxes,” Lee said. “For all this talk of, well, you know, we’re going to get rid of the immigrants that supposedly aren’t good for the US – that’s not this group.”
Uncertainty and fear
For the Ukrainians who may be affected, the specter of uprooting their lives again has already been traumatizing.
“I feel really bad about the situation,” said Mirzoian, telling CNN she feels “nervous all the time.”
Avetisian who came with her husband as well as her now 14-year-old daughter, and Mirzoian came to DeWitt in May 2023 from near Kyiv. They had returned to Ukraine after relocating for two months to Bulgaria at the start of Russia’s war, but then in autumn 2022 found that life there was “harder and more dangerous” amid Moscow’s relentless attacks on critical infrastructure.
“No light, electricity, and it was cold, and we were sitting in our houses with candles,” she explained.
When they came to DeWitt, they were welcomed into the community, where a couple of other Ukrainian families had also settled.
“People here are all so good. They really helped us,” Avetisian told CNN. Now, if they are made to leave, they don’t feel that they can return to Ukraine.
“I don’t want to take my 14-year-old daughter and go to another country and start there and learn a new language and make new friends and look for a new house. It’s very hard,” she said.
Sasha said he feels like he’s back in the “worst period” of his life during the war, where he felt like he was not in control of his life.
His family fled Kyiv with just minutes to pack their suitcases after explosions near their home and separated for several months – his wife and daughter went to Italy while he remained helping build shelters in Ukraine. He heard about the U4U program through a friend, and the family quickly made the decision to apply so they could be together.
They were “a little bit confused and scared because we don’t know where we’re going, we didn’t know what to expect,” said Sasha.
Speaking over video chat with Lee and his wife, Barbara, who were their sponsors, helped assuage some of those fears, he said. Their concerns were further eased when they arrived.
Now, Sasha has restarted his construction business in Hartsville, building affordable tiny houses out of shipping containers.
“He’s invested a lot, not just in time and effort, but he has a rental contract for the place he’s using to build stuff, he’s purchased a lot of equipment,” Lee explained.
“I’m trying to not think about” possibly having to leave the US, Sasha said. He recalled that his daughter had just begun to talk when they relocated to the US after having to move several times.
“She had the same question all the time, ‘Daddy, where is our home?’ When you can’t answer this question, I can’t even explain how it feels,” he told CNN. “A couple months ago, she started to call this place where we live in, she started to call it home.”",['Jennifer Hansler'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/europe/european-leaders-kyiv-ukraine-visit-intl,"European leaders visit Kyiv, and tell Russia: 30-day ceasefire now or face massive sanctions",2025-05-10 08:34:37,"The leaders of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Poland have told Russian leader Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day ceasefire starting on Monday or face possible “massive” sanctions, according to French President Emmanuel Macron, on a highly symbolic visit to Kyiv. The demand comes with the backing of the White House after a joint phone call with President Donald Trump, the Europeans said.
Standing alongside Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, the four leaders - Macron, new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk – said the ceasefire should be observed on land, at sea and in the air.
If successful, Macron said, it could pave the way for “the immediate launch of negotiations to build a robust and lasting peace.”
In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen shortly after the leaders called for the ceasefire, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia is “resistant to any kind of pressure.”
“Europe is actually confronting us very openly,” Peskov said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin supports the idea of a ceasefire “in general,” but “there are lots of questions” about the recent proposal that still need answering. He did not expand on what these questions are.
The dramatic announcement gives Putin less than 36 hours to respond, and also means a complex mechanism of satellite monitoring and communications would need to become operational in the same, short time period.
“We have agreed that from Monday 12th of May, a full and unconditional ceasefire must start for at least 30 days,” Zelensky said. “We demand it together from Russia and we know that the United States supports us in this.
“The unconditional ceasefire means no conditions and an attempt to put conditions on it is to signal an intention to drag out the war and undermine diplomacy.”
The four European leaders arrived together by train early Saturday morning and were met at Kyiv’s main railway station by Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. Their first public engagement was at Independence Square, where they stood to honor Ukraine’s fallen soldiers. Then it was on to the city’s Mariinsky Palace, where they met together for more than three hours.
Afterwards, the leaders sat together round a phone and spoke to Trump. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha posted a photo of the moment on social media, saying the call had been “fruitful,” while Zelensky called it “positive and concrete.” There was no immediate response from the White House.
For two months now, Ukraine has said it wants an immediate 30-day ceasefire – a position promoted by Kyiv’s key European allies, and also by Trump.
Russia has so far refused to commit, saying it supports the idea of a 30-day ceasefire in principle but insists there are what it calls “nuances” that need addressing first.
In an interview with ABC News published earlier on Saturday, Peskov suggested that one of these “nuances” was putting a halt to the supply of US and European weapons to Ukraine.
Putin has often spoken about the need to address what he calls “root causes” – which are taken to mean, among others, the eastward expansion of NATO.
In a Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump wrote that “if the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,” adding to a sense he is growing frustrated with Russian stalling.
Peskov told CNN Saturday that Russia is “very grateful” for the US’ mediation efforts, but added that “at the same time, it’s quite useless to try to press on us.”
The inauguration of Trump in January ushered in a complete change in the US diplomatic focus on the war, with Ukraine and key allies fearful of a significant tilt in US policy towards Moscow.
European leaders have convened a series of meetings in response, aimed both at showing the US that Europe can do more to support Ukraine militarily, as well as providing a single voice urging the US president not to take Russia’s side in the war.
For its part, rather than commit to a lengthy ceasefire, the Kremlin has instead pursued a policy of unilateral short-term ceasefires - the latest of which began on Thursday and is due to end at midnight tonight.
It coincided with Russia’s May 9 Victory Day celebrations – when the country marks the defeat of Nazi Germany. This year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were among Putin’s guests attending the annual parade in Moscow.
Ukraine has reported many hundreds of Russian attacks along frontline locations during the ceasefire period, though missile and Shahed drone attacks on Ukraine’s cities have not been seen since Wednesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/world/ukraine-hungary-spy-network-intl,Ukraine says it has uncovered Hungarian spy network working in border region,2025-05-09 13:55:15,"Ukraine said Friday it had exposed a network of Hungarian spies trying to obtain defense secrets in a border region of Ukraine – the first time it said such an operation has been discovered.
The Security Services of Ukraine (SBU) said it had detained two Hungarian special services agents, whom it claims were reporting to a handler in Hungarian military intelligence and were looking for ground and air defense vulnerabilities in the southwestern Zakarpattia region, which borders Hungary.
“Comprehensive measures are currently underway to bring all members of the Hungarian intelligence network to justice,” said the statement.
The news triggered a series of diplomatic tit-for-tats on Friday.
Hungary responded to the arrests by expelling two of the staff at the Ukrainian embassy in Budapest.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on his Facebook page that two spies who had been working “under diplomatic cover” at the embassy were ordered to leave.
Later Friday, Ukraine summoned the Hungarian ambassador and ordered two diplomats to leave the country within 48 hours.
“We are acting in response to Hungary’s actions, based on the principle of reciprocity and our national interests,” Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said on social media.
Ukraine and Hungary are at odds over the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and Ukrainian accession to the European Union. Hungary has also criticized European sanctions against Moscow.
The Hungarian government has also frequently complained that the ethnic Hungarian minority in Zakarpattia is discriminated against.
“The past three years have shown that the war in Ukraine is being fought not only on the battlefield, but also in the information space. Anti-Hungarian propaganda is often used without any factual basis,” Szijjarto said in a post on X in response to the arrests.
Speaking to reporters, Szijjarto said: “If we receive any details or official information, then we will be able to deal with this. Until then, I must classify this as propaganda that must be handled with caution.”
“We will not tolerate smear campaigns against Hungary and the Hungarian people,” he said, before alleging that “anti-Hungarian propaganda has intensified,” since the start of the war.
“We haven’t let Hungary be dragged into this war — and we won’t. That’s exactly why we keep being targeted,” Szijjarto said.
Ukraine’s SBU said the Hungarian spies were tasked with gathering information about the military security and studying the views of residents and “behavior scenarios” if Hungarian troops entered Zakarpattia.
The SBU alleged that one man from Berehove in Zakarpattia was recruited in 2021 and “activated” last September. It accused him of collecting information on the location of Ukrainian defense systems, including its S-300 anti-aircraft missile system in the region.
It also alleged he had attempted to recruit two other men as he tried to establish a “network of informants.”
The second person detained, a woman who left her unit in Ukraine’s Security and Defense Forces this year, had been tasked with informing the Hungarian special services about the defense systems of her unit and informing on the presence of aircraft and helicopters in the Zakarpattia region, the SBU claimed.
The Zakarpattia region stayed part of Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The region was once part of the former Kingdom of Hungary and later Czechoslovakia.
According to a census in 2001, just over 150,000 ethnic Hungarians lived in the region, but the number is widely thought to have declined since then. Last year, representatives of the Hungarian-speaking community criticized a draft Ukrainian law that would have restricted the use of Hungarian in schools by allowing it to be used only in classroom activities and not outside classroom settings.
The two countries had disagreements over Hungary’s 2011 decision to relax its naturalization procedures and allow anyone who can speak Hungarian and has Hungarian ancestry to gain citizenship – even if they have never stepped a foot in the country. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians were granted Hungarian passports since then, despite Ukraine not allowing dual citizenship.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has opposed Ukraine’s accession to the EU in part because of claims that ethnic Hungarians in western Ukraine face discrimination.
Orban has remained on good terms with Moscow throughout the conflict and has opposed the growing raft of EU sanctions against Russia as well as EU aid packages for Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Orban said EU President Ursula von der Leyen “wants to pour further billions into Ukraine, pull Europe further into a losing war, and rush a bankrupt state into the EU.”
“Hungary won’t go along with this,” he said.","['Svitlana Vlasova', 'Tim Lister', 'Todd Symons']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/europe/ukraine-cynical-about-putin-ceasefire-latam-intl,Ukrainians on front line say Russians keep breaking Putin’s ceasefire,2025-05-09 00:51:41,"The weather was bad along the front line as the hour approached. Heavy clouds and rain meant activity by the two warring parties was always likely to be on the lower side.
But as the clock approached midnight Wednesday, the time the Kremlin said its guns would fall silent for three days, the men at the National Guard monitoring center in eastern Ukraine had absolutely no faith in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ceasefire.
“My answer is simple – we don’t believe him,” said Kir, a drone special unit commander, expressing a view shared by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has repeatedly said he is only interested in an immediate 30-day pause in the fighting.
As nightfall approached Thursday, almost a full day into the Russian leader’s ceasefire, Ukrainian officials were reporting continued attacks across the front line.
Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said there had been more than 500 attacks on Ukrainian troop positions over the course of the day, along with at least 10 strikes by guided aerial bombs, one of which killed a 55-year-old woman and wounded her son in the northern Sumy region.
In the southern Kherson region, a 35-year-old woman was killed in a drone strike, officials said.
Working from a nondescript building in a location we were told not to disclose, Kir and his colleagues were looking out for Russian attacks. Monitors on the desks and on the walls showed more than 100 live feeds from surveillance drones, operating across almost half the front line.
About 60 cameras were trained on the Donetsk region alone. Mavic drones only tonight, Kir explained, because of the bad weather. Usually there would be even more feeds to look at.
A few minutes after midnight, the men were reporting Russian activity. Artillery fire near Pokrovsk. A Grad rocket fired near Toretsk, and another instance of artillery fire, this time near Sloviansk. Attacks were on the low side, Kir said, though his attention was drawn to very high surveillance drone activity by Russian forces.
He was clear about Putin’s true intentions. When the Russian leader called an earlier snap ceasefire over Easter – which Ukraine said it had “mirrored” – Russia took the opportunity to re-supply positions and move troops, Kir said.
And it had benefited them, he added: “They struck successfully after Easter, and we lost some positions.”
He said he expected further infantry moves during the latest ceasefire.
The National Guardsmen had other evidence they said proved the Kremlin has absolutely no interest in peace.
Surveillance feeds have been showing them for several weeks that Russia is moving significant numbers of troops and hardware into positions just a few dozen kilometers back from the front line.
They played CNN a video filmed just a few days ago showing a vast network of dugouts, tarpaulins and vehicles, carefully spaced along a seemingly endless tree line.
“Remember Crimea?” Kir asked, referring to Russian’s invasion of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014, which Moscow denied at first, before moving quickly to illegally annex the territory.
“They started with a lie. And they’re still lying.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/07/europe/putin-victory-day-ceasefire-ukraine-latam-intl,"Putin’s 3-day ceasefire comes into effect, but Ukraine claims Russia already broke it",2025-04-29 00:00:00,"Kyiv accused Moscow of breaching its own ceasefire on Thursday, saying Russian forces struck hundreds of times along the front lines and launched guided bombs that killed and wounded civilians in several Ukrainian cities.
The three-day ceasefire scheduled around the anniversary of Russia’s World War II Victory Day on Friday was unilaterally declared by Russian President Vladimir Putin last month. It was meant to come into effect at midnight local time (5 p.m. ET) on Wednesday.
A statement from the Kremlin last month said Putin ordered “all military actions” in Ukraine to be suspended from midnight May 8 to midnight May 11 based on “humanitarian considerations.”
Russian state news agency Tass reported the ceasefire started as scheduled – yet the fighting appeared to have continued, according to Ukraine’s Air Force.
Russia launched guided bombs over Sumy in northeastern Ukraine and Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, the military and local authorities said in a post on Telegram.
A 55-year-old woman was killed and her son was wounded in the Sumy region early Thursday morning, according to the Prosecutor’s Office in the Sumy region. About half an hour later, a 70-year-old woman was wounded when another bomb landed in the Vorozhba area, the local prosecutor said.
The head of the Kherson regional military administration said a 35-year-old woman was killed Thursday as a result of a Russian drone strike on one of the villages on the region. He also reported several drones in the area.
CNN has not independently verified these claims.
Ukraine’s Air Force said there had been no Russian missile or drone attacks in its airspace on Thursday morning.
Viktor Tregubov, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military’s Khortytsia operational and strategic grouping, said Russian troops were “less active” Thursday morning.
“In some areas, there were no clashes in the morning, but there were active hostilities in a number of other (areas), so we cannot talk about a ceasefire,” he said, adding Russian troops had launched assault operations near Lyman, Vovchansk, Kramatorsk, Chasiv Yar, Toretks and Pokrovsk since it was supposed to begin at midnight.
Russia also accused Ukraine of violating the ceasefire, even though Kyiv rejected the short-term truce when it was first announced.
The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed in a statement its troops “ceased all hostilities” and accused Ukraine of continuing to strike. It said Russia would “mirror” Ukraine’s actions.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Putin’s announcement a “theatrical performance” and reiterated his country’s support for an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, which Russia has rejected.
The three-day period Putin picked for the ceasefire coincides with Russia’s World War II Victory Day commemorations, including a traditional military parade, set for Friday, May 9.
The high-profile event is expected to be attended by the leaders of several countries that are friendly with Russia, including China’s Xi Jinping.
As in previous years, it is expected to be used by Putin and his government to peddle propaganda, which falsely frames Moscow’s current aggression against Ukraine as a fight against a “Nazi” regime in Kyiv.
Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union during WWII, but it celebrates its Victory Day on May 8, having moved the holiday from May 9 after the Russian invasion to align itself with Europe.
In a speech commemorating the anniversary Thursday, Zelensky said Russia’s celebrations on Friday would be “a parade of cynicism.”
“The atrocities of the Nazis will be brought up by the organizer of mass (killings) in Bucha. And those who orchestrated the blockade of Mariupol will be the ones talking about the siege of Leningrad,” he said.
“Thank God Ukraine has broken free from all of this. Thank God Ukraine has not forgotten that 80 years ago, dozens of peoples fought against Nazism. And more than 8 million Ukrainians, sadly, died in that struggle,” he added.
Ukrainian drones shut Moscow airports
As Russia prepared to mark the anniversary of the end of WWII, Ukrainian drones attacked Moscow for the second consecutive night overnight into Wednesday.
The attacks forced Russian authorities to temporarily halt air traffic at 13 airports Wednesday – four in Moscow and nine further afield.
More drones were flying Wednesday, with Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin saying one drone that was heading to Moscow was shot down Wednesday afternoon.
The shutting down of airports was potentially embarrassing for Moscow, as delegations from countries that have remained friendly to Russia were flying in to attend the parade Friday.
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Vietnamese President To Lam and Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko are among the 29 leaders on the guest list, according to Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov.
Ukraine has previously said it “cannot be responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation” because of the war.
Zelensky said his country would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin’s exit from isolation on May 9.”
While Russia has rejected the US ceasefire proposal, the unilateral ceasefire around the Victory Day celebration was the second short-term truce Putin announced in less than a month.
In a surprise move over Easter, the Russian leader announced he instructed his troops to stop all military activity for some 30 hours. Ukraine accused Russia of breaching the truce, although it did say fighting had slowed along some parts of the front lines.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/europe/putin-russia-victory-day-threat-ukraine-intl-cmd,Drone threat looms over Moscow as Russia marks annual Victory Day,2025-05-07 00:00:00,"Every year, the spring rain clouds over Moscow are carefully seeded with powerful chemicals to ensure clear skies for the annual May 9 Victory Day parade, Russia’s most important show of national pride.
This year, the threat from above comes not from rain showers, but squadrons of potentially lethal Ukrainian drones.
Already, in the days running up to this year’s parade on Red Square, multiple drone strikes have forced airspace closures at all four Moscow airports and heightened anxiety across the Russian capital.
Elsewhere, in distant Russian-annexed Crimea, local Victory Day parades have already been cancelled due to acute security concerns.
But the main event in Moscow is simply too important to abandon, so it is going ahead amid fraying nerves in the Kremlin.
And not without reason.
The often spectacular and colorful military display commemorates the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II and the millions of Russian lives lost in that conflict. More importantly perhaps for the Kremlin, it is a means of showcasing modern Russian firepower and rallying patriotic support for the strongman Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
This year’s 80th anniversary event is particularly significant to the Kremlin and, therefore, may prove a particularly tempting target for those who wish the Kremlin ill – not least Ukraine’s increasingly capable drone operators, whose own cities have suffered near-daily deadly Russian assaults from the air.
Tens of thousands of patriotic Russians are expected to line the streets, applauding as tanks and intercontinental ballistic missile launchers rumble past.
Putin has also invited an impressive array of foreign leaders, including Xi Jinping of China and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in part to project a personal return to the world stage.
The leaders of Belarus, Venezuela, Cuba, Vietnam and the Republic of the Congo are also expected to attend, alongside presidents of several fellow former Soviet states.
Notably, the Kremlin says at least two European leaders, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, will attend the event. European Union officials have warned that Serbia’s bid to join the bloc may be jeopardized if he shows up.
Despite the large-scale gathering of world leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – who has criticized as insufficient a Russian call for a three-day ceasefire during the Victory Day commemorations – isn’t ruling out an attack either by his forces or by sympathizers inside Russia.
In a recent address, Zelensky – who says there must be a ceasefire of at least 30 days to allow for next steps to be prepared – warned that Kyiv “cannot be responsible for what happens” in Russia due to the ongoing conflict, and won’t be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin’s exit from isolation on May 9.”
The words, which the Russian foreign ministry says amount to a direct Ukrainian threat, are overshadowing an event which would otherwise mark a culmination of significant wins for the Kremlin on the Ukrainian battlefield and, crucially, in international diplomacy.
China remains an important Russian backer and the high-profile presence of Xi at the Victory Day parade testifies to the strength of that bond.
But even more important, perhaps, is the dramatic, even startling, improvement in relations with the United States under Trump, whose administration has seemed determined to seek the restoration of friendly economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow, even at the risk of alienating traditional allies.
A recent US peace proposal, for example, suggested the Trump administration would formally recognize the Crimean peninsula – illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014 – as Russian territory, overturning years of stated US policy.
Likewise, Trump’s wavering military support for Ukraine, tariffs on close US allies and threats of annexing Canada and Greenland, have placed unprecedented strains on the Western alliance, while being met with joyful praise in Russia.
In a sign of the feverish optimism, Russian state-controlled media outlets have even speculated that Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State and Trump’s current acting national security adviser, would personally attend the May 9 Victory Day parade – alongside North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, no less – although the Kremlin officially refuses to confirm it is expecting either figure to attend. The White House has not confirmed that any US representative will be present.
But every silver lining, as they say, has a cloud. And things are not all going the Kremlin’s way.
The security threat hanging over the Victory Day parade in Moscow potentially foreshadows the looming challenges for the Kremlin in its ongoing war in Ukraine, which shows precious little sign of abating.
Latest Western estimates of Russian casualties, unconfirmed by the Kremlin, which has been customarily tight-lipped on the matter, are fast approaching an appalling one million people killed or injured, a figure that is only likely to increase if the fighting continues.
There are also ominous signs that the up-until-now resilient Russian economy may finally start to buckle as global crude oil prices, essential for Moscow’s coffers, continue to plunge amid fears of a global economic slowdown.
Meanwhile, worryingly for Moscow, a frustrated Trump, who before taking office bragged that he could end the Ukraine war quickly, has been confounded in that ambition and left contemplating renewed military support for Ukraine and fresh sanctions on Moscow.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/vance-russia-ukraine-talks,"Vance says Russia ‘asking for too much’ in concessions, while Trump says decisions ‘have to be made’ soon",2025-05-07 19:18:10,"Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that the Russians are “asking for too much” in requirements to end the war with Ukraine and that he believes it’s time the two sides come together in “direct negotiation.”
“I wouldn’t say that the Russians are uninterested in bringing this thing to a resolution. What I would say is, right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they’re asking for too much,” Vance said during a Q&A session at the Munich Leaders Meeting in Washington, DC — his second time in recent months addressing the group after a blistering speech in Germany in which he criticized European allies.
Asked about Vance’s comments on Russia later Wednesday, President Donald Trump appeared unaware of them, but said, “Well, it’s possible that’s right. He may know some things that, uh – because I’ve been dealing with this and some other things.”
The president went on to reiterate the administration’s warning that there isn’t indefinite tolerance for negotiations that do not make progress as he grows frustrated at his inability to end the war.
“We are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made. I’m not happy about it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’m not happy about it.”
During his remarks, Vance said the Trump administration had moved beyond the US-proposed 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine had accepted, noting that Russia had said it “is not in our strategic interest.”
“What the Russians have said – again, you don’t have to agree with it, but it’s important to understand where the other side is coming from – what the Russians have said, is a 30-day ceasefire is not in our strategic interest,” Vance said. “We’ve tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on the, what would the long-term settlement look like, and we’ve tried to consistently advance the ball.”
The next step, Vance stressed, is getting Russia and Ukraine to talk directly to each other.
“We would like both the Russians and the Ukrainians to actually agree on some basic guidelines for sitting down and talking to one another,” Vance said. “Obviously, the United States is happy to participate in those conversations, but it’s very important for the Russians and the Ukrainians to start talking to one another. We think that is the next big step that we would like to take.”
He added: “We think it’s probably impossible for us to mediate this entirely without at least some direct negotiation between the two.”
Vance emphasized that he’s “not yet a pessimist” on the chances of the conflict ending and called Trump a “genuine humanitarian” for wanting to see the fighting end.
“Our strong view is that the continuation of this conflict is bad for us. It’s bad for Europe, it’s bad for Russia and it’s bad for Ukraine. We think that if cool heads prevail here, we can bring this thing to a durable peace that will be economically beneficial for both Ukrainians and the Russians, and most importantly, will stop the end of the of the destruction of human lives,” Vance added.
In an interview a day earlier, the Trump administration’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia called President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to agree to the 30-day truce the main “impediment” to progress on peace talks and said Ukraine is willing to create a demilitarized zone inside its territory as part of a potential ceasefire agreement.
“Our impediment to progress is the president of Russia right now not agreeing to (the 30-day ceasefire),” Keith Kellogg told Fox News, adding that it was in the Kremlin leader’s interest to agree to the ceasefire because “the Russians are not winning this war.”
Kyiv has previously said it would be willing to freeze the conflict along the current lines of contact as part of a ceasefire — but has not given any concrete public proposals on a demilitarized zone. CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian government for comment.
Putin has proposed a three-day ceasefire around the celebrations of the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected that offer and reiterated his support for the 30-day truce.
Vance says US and Europe on ‘the same team’
Vance’s appearance Wednesday came months after giving a fiery speech in Germany where he accused European leaders of turning from shared values, such as free speech, and downplayed threats from Russia.
While that speech was not a focus of Wednesday’s meeting, it did not go unmentioned.
Off the top, Wolfgang Ischinger — the former chairman of the conference and now president of the MSC Foundation Council — held up a brochure the group published about Vance’s remarks and reaction to it from across the world, which he said “kicked off a controversial debate about fundamental values unlike anything we have ever had at the Munich Security Conference.”
Vance struck a more conciliatory tone, saying that Europe and the US are “on the same team.”
“I think that European civilization and American civilization, European culture and American culture, are very much linked, and they’re always going to be linked,” Vance said. “And I think it’s, it’s completely ridiculous to think that you’re ever going to be able to drive a firm wedge between the United States and Europe.”
Reiterating his and Trump’s view that the Europeans need to boost their own defense spending, Vance said conversations about security posture and other “big questions” should be rethought together.
In closing remarks after the Q&A, Vance joked about the controversy surrounding his previous speech, appearing to smooth things over.
“I appreciate the kind words, and I appreciate the invitation back. I wasn’t sure after February whether I’d get the invitation back,” he said.
Ischinger chimed in, “Well, we thought about it…”

The former president also said he is less concerned about democracy being under threat in the US than he was in the past “because I think the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about.”

He continued, “I meant what I said when I started that I think I’m preparing to hand this to the next generation, the transition government. But things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away. It was a hard decision.”
Biden spent much of his presidency grappling with the war in Ukraine, working to rally European allies to aid the country and attempting to apply pressure on Russia through sanctions.

Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said in a Telegram post Tuesday that at least 19 Ukrainian drones were destroyed on their approach to the capital overnight, one night after Russian air defenses shot down four drones near the city.
There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, but debris from downed drones fell on a major highway, Sobyanin said. Flights were temporarily suspended as a safety precaution at four of the capital’s airports, according to Russian aviation authorities. Flights at some of the affected airports, in and outside the capital, have since resumed.

The latest Ukrainian attack on the Russian capital comes ahead of Xi’s expected arrival in Moscow on Wednesday for a three-day state visit, in which the Chinese leader will take part in Friday’s May 9 Victory Day celebrations, according to a Kremlin statement Sunday.
Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Vietnam’s President To Lam and Belarussian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko are among 29 leaders expected to attend, according to Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov. North Korea will send an ambassador to Moscow – and India, Nicaragua and South Africa will be represented by high-level delegations, he said.
Victory Day is the most significant day in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s calendar, as he has long used it to rally public support and demonstrate the country’s military prowess.
Thousands of people are expected to line the streets of Moscow’s Red Square on Friday in an exhibition of patriotism marking the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazi Germany and commemorating the more than 25 million Soviet soldiers and civilians who died during World War II.
Kyiv called on international allies not to send troops to Russia’s Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, warning that participation would amount to “sharing responsibility for the blood of Ukrainian children, civilians, and military personnel.”
“The participation of foreign military personnel in this event is unacceptable and will be regarded by Ukraine as a desecration of the memory of the victory over Nazism,” the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday.
Troops from 13 countries are set to take part in the parade, Russia’s presidential aid said. The parade will involve marching units from Azerbaijan, Vietnam, China, and Egypt among others, Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.
Russian authorities have already pulled scheduled celebrations in parts of the country – just hours after the Ukrainian salvo overnight. In the south, there will be no Victory Parade in Sevastopol, occupied Crimea, or in the city of Krasnador, according to local governors.
Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-backed head of Sevastopol, announced commemorations were canceled “for security reasons,” in a decision mandated by Russia’s defense ministry. Similarly, Kuban Veniamin Kondratyev, the head of Krasnador, warned such celebrations posed “a big risk.”
“An air threat is announced almost every night. Of course, we cannot risk the residents of Krasnodar, those who come to the parade, the participants in the parade,” said Kondratyev.
Ukraine won’t be ‘playing games’
Putin last month declared a unilateral three-day ceasefire in Ukraine to coincide with the May 9 celebrations based on what he called “humanitarian considerations,” prompting skepticism in Kyiv.
Following the attacks on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Kyiv of “continuing the war,” insisting that the Easter truce “is still relevant.” But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly criticized the three-day ceasefire, saying he was only ready to sign up for a longer truce of at least 30 days.
Since April 29, when Putin called for the Victory Day truce, the Ukrainian army has accused Moscow of launching around 1,856 attacks along the expansive front lines. In that time, Russian attacks have killed at least 46 civilians and injured another 337 in Ukraine, according to a CNN tally of figures from local authorities and emergency services.
A Russian missile strike on the outskirts of Sumy in central Ukraine on Tuesday killed three people, including a six-year-old boy, Sumy’s regional military administration said. Eight people were being treated in medical facilities, two of whom were in “extremely serious condition,” the authorities added.
Meanwhile, the White House renewed calls for a “permanent ceasefire” as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on Moscow and Kyiv to agree to a deal to end the war. But those negotiations have largely stalled.
In a message to dignitaries traveling to Russia for the Victory Day celebrations, the Ukrainian leader warned that Kyiv “cannot be responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,” due to the ongoing conflict.
Kyiv won’t be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin’s exit from isolation on 9 May,” Zelensky said in his nightly address on Saturday.
In response, Russia’s foreign ministry said his comments amounted to a threat.
Zelensky has demanded answers from China in recent weeks, after he revealed that two Chinese fighters had been captured by Ukraine in early April and claimed there were “many more” in Russia’s ranks.
Beijing denied any involvement and repeated previous calls for Chinese citizens to “refrain from participating in military actions of any party.”
Kyiv has increasingly turned to drones to level the playing field with Russia, which boasts superior manpower and resources. On Saturday, Ukraine claimed it shot down a Russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea using a seaborne drone for the first time.
Meanwhile, a Ukrainian official told CNN the country’s military retains a presence inside Russia’s Kursk, days after Moscow said it had completely recaptured the western region following a months-long incursion by Kyiv’s forces.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/05/europe/europe-nato-us-military-graphics-cmd-intl-dg,Is Europe ready to defend itself? Four key charts tell the story,2025-05-05 10:00:51,"The Trump administration has sent an unmistakable message to Europe: You’re on your own.
In three dizzying months, the White House has reversed decades’ worth of American foreign policy, pledged to scale back its presence on the continent, and pushed to wrap up Russia’s war in Ukraine, even if that might mean handing Ukrainian land to Moscow.
The new reality is one to which Europe is still adjusting. But 80 years to the week after American and European allies forced the surrender of Nazi Germany, a future in which the continent is left alone to defend itself from the Russian menace is no longer hypothetical.
“Europe has been living for 80 years in a situation in which peace was given for granted. And apparently peace was offered for free,” Roberto Cingolani, a former Italian government minister who’s now chief executive of European defense giant Leonardo, told CNN during a recent visit to the company’s headquarters in northern Italy.
“Now, all of a sudden, after the invasion (of) Ukraine, we realize that peace must be defended.”
A breakneck race is underway in Europe’s NATO-member states to ready the continent in case of confrontation with Russia. The race is winnable: Europe boasts militaries large and expensive enough to at least partially plug the hole Washington is threatening to leave.
But armies in Western Europe need a serious influx of funds and expertise to prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario.
In recent years, Britain, France and Germany have pumped funds into their aging militaries after a plateau in spending during the middle of the 2010s.
But it could be several years until the impact of those funds are felt on the front lines. Troop numbers, weaponry and military readiness have waned in Western Europe since the end of the Cold War. “The high level of attrition in the Ukraine War has painfully highlighted European countries’ current shortcomings,” the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank, wrote in a blunt review of Europe’s forces last year.
Nations nearer the Russian border are moving faster. The Trump administration has hailed Poland as a paragon of self-sufficiency. “We see Poland as the model ally on the continent: willing to invest not just in their defense, but in our shared defense and the defense of the continent,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in Warsaw during the first European bilateral meeting of Trump’s second term.
But Poland’s rapid escalation in defense spending has more to do with its own, generations-old tensions with Russia than with a desire to earn a place in Trump’s good graces. Warsaw and Washington are at odds on the conflict in Ukraine; Poland has for years warned Europe of the threat posed by Russia, and has steadfastly supported its neighbor as it defends territory from Putin’s advances.
The US has stationed troops in Europe since the end of the Cold War, and their numbers have grown since Russia’s full-scale invasion, with around 80,000 on the continent last year, according to a Congressional report. But the deployment is still far smaller than at the height of the Cold War, when nearly half a million American troops were stationed in Europe.
For decades, American foreign policy emphasized the importance of those deployments not just to European security, but to its own. Troops on the continent provide forward defense, help train allied forces, and manage nuclear warheads.
Now, the future of those deployments is not clear. European leaders have publicly urged Washington not to reduce numbers, but Trump, Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance have all made clear their intention to strengthen the US military posture in the South China Sea.
Today, most US land and air bases are located in Germany, Italy and Poland. US bases in central Europe provide a counterweight to the Russian threat, while naval and aerial locations in Turkey, Greece and Italy also support missions in the Middle East.
The locations serve as “a crucial foundation for NATO operations, regional deterrence, and global power projection,” according to the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis think tank.
The most important deterrent Europe holds, however, is its nuclear warheads.
During the early stages of Russia’s war, President Vladimir Putin repeatedly prompted worldwide alarm by hinting at the use of a nuclear weapon. That fear subsided after the war became bogged down in Ukraine’s east.","['Rob Picheta', 'Lou Robinson']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/05/europe/romania-poland-election-simion-trump-intl,Two Trump-friendly nationalists are vying to lead Ukraine’s European neighbors,2025-05-05 11:26:47,"One of them often dons a Trump-style red baseball cap and wants to make his country “great again.” The other visited the US president at the White House to drum up support. Both could soon become presidents of major allies on Ukraine’s border.
In Romania, the hard-right euroskeptic George Simion convincingly won the first round of the presidential re-run on Sunday, making him a strong favorite to win the final round on May 18.
On that same day, Poland will also hold the first round of a presidential ballot, where both the nationalist candidate Karol Nawrocki and the far-right upstart Sławomir Mentzen have been making gains. If no candidate wins more than 50% of votes, a second round will be held two weeks later.
Although victory for Simion is much more likely than for Poland’s right-wing candidates, Europe is now facing the prospect that two of Ukraine’s neighbors could by next month be led by presidents who are hostile towards Brussels and aping a MAGA-style politics.
“Congratulations,” Nawrocki said to Simion on Monday in a message of support on X.
Also hailing Simion’s first-round victory, Mentzen jokingly asked if Romanian authorities “will cancel the elections again.” This was a reference to the decision last year by Romania’s constitutional court to annul the first-round victory of Calin Georgescu, a Kremlin-friendly ultranationalist, after intelligence services pointed to possible Russian interference in his TikTok-fueled campaign, which he and Moscow denied. Georgescu was later banned from May’s re-run, after prosecutors charged him with establishing a fascist group and other crimes.
The court’s decision to cancel the election had little precedent, outraged many in the country and caught the attention of officials in the Trump administration. In his blistering speech in Munich in February, US Vice President JD Vance singled out Romania as the grossest case of what he called Europe’s “threat from within.”
Sunday’s first-round results showed the court’s decision did little to quell Romania’s simmering nationalist fervor and may even have inflamed it. Whereas Georgescu secured 22% of votes in November, Simion won a resounding 41% in May’s do-over, far exceeding polling expectations. His nearest contender, Nicusor Dan, the centrist mayor of the capital Bucharest, came second at around 21%.
Many in Brussels will be hoping that the pro-European Union voters will rally around Dan in the second round, shutting the far-right out of power, as happened in France in its parliamentary election last year. But analysts say divisions among the mainstream parties mean Simion is likely to win the May 18 second round.
Although Romania, like Poland, has a parliamentary system, the presidents of both countries are commanders of the armed forces and have significant sway over military spending and foreign policy.
While not as brazen as Georgescu, Simion shares many of his views and even cast his ballot alongside him on Sunday. Simion has long voiced his opposition to military aid for Ukraine, and last year was banned by Kyiv from entering the country, citing his “systematic anti-Ukrainian activities.” He is also barred from visiting neighboring Moldova. Simion has claimed he is not anti-Ukraine or pro-Russia, but simply “pro-Romanian.”
In Poland, the picture is less clear-cut. With President Andrzej Duda of the conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) unable to run for a third term, Karol Nawrocki – currently head of Poland’s Institute of National Remembrance – is attempting to pick up his mantle. Meanwhile, Sławomir Mentzen, a leader of the far-right Confederation Liberty and Independence alliance, has climbed up the polls – but is deemed unlikely to reach the second round.
Although technically running as an independent, Nawrocki has the backing of PiS, which became increasingly authoritarian over its eight years in power, before its defeat in a 2023 parliamentary election by an alliance led by Donald Tusk’s liberal Civic Platform party.
Nawrocki met Trump at the White House last week to mark the National Day of Prayer. “President Trump said, ‘you will win,’” Nawrocki told private broadcaster TV Republika after his reception in the Oval Office.
Nawrocki has accused Volodymyr Zelensky of behaving “indecently” towards his allies, echoing criticism by Vance that the Ukrainian president is not sufficiently “grateful” for the support his country receives. In the fallout from Zelensky’s Oval Office meeting with Trump and Vance, Tusk – prime minister since 2023 – said it is “becoming clear who in Poland wants to pursue Russian interests.”
Currently polling at around 25%, Nawrocki is trailing Rafał Trzaskowski, the centrist mayor of Warsaw representing Tusk’s Civic Platform party, who is leading at around 33%.
But Simion’s overperforming polling expectations will provide encouragement to Poland’s conservative candidates.
Mentzen said Simion’s first-round victory showed that “Romanians again want to choose differently than the EU elites would like.” Further to the right than Nawrocki, Mentzen has also tacked closely to Trump, calling for a MAGA-style “revolution of common sense” in Poland.",['Christian Edwards'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/04/europe/putin-speech-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-intl-latam,Russia’s Putin says he hopes there will be no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine,2025-05-04 21:32:56,"President Vladimir Putin said in remarks published on Sunday that Russia had sufficient strength and resources to take the war in Ukraine to its logical conclusion, though he hoped that there would be no need to use nuclear weapons.
Putin ordered thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022, triggering Europe’s biggest ground conflict since World War II and the largest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers have been killed or injured and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to end the “bloodbath” that his administration casts as a proxy war between the United States and Russia.
In a film by state television about Putin’s quarter of a century as Russia’s paramount leader titled “Russia, Kremlin, Putin, 25 years,” Putin was asked by a reporter about the risk of nuclear escalation from the Ukraine war.
“They wanted to provoke us so that we made mistakes,” Putin said, speaking beside a portrait of Tsar Alexander III, a 19th century conservative who suppressed dissent. “There has been no need to use those weapons … and I hope they will not be required.”
“We have enough strength and means to bring what was started in 2022 to a logical conclusion with the outcome Russia requires.”
Trump has been signaling for weeks that he is frustrated by the failure of Moscow and Kyiv to reach terms to end the war, though the Kremlin has said that the conflict is so complicated that the rapid progress Washington wants is difficult.
Former US President Joe Biden, Western European leaders and Ukraine cast the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and repeatedly vowed to defeat Russian forces, which control about a fifth of Ukraine.
Putin portrays the war as a watershed moment in Moscow’s relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence.
Trump has warned that the conflict could develop into World War III. Former CIA Director William Burns has said there was a real risk in late 2022 that Russia could use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, an assertion dismissed by Moscow.
Putin in power
Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who was handed the presidency on the last day of 1999 by an ailing Boris Yeltsin, is the longest serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, who ruled for 29 years until his death in 1953.
Russian dissidents – most now either in jail or abroad – see Putin as a dictator who has built a brittle system of personal rule reliant on sycophancy and corruption that is leading Russia towards decline and turmoil.
Supporters cast Putin, who Russian pollsters say has approval ratings of above 85%, as a savior who pushed back against an arrogant West and put an end to the chaos which accompanied the 1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union.
In the carefully choreographed state television film, which gave viewers a rare look behind the notoriously closed life of the Russian president, Putin was shown offering chocolates and a fermented Russian milk drink to Pavel Zarubin, a top Kremlin correspondent, in his private Kremlin kitchen.
Putin said that he first knelt in prayer during the 2002 Nord-Ost Moscow theater crisis, when Chechen militants took over 900 people hostage. More than 130 hostages were killed.
“I don’t feel like some kind of politician,” Putin said of his 25 years in power as president and prime minister.
“I continue to breathe the very same air as millions of Russian citizens. It is very important. God willing that it continues as long as possible. And that it doesn’t disappear.”",[],en

“This is the first time in the world that a combat aircraft has been destroyed by a marine drone,” the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine said in a statement on Saturday, adding it “burst into flames in the air and eventually fell into the sea.”
Ukraine’s military intelligence said one of its units destroyed the fighter jet on Friday with a Ukrainian Magura drone near the port of Novorossiysk - a key port city for Russia where Ukraine claims there are remnants of Russia’s Black Sea fleet.
CNN could not independently verify Ukraine’s claims.
Russia’s defense ministry has not commented on the incident, although the claim was backed up by a Russian military blogger.
“The Ukrainians brought more than three dozen sea-drones… to the Novorossiysk area… After [our] jet was hit, the crew ended up in the water, surrounded by enemy sea-drones,” Fighterbomber said on Telegram Saturday.
Ukraine’s military intelligence claimed in December last year it destroyed two Russian helicopters “for the first time in the world” using the seaborne Magura V5 missile drone created by Ukraine’s military and engineers.
Kyiv has increasingly turned to drones to level the playing field with Russia, which boasts superior manpower and resources. Since Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 – and following further losses after Russia’s 2022 invasion – Ukraine no longer has a functioning navy in the Black Sea.
Drones have proved effective against some of the toughest ships of Moscow’s Black Sea fleet. They are controlled from afar via a Starlink connection and can be pre-programmed for the long journeys across the Black Sea.
In February last year, Ukraine said it sank the Ivanovets, a Russian guided-missile ship in the Black Sea. Its most notable strike was on the Moskva in April 2022, which was a huge morale boost for Kyiv in the early weeks of the war.
After the attack on the Ivanovets, CNN interviewed Ukraine’s secretive sea drone unit behind the strike at a location near the Ukrainian coastal city of Odesa. One of the drone pilots behind the attack told CNN that 10 Magura drones were used in the attack, six of which hit and ultimately sunk the Russian warship.
One of Ukraine’s drone pilots told CNN the drones are quite difficult to see in open sea, making it hard for Russians to target.",['Eve Brennan'],en

Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance poured some cold water on earlier statements from the White House, while also claiming that US President Donald Trump managed to secure “a really big breakthrough” in the peace process.
“It’s going to be up to them (Ukraine and Russia) to come to an agreement and stop this brutal, brutal conflict. It’s not going anywhere. It’s not going to end anytime soon,” Vance told Fox News.
“Of course they (the Ukrainians) are angry that they were invaded, but are we going to continue to lose thousands and thousands of soldiers over a few miles of territory this or that way? I hope both of them come to their senses.”
Trump suggested just last week that Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” after his foreign envoy, Steve Witkoff, spent three hours meeting with Putin at the Kremlin.
Talks to end the war — which Trump previously promised to do within 24 hours of taking office — have largely stalled, despite several top level meetings and at least two direct phone calls between Trump and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Moscow continues to refuse the 30-day ceasefire agreement proposed by the US and agreed by Ukraine. The Kremlin also demands the recognition of the Ukrainian territories it took by force as part of Russia. Such a move would upend decades-long international laws.
At the same time, Russia continues its brutal aggression against Ukraine, bombing cities hundreds of miles away from the frontlines on an almost daily basis.
Vance said that the fact that the talks were happening was itself a victory.
“I really don’t believe that any person, the 8 billion people in the world, I don’t think anybody could have gotten this deal done other than Donald J. Trump. When I say this deal, I mean getting these guys to actually propose a peace settlement,” the vice president told Fox News.
Earlier this week, Putin declared a unilateral three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8 to May 11. In response, the Trump administration and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for a permanent truce.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to flip-flop between blaming Moscow and blaming Kyiv for the lack of progress.
Last week, Trump slammed Zelensky for his comments that Ukraine wouldn’t recognize Russian control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula that was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, calling the remarks “very harmful to the peace negotiations with Russia.”
“It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
Yet on Saturday, after speaking to Zelensky privately on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral, Trump questioned whether Putin “maybe… doesn’t want to stop the war.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/politics/intelligence-putin-war-goals-shifted-ukraine,Vladimir Putin: Intelligence suggests Russian leader’s immediate goals for Ukraine war may have shifted,2025-04-10 00:00:00,"New intelligence reviewed by US and Western officials suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin may have shifted his immediate focus in the Ukraine war toward the shorter-term objectives of solidifying his hold on territory his forces have seized and boosting his country’s struggling economy, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN.
This represents an evolution from recent US and Western intelligence assessments suggesting that Putin felt the state of the war was to his advantage, that he had the momentum as well as the manpower to sustain a longer fight against a faltering Ukraine and seize the entire country.
The perception Putin may have shifted his thinking has played into President Donald Trump and his negotiators’ belief that the Russian president may be more willing to consider a potential peace deal than in the past, two US sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
However, senior US officials remain skeptical of Putin and his repeated assertions in ongoing talks that he wants a peace deal, even though what is being proposed by the US is incredibly generous to Russia, handing them most of the territory they’ve taken. There is also a widespread belief that even if Russia agrees to a version of the agreement on the table it may look to resume the war and try to seize more of Ukraine in the long-term.
“I think that he may be thinking - I don’t want to say thinking smaller - but thinking about what a reasonable nearer-term objective is,” said a senior western intelligence official.
The pressure exerted by an increasingly angry Trump administration, threatening more sanctions and a struggling Russian economy, have Putin in a potentially difficult position. There has also been strong emphasis in talks on the potential for investments between the US and Russia if the war ends, opportunities the US has called “historic.”
“All of this really depends on what is the US willing to put on the table so that he could not just claim victory domestically,” the official continued, “but really feel that he has achieved something that is worth a significant pause and then maybe retake up the fight at some point later.”
The official pointed to Putin’s repeated references to where the Russian people have historically come from and said he maintains “a long-term objective,” to seize more of Ukraine, “at least those portions that are the cradle of Russian civilization” in Putin’s eyes.
Moscow is willing to “play along” with the US and restrict its immediate objectives to improve its relationship with Washington, a senior European official agreed, but “clearly hasn’t given up on their maximalist war ends.”
The Kremlin hopes that a better relationship “draws the attention away after a tactical pause and that they can then use the mix of military, economic, informational and political tools to achieve Putin’s full objectives in Ukraine and beyond,” the official said.
Earlier this year, US intelligence officials cautioned now-senior Trump advisers that controlling Ukraine remained Putin’s top priority next to regime survival and warned he was eager to exploit any perceived rush to negotiations by the new administration, according to a source familiar with those conversations.
“Putin’s thinking has evolved because he thinks he has a sympathetic US president who doesn’t know what he’s doing and is more interested in short-term wins,” said Democratic Congressman Jason Crow, who sits on the House intelligence committee. Putin, he added, “thinks there can be a settlement, and it simply won’t be enforced.”
Ukraine is pleading for security assistance
During negotiations that started under Trump, Ukraine’s leaders have repeatedly pleaded that the US and Europe provide security assistance and guarantees as part of a potential pact so that even if Ukraine does cede some land, Russia would be deterred from resuming the war to seize more of the country.
“The Russian objective is to get as much territory recognized as possible and have as weak of a Ukraine as possible,” said a senior US official who argued there’s “zero indication” Putin could actually conquer the rest of Ukraine when his forces have been unable to dramatically move the front lines in a long time.
So any shift in Putin’s thinking comes from that realization and the Trump administration’s efforts to get the two sides to negotiate an end to the conflict, said the official.
“The calculation of what more Putin could achieve at this given stage has probably changed, in part because there’s a desire to end the war,” the official said. “The calculus on the US side has changed [since the Biden administration], which contributes to the changing calculus of the Russians presumably.”
Discussions about where territorial lines could be drawn have focused on the five territories where Russia has the strongest foothold, including Crimea which Putin seized in 2014. Trump has said Ukraine will not get back most of the land it has lost to Russia.
Last week, Vice President JD Vance indicated the US envisions an eventual truce “somewhere close” to where the current front lines are with “some territorial swaps.”
“This peace deal is about these so-called five territories. But there’s so much more to it,” d, who has met with Putin four times this year, told Fox News after their third encounter. “I think we might be on the verge of something that would be very important for the world at large.”
CNN has reported that some European allies are highly alarmed by the framework being proposed as the US could recognize territory illegally seized by Russia.
Trump has said the US is ready to recognize Russian sovereignty in Crimea, while Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said this week that Moscow wants international recognition of all five Ukrainian territories Russia fully or partially holds, something Kyiv has said it would refuse to do.
Another senior US official, Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg, said Tuesday that the administration is just waiting on Russia to agree to a ceasefire.
“We’ve got one side [Ukraine], now you need to come up with the other side, and I think we’re close,” he told Fox News. “This is the last 100 yards to an objective. In the military, it’s the toughest 100 yards.”
Doubts Putin is negotiating in good faith
But there has long been doubt among political and intelligence officials that Putin and the circle around him are negotiating in good faith, instead trying to stretch the talks out and continue their military campaign.
Sen. Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed that skepticism this week, telling reporters it is “time to treat Putin like the deceptive war criminal he is” and reminding Trump that the Russian leader “cannot be allowed to drag the United States along.”
Trump has consistently insisted that he believes Putin wants peace and expressed optimism about a potential deal, but on Saturday appeared to question the Russian leader’s aims.
“Maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’ Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican.
“We understand that Washington is willing to achieve a quick success in this process,” Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded on Wednesday. “But at the same time, we hope for an understanding that the settlement in the Ukrainian crisis is too complicated to be done overnight. There are lots of details and lots of tiny things to be tackled before a settlement.”
Trump had referenced recent Russian strikes on Kyiv and elsewhere that the senior western intelligence official said are in line with the argument that Putin is not engaging in truce talks with an intention of ending the war.
“But if something gets put on the table that is too good to pass up, I think that they could change the way they’re thinking a little bit on that,” said the official.","['Alex Marquardt', 'Zachary Cohen']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/world/what-we-know-about-trumps-ukraine-mineral-deal-intl,Here’s what’s in Trump’s Ukraine minerals deal and how it affects the war,2025-05-01 11:58:06,"Ukraine managed to wrangle some more favorable terms out of the United States before signing the long-awaited minerals deal on Wednesday.
The agreement on natural resources was finally struck late on Wednesday, after weeks of tense bargaining that at times turned sour and temporarily halted Washington’s aid to Ukraine.
Kyiv eventually convinced US President Donald Trump to drop some of his key demands but failed to make American security guarantees part of the agreement.
Ukrainian officials touted the final accord as an equal partnership between Kyiv and Washington – a notable shift from some of the earlier drafts which were described by Ukraine’s leader President Volodymyr Zelensky as the US asking him to “sell my country.”
The signed deal, seen by CNN, does indeed appear to be more favorable to Ukraine than some of the previous versions. Here’s what we know.
What’s in the deal?
Aid: Crucially, the deal does not call for Kyiv to reimburse the US for the aid it has already received – a key concession from Trump who has long framed the agreement as Ukraine “paying back” the US.
Washington initially demanded a $500 billion share of Ukraine’s rare earths and other minerals in exchange for the aid it has already provided to Kyiv. When Zelensky rejected that idea, Trump called him “a dictator.”
Instead, the agreement that was inked on Wednesday says that future American military assistance to Ukraine will count as part of the US investment into a joint reconstruction investment fund that will be used to pour money into Ukraine’s natural resources.
Natural resources: The deal gives the US preferential rights to mineral extraction in Ukraine and states that Kyiv will have the final say in what and where is being mined. Ukraine will also retain the ownership of the subsoil.
“All resources on our territory and in our territorial waters belong to Ukraine. It is the Ukrainian state that determines where and what to extract,” said Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who signed the deal on behalf her country.
And although Trump has referred to the agreement as a “rare earth” deal, the accord signed on Wednesday goes well beyond that by including other natural resources such as oil, natural gas, gold and copper.
The tone: In a win for Ukraine, the deal also adopts a strong language on the war with Russia itself. It points at Moscow as the aggressor in the conflict, diverging from some of Trump’s previous false statements about Ukraine and Zelensky being responsible for the war.
The deal also spells out the goal of the agreement as “a peaceful, sovereign and resilient Ukraine” – a notable step away from Trump saying earlier this year that, “Ukraine may be Russia some day.”
EU guarantees: It also keeps the door open for Ukraine’s potential future membership in the European Union, saying that investment needs to be made in accordance with Ukraine’s obligations as an EU candidate state. It adds that if Ukraine was to join the bloc in the future, this deal would be renegotiated “in good faith.”
A boost for the US: But the terms of the agreement also show the US has secured a host of advantages for itself.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent characterized it as a “historic economic partnership,” saying in a statement that it “signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term.”
The agreement seen by CNN also specifies that the earnings and other payments made as part of the deal will be tax-free and not subject to any levies or duties by Ukraine.
It also says that if a conflict arises between the wording of the agreement and Ukraine’s law, the deal will have a legal precedent.
What is missing from the deal?
Security questions: Ukraine has dropped its key demand that the US provides security guarantees as part of this agreement. It was this demand that ultimately led to the shouty meeting between Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office in February.
Trump then refused to provide security guarantees, saying he wanted Ukraine to sign the agreement first and talk about guarantees later.
At the time, Zelensky refused, but Ukrainian officials have since indicated that they believe that US investment and the presence of American companies in Ukraine will make Washington more interested in Ukraine’s security.
Exclusive access for the US: While it ensures the US receives preferential access to Ukraine’s mineral riches, the deal doesn’t guarantee any exclusive rights.
Existing resources: The deal is limited to new projects, which means the US and Ukraine will have to invest in order to see profits. Existing mining operations that are already generating revenue for the Ukrainian government are excluded.
This clause puts a question mark over the benefits of the deal for the US. While Ukraine has large reserves of several valuable materials, the process to extract some of them is expensive and technically difficult.
Gavin Mudd, the director of the Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre at the British Geological Survey, told the non-profit Science Media Center that the production of some minerals – such as titanium, lithium or graphite – could be achieved quickly, if the regions where the deposits are are secure.
“However, in the case of rare earths, it will take years to ramp up capacity – studies will need to be completed to assess and determine how best to mine the deposits and process the ores and produce rich concentrate, and a new refinery will be needed to produce high purity metals and oxides for use in numerous technologies. All of this sits alongside the need to actually mine the minerals” he said.
How does it play into the peace process?
The Ukrainian government has in the past made the argument that its mineral deposits are one of the reasons the West should support Ukraine – to prevent these strategically important resources from falling into Russian hands.
Experts agree with that idea. Liam Peach and Hamad Hussain, economists at Capital Economics, wrote in an analyst note on Thursday that the agreement “provides some reassurance that the Trump administration is not planning on abandoning Ukraine altogether” because it establishes US economic interests in Ukraine.
The deal strengthens Ukraine’s position, but doesn’t necessarily bring the war closer to the end as it is separate from any negotiations with Russia. Those talks appear to be stalling, as Moscow continues to refuse a 30-day ceasefire agreement proposed by the US and agreed by Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the devastating war keeps raging. Seven people died in occupied Ukraine Thursday, with Russian and Ukrainian officials trading claims over the attack
Shelby Magid, the deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, wrote in a note that the deal puts the Ukrainians “in their strongest position yet with Washington since Trump took office.”
How was the deal struck?
The road to it was incredibly rocky, with the US temporarily suspending aid to Ukraine after the disastrous Oval Office meeting.
Negotiations continued behind the scenes in the weeks that followed. In the meantime Trump began losing patience with Putin’s stalling over a peace deal, giving an opening to Kyiv to repair ties.
In the end, it seems that the two leaders just needed to talk to each other privately, without cameras and away from aides who have derailed the process in the past.
Trump and Zelensky spoke at the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday. A photograph of the two of them huddled together inside St. Peter’s Basilica showed them in a discussion, leaning towards each other.
Zelensky said on Thursday the signing of the minerals deal was “the first result of the Vatican meeting.”
“President Trump and I used every minute of our time to the fullest. I am grateful for that,” he said.
It was after this meeting that Trump questioned whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin wants a peace deal and floated the idea of imposing more sanctions on Moscow. Just days later, the minerals deal was signed.
“Ukrainian officials showed they could manoeuvre and persevere to ultimately get a fair deal. While the Trump administration put tremendous pressure on Ukraine to accept earlier deals, Ukraine managed to show that it is not just a junior partner that has to roll over and accept a bad deal,” Magid said.
However, there was some more drama on Wednesday, when a last-minute disagreement over which documents would be signed on Wednesday threatened to derail the deal.
Why are the minerals so important?
Materials such as graphite, lithium, uranium and the 17 chemical elements known as rare earths are critical for economic growth and national security.
They are essential to the production of electronics, clean energy technology, including wind turbines, energy networks and electric vehicles, as well as some weapons systems.
China has long dominated the global production of rare earth minerals and other strategically important materials, leaving Western countries desperate for other alternative sources – including Ukraine.
The US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs. Of the 50 minerals classed as critical, the US was entirely dependent on imports of 12 and more than 50% dependent on imports of a further 16, according to the United States Geological Survey, a government agency.
Ukraine, meanwhile, has deposits of 22 of these 50 critical materials, according to the Ukrainian government.
The country has some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals. Some of these reserves are in areas that are currently under Russian occupation.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Victoria Butenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/world/ukraine-minerals-deal-us-trump-analysis-intl,Ukraine minerals deal is largely symbolic - but that’s enough for Donald Trump,2025-05-01 00:00:00,"It provides both good news and optics, but is ultimately a forced deal with a complex future.
Ukraine’s minerals agreement with the United States stems from months of fraught haggling, and originates in a Ukrainian idea first offered during the amicable climes of the Biden administration. It has since become a persistent thorn in the side of Kyiv and Washington’s febrile relationship. President Volodymyr Zelensky had little choice but to sign something, or risk another seismic rupture in his relationship with President Donald Trump.
Yet the document CNN has seen sets the stage for a longer-term relationship between the US and Ukraine. It does not give an ironclad guarantee of American profits in the next years of the Trump administration.
The symbolism was, however, largely the point. Trump needed to feel America was getting something back from Kyiv. Ukraine needed to show its relationship with this White House was functional and improving. Ukraine’s allies needed this done and dusted to remove a distraction from the complex talk of military aid and real peace that must now become their focus.
The deal’s text also contains two phrases that will be distinctly pleasing to Kyiv. First, it refers to the “large-scale destruction caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine” – an unambiguous statement of blame from a White House that has often preferred to pull its punches. And then it explains how Ukraine might buy arms from the US – vital given the escalating Russian onslaught across the front lines.
It says that if the US gives new military assistance to Ukraine, “the capital contribution of the U.S. Partner (to the fund) will be deemed to be increased by the assessed value of such military assistance”. In short, Ukraine will use this fund to pay for weapons. Until now, it’s been unclear whether the Trump administration would provide arms – especially desperately needed Patriot missile interceptors – at all. Here, they are explaining how Ukraine would pay for them.
It will add to a central message of this beleaguered process: that the pendulum swings of Trump’s position as he tries to broker this peace – vacillating between a wider cosiness with Moscow and maintaining US relations with Europe as a whole – have moved back in Ukraine’s favor. Trump is palpably seeing less progress with Moscow, which continues to reject the US-Ukrainian proposal of a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, itself now nearly 50 days old. The specific terms in the deal of how Ukraine might pay for future arms purchases will ring loud inside the Kremlin’s walls.
The symbolic nature of the document is also partially due to its long-term perspectives and how much political change will likely occur in the decades it needs to start really bringing money to US coffers. Neither Kyiv nor Washington will have the same administrations for more than another three years, even if the war ended tomorrow.
New presidents will choose to honor or revisit the deal. And anyone who has worked or done business in Ukraine knows they are masters at “interpreting” documents and deals in their favor. The world of natural resources is already opaque there, and it is unlikely this high-profile deal will suddenly usher in total business transparency. It’ll likely be messy once the immediate demands of the war end, that much is clear.
So it appears wide-ranging, huge, and game-changing, but at the same time its impact is not immediate, it is largely symbolic – an urgent Band-Aid. Contradictory and complex, but likely loud and clear enough for Trump.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/30/europe/ukraine-us-mineral-deal-intl,US and Ukraine sign critical minerals deal after months of tense negotiations,2025-05-01 00:00:00,"The United States and Ukraine have signed an “economic partnership agreement” that will give Washington access to Kyiv’s mineral resources in exchange for establishing an investment fund in Ukraine.
The US and Ukraine have been trying to hammer out the natural resources deal since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.
Compared to earlier drafts, the final agreement is reportedly less lopsided in favor of the US and is not as far-reaching. It stipulates that future American military assistance to Ukraine will count as part of the US investment into the fund, rather than calling for reimbursement for past assistance.
The deal comes after weeks of intense negotiations that at times turned bitter and temporarily derailed Washington’s aid to Ukraine.
Speaking Wednesday in a call with NewsNation, Trump said he made the deal to “protect” Washington’s contribution to the Ukrainian war effort. “We made a deal today where we get, you know, much more in theory, than the $350 billion but I wanted to be protected,” Trump said. “I didn’t want to be out there and look foolish.”
Trump has falsely claimed that the US has given Ukraine $350 billion since Russia fully invaded its neighbor in February 2022. The actual figure is around $120 billion, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
The US president said he told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky during their weekend meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral that “it’s a very good thing” if he signed the deal because “Russia is much bigger and much stronger.”
Among the terms of the agreement are “full ownership and control” of the resources staying with Ukraine, according to Kyiv’s Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who went to Washington to sign on behalf of the Ukrainian government.
“All resources on our territory and in territorial waters belong to Ukraine,” she said, adding: “It is the Ukrainian state that determines what and where to extract. Subsoil remains under Ukrainian ownership – this is clearly established in the Agreement.”
The signing comes hours after a last-minute disagreement over which documents to sign Wednesday threatened to derail the deal.
The details of the agreement have not been made public. However, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sunday that the deal “will not include assistance provided before its signing.”
“It is truly an equal and beneficial international agreement on joint investments in the development and recovery of Ukraine between the US and Ukrainian governments,” Shmyhal added.
Meanwhile, the tone of the US Treasury Department’s announcement of the deal showed more solidarity with Ukraine than previous statements from the Trump administration, referring to the war as “Russia’s full-scale invasion” of Ukraine.
“As the President has said, the United States is committed to helping facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement, calling it a “historic economic partnership.”
“This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” Bessent added. “And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.”
Bessent said the US looks “forward to quickly operationalizing” the agreement, but it’s not clear how swiftly new mining projects and collaborations can be launched as the war rages on.
Previous sticking points
Zelensky was expected to strike the deal during his trip to Washington in February – but the agreement was left unsigned when that visit was cut short following a contentious Oval Office meeting.
Among the key sticking point of the negotiations was the question of security guarantees – and whether the US would provide them as part of the deal. Trump initially refused that, saying he wants Ukraine to sign the agreement first and talk about guarantees later.
At that time, Zelensky described the draft agreement as asking him to “sell” his country. Ukrainian officials have since indicated they believed that US investment and the presence of American companies in Ukraine will make the US more interested in Ukraine’s security.
Shortly after the doomed White House visit, Trump ordered US aid to Ukraine to be suspended. While the assistance has since been restored, the episode became a major wakeup call for Ukraine’s European allies, who have pledged to step up their help to the country.
Trump had previously billed the agreement as Ukraine “paying back” for the aid the US has provided to Ukraine since Russia launched its unprovoked full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.
Speaking to Fox News Wednesday, Bessent said the deal is “a signal to the American people, that we have a chance to participate, get some of the funding and the weapons, compensation for those.”
Under the deal, the US and Ukraine will create a joint investment fund in Ukraine with an equal contributions from both and equal distribution of management shares between them, Ukrainian Prime Minister Shmyhal said.
“The American side may also count new, I emphasize new, military aid to Ukraine as a contribution to this fund,” Shmyhal added.
Mineral riches
Kyiv’s allies have long eyed Ukraine’s mineral riches. The country has deposits of 22 of the 50 materials classed as critical by the US Geological Survey.
These include rare earth minerals and other materials that are critical to the production of electronics, clean energy technologies and some weapon systems.
The global production of rare earth minerals and other strategically important materials has long been dominated by China, leaving Western countries desperate for other alternative sources – including Ukraine.
A memorandum of understanding prepared under the Biden administration last year said the US would promote investment opportunities in Ukraine’s mining projects to American companies in exchange for Kyiv creating economic incentives and implementing good business and environmental practices.
Ukraine already has a similar agreement with the European Union, signed in 2021.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/30/europe/ukrainian-journalist-russia-torture-intl/index.html,Victoria Roshchyna: Body of Ukrainian journalist who died in Russian detention returned by Moscow with signs of torture,2025-04-30 13:31:28,"The body of a young Ukrainian woman who died in Russian captivity after being held incommunicado for months was returned to Ukraine showing signs of torture, Ukrainian prosecutors have said.
Kyiv said the remains of journalist Victoria Roshchyna, who went missing during a reporting trip, were returned as part of a body exchange between Ukraine and Russia in February.
Yuriy Belousov, who heads the war crimes department at the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office, said that forensic examination found “numerous signs of torture and ill-treatment… including abrasions and hemorrhages on various parts of the body, a broken rib and possible traces of electric shock.”
He said the experts have determined the injuries were sustained while Roshchyna was still alive.
Russia is known to use electric shocks as a method of torture against detained Ukrainians, and the widespread nature of the practice was documented by CNN in the past.
Belousov said that repeated DNA analyses confirmed the body belonged to Roshchyna, even though it reportedly arrived from Russia labeled as “an unidentified male.” He said the state of the body made it impossible to determine the cause of Roshchyna’s death, but added that Ukraine was working with international forensic experts to get more answers.
Roshchyna’s colleagues at Ukrainska Pravda said her body was returned from Russia with missing organs. Citing members of the investigating team who handled her remains, they said the brain, eyeballs and part of the trachea, or windpipe, were missing, in what they said could have been an attempt by Russia to disguise the cause of death.
CNN has reached out to the Russian Federal Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova and to the Russian penitentiary services for comment.
Held in brutal detention center
Roshchyna went missing in August 2023. Her colleagues said the reporter went to a Russian-held part of Ukraine – a dangerous ordeal for any Ukrainian – to report on the lives of people living under occupation.
Journalist Evgeniya Motorevskaya, who worked with Roshchyna as the former editor of Hromadske, a Ukrainian media outlet, said the young reporter was determined to do her job as best as she could.
“For her, there was nothing more important than journalism. Vika was always where the most important events for the country took place. And she would have continued to do this for many years, but the Russians killed her,” she said in a statement published on Hromadske’s website when Roshchyna’s death was first announced, referring to her by her diminutive.
Roshchyna’s father first raised the alarm when she stopped responding to messages while on the assignment, but her family had no idea about her whereabouts until nine months later, when Moscow finally admitted it was holding her in detention.
Like thousands of other Ukrainian civilians, Roshchyna was snatched by Russian authorities in occupied Ukraine and deported into Russia where she was held without charge or trial.
By September 2024, Roshchyna, a healthy 27-year old, was dead – although her family didn’t find out until about a month later, when they received a notification from Russia.
Petro Yatsenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, said in October that Roshchyna died while being transferred from a detention facility in the southern Russian city of Taganrog to Moscow.
He said the transfer was in preparation for her release as part of a prisoner exchange.
The detention facility in Taganrog is known for its cruel treatment of detainees. CNN has previously spoken to prisoners held there, who described being subjected to physical and psychological abuse, being given insufficient amounts of food and denied access to basic health care.
Reporters with Ukrainska Pravda have partnered up with journalists from more than a dozen international media after her death was announced, to try to piece together what happened to her during the last few months of her life.
They interviewed dozens of prisoners, as well as prison guards and human rights defenders. They were able to trace her movements and describe the brutality of her detention.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina']",en

The suspect – Ignat Kuzin – allegedly purchased the car that exploded in Balashikha, less than 20 miles east of Moscow, according to TASS citing Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Russian Investigation Committee. The suspect’s nationality is unclear; according to the FSB, he has a residence permit in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) allegedly recruited Kuzin, who “confessed to the murder” of Russian General Yaroslav Moskalik, TASS reported. He was promised $18,000 for the attack, which had been planned since September 2024, added TASS.
The FSB had accused him of planting an explosive device in the car, but said that it was detonated from Ukraine. Video published by TASS on Saturday appeared to show charred electronics and parts of the car. Russia’s Investigative Committee previously said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel.
The suspect appeared in court on Sunday as a judge remanded him in custody for “one month and 30 days.” Footage from the court released by the Russian Investigative Committee showed Kuzin standing inside a defendant’s cage, wearing a black hoodie and face mask, when the judge issued the order. He was sent to a pretrial detention center in the capital.
Russian General Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. The influential Russian military blog Rybar said Moskalik was not in the Volkswagen car when it exploded but was close to it after walking out of a nearby building. CNN cannot independently verify this report.
Photos released by Russian authorities appear to show the suspect driving a dark green Volkswagen with license plates that match those purportedly found at the site of the blast.
TASS video also showed the man being put into a van, and included footage of him apparently in custody describing his alleged recruitment by Ukraine’s special services. It’s unclear if he was under duress during the confession.
No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion. CNN has reached out to the SBU and the country’s Foreign Ministry for comment on the case.
Moskalik was killed on the same day US special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin to discuss efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine.
After the three-hour meeting, US President Donald Trump initially voiced optimism that both sides were “very close to a deal.”
But the next day, Trump questioned whether Putin wants a peace deal shortly after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican for Pope Francis’ funeral.
In a Truth Social post sent as he returned from Rome after the meeting, Trump raised the prospect of apply ing new sanctions on Russia after its assault on Kyiv last week.
“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’ Too many people are dying!!!”","['Victoria Butenko', 'Michael Rios']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/26/europe/russia-regains-kursk-claim-intl/index.html,Russia claims recapture of Kursk border region but Ukraine says fighting continues,2025-04-26 10:51:37,"Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed his country’s forces have recaptured Kursk, the border region where Ukraine launched a surprise offensive last year, though Kyiv insists its troops are fiercely battling to preserve their foothold in the territory.
“The Kyiv regime’s adventure has completely failed,” Putin said Saturday, congratulating the Russian forces that he said defeated the Ukrainian military in the region. If confirmed, the capture would be a symbolic boost for the Kremlin at a crucial point in the war, with the US expressing growing impatience with the Russian leader for stalling on peace talks.
Senior Ukrainian military officials have disputed Putin’s claims, warning Moscow had not yet regained control of those battlegrounds – and that Kyiv’s soldiers maintained a heavy presence in the region.
“Russia has not yet liberated the Kursk region by 100%,” Oleh Shyriaiev, an army commander, said in a voice message on Sunday. He told CNN that Russian forces “are pressing” and “trying to counter-attack.”
“We are working, fighting,” he added. “These are not territorial successes… But successes in destroying enemy armoured vehicles and personnel.”
By midday on Sunday, Russia launched almost 70 attacks on Ukrainian positions, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing the country’s commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.
CNN is unable to independently verify battlefield reports but both sides have been struggling to make gains elsewhere on the frontlines.
Shyriaiev’s 225th regiment was among the first units to have entered Kursk in August – when Ukraine launched its shock incursion, swiftly capturing territory in what was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II.
Since then, Russia, with support from North Korean soldiers, has been fighting to oust Ukraine’s forces from its borders, while Kyiv had poured precious resources into holding onto its territory there, with the view of using it as a key bargaining chip in any peace talks. The operation was also launched to relieve pressure from the embattled eastern frontline.
In his address, Putin said recapturing Kursk “creates conditions for further successful actions of our troops in other important areas of the front.”
In a post on Telegram, Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, thanked the North Korean soldiers, praising their “high professionalism, steadfastness, courage and heroism in battle.”
Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports found that about 12,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to fight in Russia.
Local authorities are working to restore “peaceful life” in Kursk, Gerasimov said, as the region is demined and unexploded ordnance is destroyed. Forest areas, basements and abandoned buildings are being checked for any remaining Ukrainian soldiers, he added.
Kyiv mounts calls for ‘full and unconditional’ ceasefire
Zelensky reiterated calls for a “full and unconditional” ceasefire after a series of war talks held among Ukrainian, US and Russian leaders in recent days – as tensions between the three countries thwarted efforts to achieve an agreement.
“Ukraine continues to defend its independence and its land in battles,” Zelensky said on Sunday, following a briefing with a senior military aide about the battleground in Kursk.
“The situation on the frontline and the real activity of the Russian army prove that the current global pressure on Russia is insufficient to bring this war to an end,” he added.
If Putin’s claims are true, hopes of using Kursk as a bargaining counter are now gone. Ukraine’s retreat also has the potential to dent Kyiv’s political clout as well as its military’s morale after three years of war, with intense efforts underway towards finding peace.
The coming week will be “very critical” in determining whether the US can attempt to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, according to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio – suggesting President Donald Trump’s deadline for reaching a deal was swiftly approaching.
“This week is going to be a really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in, or if it’s time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally, if not more, important,” Rubio said on NBC.
“There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic,” he added. “We’re close, but we’re not close enough.”
Rubio’s tempered remarks followed a whirlwind week of diplomacy that saw Trump accuse Zelensky of making it “so difficult to settle this war” for refusing to accept Russia’s annexation of Crimea but later saying Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal.”
On Saturday morning, at the funeral of the late Pope Francis in the Vatican, Zelensky briefly met with Trump for talks on potential peace negotiations. A White House spokesperson called the meeting “productive,” while Zelensky thanked Trump for the meeting, writing on X that it “has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.”
A few hours later on Saturday afternoon, Trump raised the prospect of applying new sanctions on Russia for launching a deadly wave of attacks on Kyiv last week.
“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.
“It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’ Too many people are dying!!!”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/27/europe/russian-military-motorbikes-ukraine-drones-intl/index.html,Russian military turns to motorbikes to evade Ukrainian drones on frontlines,2025-04-27 14:48:50,"The Russian military is planning to increase the use of small squads on motorcycles and quadbikes on the frontlines in Ukraine as it plans fresh offensives, according to the Ukrainian military and analysts of the conflict.
The Russian Defense Ministry published video on Saturday showing units practising tactics in groups of two or three motorbikes, with a rider seen navigating a course to the sound of a pulsating electronic soundtrack.
Russian forces have used motorbikes and quads in several areas of the frontlines in an effort to evade Ukrainian drones for more than a year. But the Institute for the Study of War in Washington says the latest Russian video “indicates that the Russian military is likely developing a tactical doctrine for systematic offensive motorcycle usage and may be preparing to issue an increased number of motorcycles.”
Ukraine expects a major Russian offensive in the next few months as Moscow tries to capture more territory before any ceasefire agreement.
The Ukrainian military calls the motorbike assaults ‘banzai attacks.’ One Ukrainian commander, Andriy Otchenash, said earlier this month that the motorcycles are designed for a quick blitzkrieg. “They can advance very quickly, get behind the lines,” he said, but losses on the Russian side were very high.
“It indicates that the enemy does not have a large amount of military offensive equipment, but on the other hand, it is an adaptation to the conditions of war,” said the Ukrainian Center for Strategic Communication.
On Saturday, the Ukrainian military said it had repelled a Russian assault on the village of Bahatyr on the Donetsk frontlines, destroying 15 motorcycles and killing about 40 Russian soldiers. It distributed video of drones eliminating a number of motorbikes in open countryside.
The Ukrainian military reported in February the Russians were using more quadbikes around Chasiv Yar, also in Donetsk, where the frontlines have barely moved over the past year.
One Ukrainian military spokesman, Lt. Col. Pavlo Shamshyn, said the use of motorbikes was a mixed blessing for Russian troops. Their speed and manoeuvrability helped them to evade Ukrainian drones, but the noise of a bike prevented riders from hearing drones.
Russian state media has been promoting the advantages of motorbike units. Russia Today reported last week that motorcyclists were planting mines and interviewed a soldier with the 39th Guards Motorised Rifle Brigade, who is part of a new motorised group.
“Our main advantage is that we can drive directly into [the enemy’s position] and neutralise everyone,” he said. The enemy “hear the roar of the motorcycles, and it causes panic among them. They simply abandon their positions and run away.”
The Russian military is also using motorbikes to evacuate the wounded. The Telegram account of the Defense Ministry’s publication Zvezda reported last week that Russian marines fighting in the Kursk region were using all-terrain motorcycles to evacuate civilians and wounded soldiers. Video showed a soldier being put on the back of a bike in muddy fields.
Last year, the UK’s Defense Ministry said the Russians were increasingly using off-road bikes and all-terrain vehicles for night-time attacks. But it noted that Ukrainian FPV drones, which fly into their target, had already demonstrated how vulnerable such unprotected vehicles were.
Late in 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin inspected Chinese-made all-terrain vehicles being procured for the Russian army. At that point some 500 were already in service, and the Defense Ministry ordered around 1,500 more.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/26/europe/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-history-analysis/index.html,Analysis: Trump has learned that getting through to Putin isn’t easy,2025-04-17 00:00:00,"US President Donald Trump is finding out that getting through to Russian President Vladimir Putin is not as easy as he might have thought. But he’s only the latest US leader to fail at an attempt to get Russia and its longtime president on board.
The Trump administration’s attempts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine have largely stalled, despite a flurry of diplomatic activity.
Since returning to the White House, Trump has held at least two lengthy phone calls with Putin and has repeatedly sent his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet the Russian leader in person in Moscow, with the latest trip on Friday.
Unsurprisingly to many Kremlin-watchers, none of these meetings have led to an agreement. Not only did Witkoff come back empty-handed, he also repeated several key Kremlin talking points.
The latest US proposal includes recognizing Russian control of Crimea – a long-standing red line for Ukraine and its European allies, officials familiar with the details have told CNN.
“I would say the negotiations are going very well — from Putin’s point of view,” Angela Stent, a foreign policy expert and former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, told CNN.
“He has no intention of stopping the war, but what he wants, and what he’s getting, is a restoration of US-Russian diplomatic relations.”
“Putin is playing a waiting game because he believes that time is on his side and that he can force Ukraine into a more disadvantageous position and persuade Kyiv and its European allies with the help of Washington that there is no alternative to a peace settlement on Russian terms,” John Lough, the head of foreign policy at New Eurasian Strategies Centre, a think tank based in London and Washington, told CNN.
Stalling, haggling over every detail, or saying no without explicitly saying “no” is a classic Russian tactic, employed by Putin and his top negotiators on several occasions in the past, such as during the negotiations for a ceasefire in Syria.
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration didn’t see it coming because it doesn’t have the expertise that would have led it to expect such behavior, or if it has simply decided to play along.
Trump’s words since coming back into office indicate that he sees the world in a similar way to Putin, Stent said – as consisting of a handful of great powers to whom smaller countries should submit.
“Trump talks about great power competition (between China and the US), that he should be able to take over Canada and Greenland, and Panama, and from Putin’s point of view, that’s okay. Remember, he hasn’t criticized Trump for any of these things,” she said.
Ultimately, Trump has made it clear that he has little interest in the future of Ukraine – even suggesting Ukraine “might be Russia someday.”
So, if Putin continues to drag the process along, it may give Trump a way out.
Putin’s ‘art of manipulating’
Lough said that Putin’s KGB training has shaped the way he approaches negotiations.
“Putin famously described his job in the KGB as ‘work with people.’ He was trained in the art of manipulating interlocutors. He is known to prepare meticulously for negotiations and is a master of detail,” Lough told CNN, adding that the Russian leader is known to be “quick on his feet and can charm and intimidate in the same breath.”
Putin has employed this technique on Trump in the past, according to Kalina Zhekova, an associate professor at University College London (UCL) who specializes in Russian foreign policy.
When the two met in Helsinki in 2018, the Russian leader handed Trump a ball from the 2018 World Cup during the news conference, saying “now the ball is in your court,” in reference to efforts to improve the strained US-Russia relationship.
“This was indicative of Putin’s calculated ‘tit-for-tat’ approach that views diplomacy as a game with winners and losers. He was also likely aware that his counterpart is someone with a fragile ego who is easily impressed by theatrical gestures and gifts,” Zhekova said, adding that the summit was widely seen as a win for Putin, because Trump was reluctant to denounce Moscow’s interference in the 2016 US presidential election, contradicting US intelligence reports and effectively siding with the Kremlin.
Putin has many tricks in his diplomatic toolbox. He likes to keep his counterparts waiting by turning up late for meetings – sometimes by several hours. He often creates chaotic situations to get more options and can change his mind when it suits him, which makes it even more difficult to negotiate with him.
He is also known to use other ways to assert his power. In 2007, for example, “Putin allowed his Labrador to approach (German Chancellor) Merkel during a photo opportunity, although her fear of dogs was communicated to Russian officials prior to the meeting,” Zhekova said.
Witkoff, a real estate magnate with zero previous experience in politics or diplomacy, has been trying to strike a deal with a former KGB lieutenant colonel who has outlasted five US presidents, eight UK prime ministers, three Chinese leaders and six NATO chiefs, having personally negotiated with many of them.
Stent pointed to the fact that Gen. Keith Kellogg, officially Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has been largely sidelined in the talks with Russia, despite, she said, having the most relevant experience. “Of course, he’s a general, he’s not a diplomat, but at least he has some experience with Russia and thinking about these things, but of course, he’s only dealing with Ukraine.”
The mismatch in expertise extends beyond Witkoff to the rest of the US negotiating team too.
Instead of Kellogg, Witkoff was accompanied on some of his trips by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Both are experienced politicians but have no proven track record when it comes to Russia.
Meanwhile, the Russian delegation included longtime Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the former ambassador to Washington, Yuri Ushakov, and Kirill Dimitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund who studied at Stanford and Harvard. All three speak fluent English and are experienced diplomats who know how to deal with Americans.
US could ‘move on’ soon
Moscow might be dragging its feet in hopes that Trump will lose his patience and abandon his goal of ending the war.
Signs of that are already emerging: Rubio said last week that the US could walk away within “days” if there are no signs of progress. And CNN reported this week that Trump is getting frustrated with the lack of progress and privately told advisers that mediating a deal has been more difficult than he anticipated.
“(The Trump administration) are eager to have a deal, but unwilling to pay a high cost for that deal – so no US security guarantees, no boots on the ground (and) they’re unwilling to surge US aid to Ukraine as a stick to try to get Russia to make concessions,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, the director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a think tank that advocates for more restrained US foreign policy.
She added that, for Trump, getting the US out of Ukraine and stabilizing relations with Russia are more important than achieving peace.
Putin knows this. Russia’s launch of several major attacks against Ukraine over the past few weeks, including on Kyiv, indicates the Kremlin’s belief that the leverage US has – or is willing to use – is limited.
Trump, of course, is not the first US president to believe he can build a good relationship with Russia.
“Every US administration in my memory has come in with some idea that they’re going to reset – they all use that word – the relationship with Russia, that they have an opportunity to turn the page and start again. And they have always been wrong,” Sam Greene, director for Democratic Resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told CNN.
Greene, who is also a professor of Russian politics at King’s College London, said that this succession of failures has meant that Moscow “has come to see the United States as fundamentally inconsistent.”
Some former presidents tried to build personal relationships with Putin – George W. Bush invited the Russian leader to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where he drove him around in a Ford pickup truck. Bush famously wrote later that he “looked the man in the eye” and “was able to get a sense of his soul.”
But while Putin was initially agreeable to cooperating with the Bush administration, being the first world leader to call Bush after the 9/11 attacks, their relationship soured fairly quickly.
“I think the real reason for the collapse of that reset was because Putin wanted the United States to treat Russia as an equal and to recognize that it has a right to a sphere of influence in the post-Soviet states. And that’s not what the Bush administration was prepared to do,” Stent said.
Other US administrations have tried a different approach, attempting to get Russia more interested in cooperation by welcoming the country into global institutions – such as the G7 in 1997 during Bill Clinton’s presidency, or the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2012 under the Obama administration.
“And that hasn’t worked either, largely because both sides, over time, underestimated the depth of the structural disconnect between the West and where Russia was headed,” Greene said.
America’s relationship with Russia did somewhat ease under the Obama administration – but mostly because Putin wasn’t officially in the top seat for some of that time. He stepped down in 2008 to become prime minister because of term limits. He returned as president in 2012 and has since changed the constitution.
The key problem, experts say, is that the US and Russia simply do not understand each other – now or in decades past.
“I don’t think that most US administrations have understood really the depth of Russia’s shift towards not just authoritarianism, but to a brand of authoritarianism that sees the existence of Western power and particularly sort of the unity of the transatlantic relationship as deeply threatening to Russia’s interests,” Greene said.
Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who was the senior director for Russia on the National Security Council staff from 2004 to 2007, said that the key mistake American presidents made after the breakup of the Soviet Union was thinking that it was possible to develop a broad strategic partnership with Russia.
“I would argue that given Russian interest, given Russian history and Russian traditions, that was never really on the cards. And so we tended to exaggerate the possibilities for cooperation, and then were deeply disappointed when we didn’t get it,” he told CNN.
Graham, who served as a special assistant to Bush, said that the only way forward is to understand that Russia and the US will always have a complex, competitive relationship.
“It’s important to remember that there are different ways of rivalry. We could have the type of very profound adversarial relationship that we have at this point, with, I would say, an unacceptably high risk of military confrontation between Russia and the United States … or we could have something that I like to call competitive coexistence, where the competition is largely in an economic, commercial, cultural, ideological, diplomatic realm, and not so much in the military realm,” he said.
The point, Graham and others say, is that Russia will not disappear. It will continue to exist and have an interest in European security, in Ukraine and in competing with the Western world.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
Russia’s war on Ukraine may be entering a pivotal moment.
President Donald Trump, who CNN reported Friday has been surprised and frustrated at the difficulty of achieving his promise of ending the war, wants Ukraine to give up territory in exchange for peace and essentially cede control of Crimea, the peninsula Russia first invaded in 2014.
Russia controls nearly 20% of Ukraine, much of which could be lost under the current US proposal.
The US is considering recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, even though its seizure was against international law.
All Russian President Vladimir Putin has to do, in Trump’s thinking, is stop fighting, leaving Putin richly rewarded for invading Ukraine if he is able to officially keep so much territory. If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky won’t budge, the US has threatened to withdraw support for Ukraine.
What’s been happening?
Trump’s top emissary, Steve Witkoff, met in person with Putin Friday in Moscow.
Ukrainians have been in talks with Americans and Europeans in London, pursuing their version of a plan, in which a ceasefire would come before any discussion of ceding territory.
Trump and Zelensky will both be at the Pope’s funeral in Rome over the weekend.
Whether there will be a breakthrough for peace, the entire two-tracked process blows up, or inertia sets in and the war continues could become clear in the coming days.
Meanwhile, hostilities continue. A Russian general was killed in a car bomb near Moscow Friday. Russian strikes are still targeting Ukraine’s cities, despite Trump’s admonition to Putin on social media, “Vladimir STOP.”
Will Ukraine give up on Crimea?
Trump thinks so.
“Crimea will stay with Russia,” he told Time on April 22. “And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time,” Trump said.
Russia first invaded Crimea in 2014 but despite moral outrage and sanctions, it did not face other consequences like it did later when it tried to invade the rest of Ukraine in 2022. Trump’s proposal for a cease fire seems to start with the idea that Crimea will be controlled by Russia.
Zelensky has publicly rejected the idea of ceding Crimea.
But other key Ukrainians seem to be open to the idea. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former champion boxer, told the BBC he is not involved in negotiations but that giving up Crimea might be necessary.
“It’s not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary,” Klitschko said.
Would a Crimea concession lead to a peace plan?
Washington Post columnist David Ignatius argues that if the two sides can get past the Crimea issue, other details could be worked out, including whether European troops will backstop Ukraine’s security, and whether the US will have a presence, perhaps securing and running a nuclear power plant.
CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh isn’t so sure, in large part because it’s not at all clear what Trump wants from Putin and whether Putin will give anything up. He writes:
The overriding problem is Putin thinks time is on his side and Trump has repeatedly said the clock is ticking. These two contrasting positions will not yield a lasting deal. The Kremlin has perhaps wisely ascertained it can, over months, hive off tiny concessions from the White House, and slowly build a geopolitical picture that is more in its favour. Consider the first 90 days of Trump’s presidency and how far the world has already changed in Moscow’s favour.
What’s wrong with the US recognizing Crimea as part of Russia?
Russia violated international law by invading Crimea, as CNN’s Ivana Kottosová writes. Zelensky has so far rejected the idea of ceding Crimea, noting that to do so would violate Ukraine’s Constitution.
If the US were to recognize Crimea as Russian, it would break America’s word multiple times over.
From Kottosová’s report:
Recognizing Crimea as part of Russia would put the Trump administration in breach of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the US made a commitment to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders, in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons.
In 2018, during the first Trump administration, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement reaffirming the US’ refusal to recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sovereignty over Crimea.
What does it mean if Putin is able to keep Crimea?
“That means that he has basically upended the international order,” retired Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, said on CNN Friday. “In essence, what he’s done is created a situation where we go back to the 19th century, where might makes right, and that is what he wants,” Leighton said, comparing Putin’s actions to the invasion by Nazi Germany of Czechoslovakia in the 1930s.
Ukrainians feel Crimea has been part of their country since the fall of the Soviet Union. In the decade-plus since Russia seized it Putin has worked to “Russify” Crimea. There are also resource considerations since Crimea and other contested portions of Ukraine are rich in oil, natural gas and other resources. Finally, Crimea sits on the Black Sea and offers important strategic advantages to Russia.
What if Zelensky won’t budge and the US, as it has threatened, walks away?
“What ‘walk away’ means is still a question that no one has really clear insight to,” according to Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former US Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia.
“Does it just mean that the United States will no longer be engaged in the diplomatic process in trying to end the war? Or does it mean that the United States will actually pack up and go home entirely, including ending any remaining military aid?” she told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on CNN Max.
Would Ukraine still fight without US support?
Ukraine does rely on US support, particularly for air defenses and for intelligence. But it has also built up its own resources and leans on Europe.
“Ukrainians will not stop fighting if the United States packs up its bags and walks away,” Kendall-Taylor said.
It’s Ukrainian drones that are causing most of the casualties on Russian soldiers at this point, she said. Ukrainians are also producing longer-range drones that can strike within Russia, which means Ukraine may prefer to play for time to “convince Putin that he can’t stay in this conflict indefinitely.”
Does Putin have any incentive to end the war?
“Not a lot,” according to Kendall-Taylor. “And that’s exactly why we’ve seen such intransigence on his part in making any progress towards the war.”
“It’s really in his interest to continue with the foot dragging, to try to demonstrate that they (Russia) are playing along so that they can preserve the US-Russia relationship,” she said.
“(Putin’s) preferred outcome would be to preserve that relationship and get the United States to abandon Ukraine,” she said.
Will Europe fill a US void?
Michael Kimmage, a former State Department specialist on Russia and Ukraine who now directs the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center told me that it already seems unlikely the US Congress will approve more spending to help Ukraine and that Europe, particularly Germany, is moving to step into that void.
“This is profound,” he said of Germany’s pivot to prioritize security in its spending.
“In a way, Trump is radicalizing German foreign policy, and there’s a need to go as fast as possible in the direction of independence (from the US), he said.
“If Germany is going to spend a trillion dollars on defense in the next couple of years, a lot of that is going to go to go to Ukraine, or it’s going to be a backstop to supporting Ukraine.”
But that’s a pivot that will take time.
“It’s not as if the Germany can fill in on the in the short term for the United States, but it can balance out the erratic and basically anti-Ukraine nature of the Trump presidency,” he said.",['Zachary B. Wolf'],en

“A good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine. They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off,’” Trump wrote on Truth Social after landing in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis.
Kyiv and Moscow have not met directly since the early weeks of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbor. Any direct talks would likely require further discussion and add delay to the diplomacy the Trump White House has hoped will yield results in a matter of days.
Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff spent three hours meeting with Putin at the Kremlin on Friday, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters after the meeting, adding that the talks were “constructive and very useful.”
Witkoff’s trip to Russia, his fourth since Trump returned to the White House in January, came at a crunch time. The US president’s self-imposed deadline to end the war within his administration’s first 100 days is nearing.
“This conversation allowed the Russian and US positions to be further brought closer together, not only on Ukraine, but also on a number of other international issues,” Ushakov told reporters in a call.
Ushakov, a former Russian ambassador to Washington, was part of the meeting with Putin, as was Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, Russian state news agency Tass said.
CNN reported earlier Friday that two diverging visions of a peace deal are at the heart of recent negotiations: one supported by Ukraine and its European allies, and another backed by the Trump administration.
A European official familiar with the different drafts said the Ukrainian and European proposal envisaged a ceasefire followed by discussions about territory, with Kyiv receiving defense guarantees from its allies along the lines of those found in NATO’s Article 5.
Witkoff’s version proposed the recognition of Crimea as Russian by the United States, “robust security guarantees” for Ukraine, Kyiv not joining NATO and sanctions against Russia being lifted, the official said.
Recognizing Russian control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, would cross a major red line for Ukraine and its European allies, and would be in breach of established international law.
It would also reverse around a decade of US foreign policy.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the idea, saying there was “nothing to talk about” as such a recognition would be against Ukraine’s constitution.
The United States has been applying more pressure on Ukraine after threatening last week it could walk away from the talks “within days” if it becomes clear a deal cannot be reached.
Opposing visions of peace
According to Ushakov, part of the discussion considered direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow.
“As for the Ukrainian crisis itself, the discussion was, in particular, about the possibility of resuming negotiations between representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine,” he said.
Witkoff and Putin likely also discussed an amended peace proposal which Zelensky said emerged from a week of diplomatic wrangling. Zelensky said President Donald Trump had received on his desk a fresh document proposing a path forward in negotiations more amenable to Ukraine and its European allies.
Vice President JD Vance earlier on Wednesday called “to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today.”
Asked what concessions Russia was offering on Thursday, Trump replied, “stopping the war,” suggesting that not “taking the whole country” is a “pretty big concession.”
CNN reported this week that Trump was getting frustrated with the stalling talks and has privately told advisers that mediating a deal has been more difficult than he anticipated.
At a briefing on Friday in Kyiv, Zelensky conceded that Ukraine lacks the military might needed to retake Crimea by force, but urged the international community to maintain pressure on Russia.
Series of targeted bomb attacks
Friday’s highly anticipated meeting in Moscow took place soon after the announcement that General Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, had been killed when a car exploded in Balashikha, which lies less than 20 miles east of the capital.
Russia’s Investigative Committee confirmed Moskalik’s death, adding that the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel.
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing. The attack appeared similar in nature to previous assassinations of Russian officials, including that of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, a top Russian general who was accused of orchestrating the use of chemical weapons on the battlefields in Ukraine.
Kirillov – who headed Russia’s radiological, biological and chemical protection forces – was killed in December, after a remotely operated bomb planted inside an electric scooter went off outside an apartment building in Moscow.
CNN has reached out to Ukrainian authorities for comment.
The influential Russian military blog Rybar said Moskalik was not in the Volkswagen Golf when it exploded but was close to it after walking out of a nearby building. CNN cannot independently verify this report.
Little is known about Moskalik, who held the rank of lieutenant general.
Rybar described him as “competent and demanding” and said “he was not well liked” because he was “tough on his subordinates.”
Russia’s Investigative Committee said it has opened a criminal probe into the explosion. It added that an investigative team, including forensic experts and law enforcement officers, had begun examining the scene.
Tass earlier reported that the explosive device was “homemade.”
Friday’s reported blast comes two days after a fire broke out at an underground car park in Moscow’s business district following an explosion there.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Sophie Tanno', 'Nick Paton Walsh']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war/index.html,Fact check: It wasn’t ‘in jest.’ Here are 53 times Trump said he’d end Ukraine war within 24 hours or before taking office,2025-04-25 21:07:43,"He wasn’t joking.
When President Donald Trump was reminded in an interview with Time magazine this week that he had said he would end the Russian war on Ukraine on “day one,” he claimed he hadn’t been speaking literally or seriously.
“Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended,” Trump said, according to Time’s transcript.
This “in jest” claim is a lie.
On the campaign trail in 2023 and 2024, Trump said on dozens of occasions, in an entirely serious tone, manner and context, that he would end the war in Ukraine either within 24 hours of his return to the White House or even sooner than that. He said over and over again, including at both presidential debates of 2024, that he would have the war “settled” when he was president-elect, before his inauguration.
A Friday search of the Roll Call Factba.se database that catalogues Trump’s public remarks turned up at least 53 examples of Trump making such comments.
It’s sometimes hard to determine the intent of a politician’s one-time ad-libs, but this was no jovial ad-lib. Rather, the promise of a rapid end to the war was a sober staple of Trump’s pre-written rally remarks. He framed the promise as a key component of his second-term agenda, and he justified it with claims about his “credibility” as a leader, his history as a “peacemaker,” and his knowledge of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump sometimes emphasized that he was speaking literally, scoffing at critics who said he couldn’t end the war that fast. “I’ll get that done within 24 hours. Everyone says, ‘Oh, no, you can’t.’ Absolutely I can. Absolutely I can,” he said at one July 2023 rally in Iowa. He said at a Pennsylvania rally later that month: “Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we all together win the presidency, we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled. The war is going to be settled. I’ll get them both – I know Zelensky, I know Putin, it’ll be done within 24 hours, you watch. They all say, ‘That’s such a boast.’ It will be done very quickly.”
Here are the 53 examples. There might well be more; this isn’t intended as an exhaustive list.
March 4, 2023. Speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.
“Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled quickly. Quickly. I will get the problem solved and I will get it solved in rapid order and it will take me no longer than one day. I know exactly what to say to each of them.”
March 25, 2023. Rally in Waco, Texas.
“And before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled.” And: “So when I say ‘end it,’ I’m going to get a settlement very quickly. And I know both people, and you can get it very, very quickly. You can only do it through the presidency, but you control the money coming in, coming out. You can get that. I will have that settlement done within 24 hours.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war/index.html,Fact check: It wasn’t ‘in jest.’ Here are 53 times Trump said he’d end Ukraine war within 24 hours or before taking office,2025-04-25 21:07:43,"He wasn’t joking.
When President Donald Trump was reminded in an interview with Time magazine this week that he had said he would end the Russian war on Ukraine on “day one,” he claimed he hadn’t been speaking literally or seriously.
“Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended,” Trump said, according to Time’s transcript.
This “in jest” claim is a lie.
On the campaign trail in 2023 and 2024, Trump said on dozens of occasions, in an entirely serious tone, manner and context, that he would end the war in Ukraine either within 24 hours of his return to the White House or even sooner than that. He said over and over again, including at both presidential debates of 2024, that he would have the war “settled” when he was president-elect, before his inauguration.
A Friday search of the Roll Call Factba.se database that catalogues Trump’s public remarks turned up at least 53 examples of Trump making such comments.
It’s sometimes hard to determine the intent of a politician’s one-time ad-libs, but this was no jovial ad-lib. Rather, the promise of a rapid end to the war was a sober staple of Trump’s pre-written rally remarks. He framed the promise as a key component of his second-term agenda, and he justified it with claims about his “credibility” as a leader, his history as a “peacemaker,” and his knowledge of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump sometimes emphasized that he was speaking literally, scoffing at critics who said he couldn’t end the war that fast. “I’ll get that done within 24 hours. Everyone says, ‘Oh, no, you can’t.’ Absolutely I can. Absolutely I can,” he said at one July 2023 rally in Iowa. He said at a Pennsylvania rally later that month: “Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we all together win the presidency, we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled. The war is going to be settled. I’ll get them both – I know Zelensky, I know Putin, it’ll be done within 24 hours, you watch. They all say, ‘That’s such a boast.’ It will be done very quickly.”
Here are the 53 examples. There might well be more; this isn’t intended as an exhaustive list.

At least eight people were killed in drone strikes across the country, a night after Russia launched its deadliest bombardment of the Ukrainian capital since the middle of last year.
A drone attack on the eastern city of Pavlohrad on Friday killed three people, including a 76-year-old woman and a child, and injured 10 others, Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said.
In southern Ukraine, two people were also killed in strikes on Kherson, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said, adding the strikes targeted critical infrastructure and residential buildings. Two more people died in attacks on Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, and one person was killed in Kharkiv in the northeast of the country, regional leaders said.
Ukraine’s capital Kyiv was the main target of Russia’s massive bombardment on Thursday, which hit several locations across the city, killing 12 people and wounding 87 others. Ukraine’s emergency services said on Friday that it had completed the search for survivors in the rubble of one residential block, hit by what Ukrainian authorities said was a North Korean ballistic missile.
The fresh round of attacks come after President Trump vented his frustration over the lack of progress on a peace deal on Thursday, saying he is “not happy” and urging Putin to “STOP!” the attacks, in a post on his Truth Social platform. Hours later, however, Trump said he believed both Russia and Ukraine want peace.
On Friday, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to arrive in Moscow for further talks with Putin on reaching an agreement.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow was “ready to reach a deal,” in an interview with CBS News on Thursday, but added that there were still some specific points that needed to be “fine-tuned.”
Earlier this week, Trump launched a new tirade against Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of harming peace negotiations, after Zelensky said it was against his country’s constitution to recognize Russian control of Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.
Any move to recognize Russia’s control of Crimea would reverse a decade of US policy and could upset the widely held post-World War Two consensus that international borders should not be changed by force.
As part of its mission to seal a peace deal to end the three-year war, the US administration has proposed recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, a move which diplomatic sources have told CNN has highly alarmed US allies in Europe.
The spat over Crimea is the latest in a series of very public disagreements between Trump and Zelensky.
Trump has insisted he has been equally as tough on Putin, but got defensive on Thursday when asked by White House reporters what concessions Russia had made in the conflict.
“Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country. Pretty big concession,” Trump said.
“We’re putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and Russia knows that, and some people that are close to it know or he wouldn’t be talking right now.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/world/trump-ukraine-crimea-explainer-intl/index.html,Why Trump’s Crimea proposal would tear down a decades-old pillar of the global order,2025-04-25 12:39:54,"US President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine should recognize Russia’s control over Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed more than a decade ago, is threatening to upend international law and order.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has long made it clear this is a red line for him.
“There is nothing to talk about. It is against our constitution,” he told reporters on Tuesday.
Trump scolded Zelensky for that remark, accusing him of making it “so difficult to settle this war” and saying Crimea was “lost years ago.” It is a topic Trump revisited in an interview with Time magazine, saying as part of his proposal to end the war “Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time.”
This spat between the two presidents has put the region firmly back on the agenda. Here’s what we know.
Is this legal?
No. If the Trump administration was to somehow recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea, it would be breaching international law as well as multiple declarations and agreements made by the United States, including by the first Trump White House.
“In terms of international law, such a pronouncement would be null and void,” said Sergey Vasiliev, an international law expert and professor at the Open University in the Netherlands.
“That territorial acquisitions that result from the use of force shall not be recognized as legal is basically one of the bedrock principles of international law,” Vasiliev told CNN.
Recognizing Crimea as part of Russia would put the Trump administration in breach of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the US made a commitment to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders, in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons.
In 2018, during the first Trump administration, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement reaffirming the US’ refusal to recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sovereignty over Crimea.
Carla Ferstman, a law professor at Essex University and director of its Human Rights Centre, said that recognition of Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea by the US “could in principle provide some weight” to Moscow’s claim that the peninsula’s status was decided in a 2014 referendum that was condemned by Western powers as a sham.
“Far more likely, however, is that such a declaration creates a further rift between Europe and the US, and within NATO,” she said.
Recognizing Crimea as Russian would also be illegal under Ukraine’s constitution – which is one of the reasons why Zelensky said it was out of the question.
But Vasiliev said that even if Ukraine changed its constitution and signed some sort of agreement handing sovereignty of Crimea to Moscow, this could be considered invalid if Kyiv was coerced into it.
What would it mean in practice?
Since any recognition of Crimea as part of Russia would be in breach of international laws and norms, it is unlikely that other countries would follow in the US’ footsteps.
“Given the fluidity of US positions under the Trump administration, it is not clear that it would have any practical impact,” Ferstman said.
“If this manifested into a clear and permanent position of the US, then it would make it more difficult for the US to engage in collective efforts in support of Ukraine and would make the gulf between the US and other NATO partners more entrenched,” she added.
Why is Crimea so important to Ukraine?
Crimea has been part of independent Ukraine since the country split from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Roughly 2.5 million people lived in Crimea before its illegal annexation in 2014 and many more would regularly visit the tourist hotspot, known for its beaches and nature reserves.
Many other Ukrainians have emotional links to the peninsula.
How did Russia annex Crimea?
The crisis in Crimea started shortly after the 2014 mass protests in Ukraine that toppled the country’s Russian-backed regime of Viktor Yanukovych.
As the nation grappled with the chaos caused by the Maidan protests, Russian soldiers dressed as civilians or in uniform without identifying insignia – at the time referred to as “little green men” – started popping up outside government buildings and military bases across Crimea.
Russia has had a major naval base in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol for over 200 years. A dispute over that facility and the Black Sea fleet stationed there erupted between Kyiv and Moscow after the fall of the Soviet Union. The argument was later settled in a deal that saw Ukraine leasing the base to Russia in exchange for stable gas prices.
While Moscow denied any involvement in the appearance of the little green men in Crimea, it held a sham referendum on joining Russia just weeks after the covert operation. Putin would later acknowledge he had deployed Russian troops there.
Did Ukraine fight for Crimea?
In his latest tirade against Zelensky, Trump asked “why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?”
The truth is more complicated than Trump suggests.
The Russian operation took Ukraine – and much of the world – by surprise. Russia spent weeks covertly beefing up its military presence across the peninsula before taking control, overpowering the Ukrainians.
Moscow says Crimea was always Russian. Is that true?
No. Before the annexation, Crimea was part of independent Ukraine, known as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the only self-governing region within unitary Ukraine.
The peninsula voted for Ukrainian independence in a referendum in 1991. Before that, it was part of the Soviet Republic of Ukraine.
And while it’s true that Crimea was part of Russia for more than a century and a half – since it was annexed by Catherine the Great in 1783 until it was transferred to Ukraine in 1954 – this period is a relatively short blip in Crimea’s long written history, which dates back to 1,000 BC.
Over the course of the millennium, the peninsula was part of the Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires, it was invaded by Mongols and fought over by Venice and Genoa.
For some 300 years, Crimea was under the control of Crimean Tatars, who are recognized as the peninsula’s indigenous people. After the 18th-century Russian annexation, the Tatar population lived through more than two centuries of persecution and exodus.
What has happened since?
Russia has imposed an increasingly brutal and repressive regime on Crimea and its people over the past 11 years, human rights observers say.
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has repeatedly reported on the human rights violations allegedly committed by Russia in occupied Crimea – from unlawful detentions, to sexual abuse and torture, to forcing people to send their children to Russian schools and training programs.
Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses, despite substantial evidence and victim testimonies.
According to official data from the Ukrainian government, more than 64,000 have fled the peninsula to other parts of Ukraine since the annexation. However, Crimean NGOs estimate the number of refugees might be twice as high, as not everyone has officially registered with the government.
Meanwhile, Moscow has worked on its plan to “Russify” the peninsula. It put in place incentives to persuade Russian citizens to relocate to Crimea and the Ukrainian government estimated in 2023 that some 500,000 to 800,000 Russians had moved there permanently since it was annexed, with the number jumping sharply after the opening of the Kerch bridge that connects Crimea to Russia.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-efforts-language/index.html,Trump’s own strange and tepid wording illustrates his one-sided Ukraine peace plan,2025-04-25 04:00:50,"President Donald Trump’s intense pressure on Ukraine and deference to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is extinguishing any lingering notion that the United States is an evenhanded peace broker.
The US effort leans heavily toward Russia’s positions, even though Moscow started the war with its unprovoked invasion. This stems from Trump’s view of a war in which Kyiv “has no cards to play.”
The president forcibly denied on Thursday that he has a dog in the fight, saying he was simply motivated by a desire to end a war that has killed thousands of civilians.
“I have no allegiance to anybody. I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to save a lot of lives, a lot of young people’s — mostly young people,” the president said.
But the unbalanced nature of the US peace effort can be seen in Trump’s deliberately unspecific language about the conflict and the strange, even bizarre ways that he’s talking about the war.
‘Vladimir, STOP!’
Early Thursday morning, Russia shot 70 missiles and launched 145 drones toward Ukraine. Most raced to Kyiv in the most murderous attack on the capital in nine months. At least 12 people were killed and 90 were injured as casualties were trapped under the rubble of residential buildings. The capital’s terrified residents were forced back into their air raid shelters — some taking their small kids and pets with them.
Trump’s response to this resumption of terror? A tepid posting on his Truth Social account that seemed most concerned with when the attacks took place than with the carnage wreaked on defenseless civilians. “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP!” Trump wrote. “Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!”
The president expanded on his post during an Oval Office appearance later in the day.
“I didn’t like last night. I wasn’t happy with it, and we’re in the midst of talking peace, and missiles were fired, and I was not happy with it,” Trump said, noticeably using a passive tense and not blaming Putin directly.
Another US president might have offered condolences to the victims, pointed out that deliberately targeting civilians is a war crime and threatened consequences. But Trump’s response was consistent with his long practice of refusing to connect the results of horrific attacks with the leader who ordered them.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who blasted Putin as a “thug” and a “gangster” during his 2016 presidential campaign, was on the Oval Office sofa Thursday afternoon. He adopted Trump’s obfuscatory tenses in a way that almost implied Russian missiles ended up in Kyiv all by themselves. “What happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody why this war needs to end,” Rubio said. “It’s horrible, those missiles landed, but what’s even worse is there are … people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues.”
The administration’s limp language about Putin contrasted with the fierce dressing-down of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in that same Oval Office in March. Trump went after the Ukrainian president again this week after Zelensky ruled out recognizing Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
On Truth Social, Trump complained about “Inflammatory statements like Zelensky’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.”
The contrast in the president’s tone toward the two leaders is remarkable.
“When Zelensky dares to speak the truth, Trump truly slams him,” John Herbst, the former US ambassador to Ukraine told Paula Newton on CNN International. “When Putin murders civilians with ballistic missiles he’s merely corrected. Or slightly chastised.”
Russia’s big concession? Not taking all of Ukraine
Trump got defensive on Thursday, when he was asked what concessions Russia had made in the conflict, compared to his constant pressure on Ukraine.
“Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country. Pretty big concession,” Trump said.
This answer betrays a strange misunderstanding of what happened in the war and shows just how comprehensively Trump views the war through Putin’s lens.
The reason a Russian-backed president is not running Ukraine now is that the country’s armed forces performed a heroic rearguard action that shocked the world at the start of the war and saved the capital. And years of arms and ammunition transfers from the US and its European allies kept it that way.
“It is absolutely no concession,” Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on “The Brief.” “From my perspective at least, it is absolutely absurd to say something like that.”
Trump insisted that he’d been plenty tough on Putin — although there’s very little evidence that the Russian leader has paid any price for ignoring Trump’s ceasefire plans and for continuing attacks on civilians as peace talks drag on inconclusively.
“You don’t know what pressure I’m putting on Russia,” he told a reporter. “We’re putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and Russia knows that, and some people that are close to it know or he wouldn’t be talking right now.”
Sources familiar with the peace discussions told CNN on Thursday that Trump is privately frustrated with his failure to broker an end to the war. But so far, his impatience hasn’t prompted any efforts to coerce Russia into accepting exceedingly generous terms. Trump could, for instance, rush arms to Ukraine to increase the price of the war for Russia’s forces. He could send Patriot anti-missile systems to Kyiv or provide defense against ballistic missiles. The president could also impose secondary sanctions on nations that continue to buy Russian oil and bankroll its war effort.
But he’s done none of that. And his uneven approach threatens to further punish the war’s victim.",['Stephen Collinson'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/politics/trump-ukraine-war-frustration/index.html,A frustrated Trump privately concedes ending the Ukraine war has been harder than he thought,2025-04-24 22:43:29,"Five days before his 100th day in office – and 93 days since his own deadline passed for resolving the conflict in Ukraine – President Donald Trump is frustrated his efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine have so far fallen short, and has privately told advisers that mediating a deal has been more difficult than he anticipated, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.
Behind the scenes, he frequently brings up how much Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hate one another, one of the sources said – an unsurprising fact, but one the president argues further complicates negotiations.
On Thursday, his agitation boiled over as Russia launched its worst assault on Kyiv since last summer, killing at least 12 people. The attack, Trump said, came at an inopportune moment: just as he believes he is on the verge of securing a deal, which he has told aides he wants in place by his 100th-day anniversary.
“I didn’t like last night,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Norway’s prime minister. “I wasn’t happy with it, and we’re in the midst of talking peace, and missiles were fired, and I was not happy with it.”
It was a rare moment of criticism directed toward Russia from a president whose ire over the course of his time back in office has mostly been aimed at the Ukrainians.
The exchange shined a light on a rising sense of exasperation among the president and his advisers at his inability to mount a successful pressure campaign against Putin to end the war. Trump bristled at a reporter’s suggestion that he had not applied pressure to the Russian leader.
“You don’t know what pressure I’m putting on Russia,” Trump snapped. “We’re putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and Russia knows that.”
Trump then argued that “it takes two to tango, and you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too.”
Moscow, he said, has already made a substantial concession by not “taking the whole country.”
“Stopping the war,” he said, is a “pretty big concession.”
Earlier in the day, he addressed Russia’s president directly on Truth Social, writing: “Vladimir, STOP!” – an unusually personal plea to convince Putin to cease the aerial bombardment.
“Not necessary,” Trump lamented, “and very bad timing.”
Still, the rare flash of anger toward Putin paled in scale and scope to Trump’s sustained criticism of Ukraine’s Zelensky, whom he accused this week of prolonging the war in his own country by not agreeing to a US peace plan that would grant Russia most of the territory it has seized. Some US allies are highly alarmed by that framework, CNN reported earlier Thursday, citing multiple diplomatic sources.
Trump’s social media message to Putin totaled 30 words; his dispatch a day earlier directed toward Zelensky was 259.
Trump signals his timeline
While Trump said again Thursday that he had “no allegiance” to leaders on either side of the conflict, that question is very much at the center of the path forward for the administration as it enters the next 100 days. But for one of the first times, he signaled a timeframe for his patience.
Asked what he would do if Putin kept firing bombs on Ukraine, Trump said: “I’d rather answer that question in a week. I want to see if we can have a deal. No reason to answer it now, but I won’t be happy, let me put it that way.”
Inside the Oval Office, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store had brought along his finance minister Jens Stoltenberg, who served as the secretary general of NATO during Trump’s first term in office.
Stoltenberg found success in that period convincing Trump of the importance of the defense alliance and avoided a US withdrawal from the bloc, earning him a reputation as a “Trump whisperer” when it came to matters of European defense.
Trump on Thursday seemed to remember him fondly, calling him “tremendous.”
An hour after the Norwegians pulled out of the White House driveway, however, officials did one better: the sitting NATO chief Mark Rutte arrived for his own meeting with Trump, talks not originally on the president’s schedule.
The session focused mostly on planning for NATO’s summer summit in the Hague, which some European officials have feared Trump might skip as his enmity for the defense alliance festers.
But Rutte also told reporters in the White House driveway Ukraine was discussed. After Trump insisted earlier in the day that Putin still wanted to reach peace, Rutte sounded decidedly less certain.
“I worked with him for four years between 2010 and 2014,” Rutte said, describing the period he served as prime minister of the Netherlands. “I stopped trying to read his mind.”
Rutte went on to argue that the US’ European allies are united in their view of Russia being a “long-term threat.”
“We all agree, in NATO, that Russia is the long-term threat to NATO territory, to the whole of the Euro-Atlantic territory,” Rutte told reporters.
The NATO secretary said that “something is on the table for Russia” in terms of a peace deal with Ukraine, but he argued that it’s up to Russia to bend.

Moscow sent 70 missiles and 145 drones toward Ukraine, mainly targeting Kyiv, in an attack that leader Volodymyr Zelensky said was aimed at pressuring the United States.
“I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.
Elaborating on the comments in the Oval Office later, Trump pledged that “things will happen” if Russian attacks continue.
At least 12 people died in the strikes with 90 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency services, and more casualties may be trapped under rubble. The emergency services said Moscow’s assault struck 13 locations in Kyiv, including residential buildings and civilian infrastructure.
It was the costliest attack on the city since July 2024, when 33 people were killed in an aerial barrage that targeted a hospital and residential districts.
Zelensky said during a trip to South Africa that the bombardment was “first and foremost” aimed at “pressuring the US.” He sought to push back against Trump’s efforts to corral Kyiv into making concessions, telling reporters: “The fact that Ukraine is ready to sit down at a negotiating table after (a) full ceasefire with terrorists… is a big compromise.”
And Zelensky, who was speaking to reporters shortly before Trump’s social media post, sought to highlight imbalances in the administration’s stances towards Kyiv and Moscow.
“This is (an issue of) our survival. We are very direct and transparent in this matter,” the Ukrainian leader said. “I don’t see strong pressure against Russia and new strong sanctions packages against the Russian aggression for now.”
Speaking in the White House on Thursday, Trump acknowledged “a lot of hatred” between Ukraine and Russia, but insisted: “I think they both want to make peace, I do believe so.”
“We are thinking very strongly that they both want peace, but they have to get to the table – we’re waiting a long time, they have to get them to the table, and I think we’re going to get peace,” Trump told reporters in response to a CNN question during a lunch meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
Zelensky said Moscow’s latest attack was “one of the most complex, most daring attacks coming from Russia.” Russia’s defense ministry said it carried out “a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, land and sea-based weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles on enterprises of the aviation, missile and space, mechanical engineering and armored industries of Ukraine, production of rocket fuel and gunpowder.”
“The strike objectives were achieved. All targets were hit,” Moscow said.
A search and rescue operation is underway to find people caught under rubble, according to Ukrainian local and national authorities.
Preliminary information suggested the Russians used a missile manufactured in North Korea, Zelensky said on social media, with Ukrainian special services verifying the details. If confirmed, “this will be further proof of the criminal nature of the alliance between Russia and Pyongyang,” the Ukrainian leader said.
Following the attacks on Kyiv, Zelensky announced he was cutting short his visit to South Africa, where he landed late on Wednesday, to return to Ukraine.
“It is extremely important that everyone around the world sees and understands what is really happening” he said, adding that Ukraine would immediately contact its international partners regarding its requests to strengthen air defenses.
French President Emmanuel Macron strongly condemned the attacks, saying Putin needs to “stop lying.”
“He says “I want peace” and continues to bomb and kill in Ukraine,” Macron told reporters during a visit to Madagascar.
The French leader said it was important to reiterate to the US that there is “one aggressor: Russia and one aggressed: Ukraine,” saying that “America’s anger should be focused on one person: President Putin.”
‘The first thing I felt was fear’
Air raid sirens blasted through Kyiv for six hours in the early hours of Thursday, as the Russian barrage gripped the city in fear. A CNN producer said they waited in a corridor with their child as missiles rained on the city, with a drone flying audibly outside their window.
Sirens are a near daily occurrence in Kyiv, but Thursday’s strikes served as an unwelcome reminder of the anxiety that pulsed through the capital in the early phases of the war. Images provided by the emergency services showed buildings engulfed in flames at some of the sites struck in the attacks.
“The first thing I felt was fear,” Iryna Dzen, a resident of an affected neighbourhood, told CNN on Wednesday. “You don’t understand anything when you wake up at night from an explosion. You are alive, but your parents, children, you don’t know if they are alive, where was the hit.”
“We went to the corridor, it was safer there, and started calling our relatives (to find out) whether they were alive or not,” she said. “And when we came (outside) and saw everything, it was a horror.”
Engineers, rescue workers and recovery dogs were searching on Wednesday for people believed to be trapped under the rubble of a home destroyed by the strikes in the Sviatoshyn district, said Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.
“Rescuers are doing everything they can to clear the rubble as quickly as possible,” the mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram. “We are currently clearing the rubble manually, we are not using any equipment because there may still be people under the rubble.”
Klymenko said eight regions of the country were targeted in what he called “a massive combined Russian attack” that also hit Zhytomyr, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytsky, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia.
Later on Thursday night, local administration officials told Russian state news agency TASS that a church complex in Russia’s Belgorod region burned down completely following a Ukrainian drone attack, but there were no casualties.
The Russian attacks followed a fresh public spat between Trump and Zelensky, specifically over the future of Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.
As part of its mission to seal a peace deal to end the three-year war, the US administration has proposed recognizing Russian control of Crimea, officials familiar with the details have told CNN.
Such a move would reverse a decade of US policy and could upset the widely held post-World War II consensus that international borders should not be changed by force.
Zelensky has repeatedly said Ukraine would not accept that, saying it would go against the country’s constitution. On Wednesday, Trump said Zelensky’s position was “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.”
“It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
Hours after sitting down with Ukrainians and Europeans in London on Wednesday in a bid to advance US efforts, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, told CNN that he believed this round of talks was “candid, positive, and productive.”
But another senior US official said that there was still a wide range of disagreements with Ukraine, including on the issue of sequencing and whether a ceasefire or an agreement on the Trump administration’s broad framework comes first.

The administration’s framework, presented in Paris last week, proposes significant sacrifices from Kyiv, including US recognition of Crimea as Russian territory and Ukraine ceding large swaths of territory to Russia, according to an official familiar. Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday called “to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today.”
Asked what concessions Russia was offering on Thursday, Trump replied, “stopping the war,” suggesting that not “taking the whole country” is a “pretty big concession.”
Multiple allied diplomats said they are rattled by what the Trump administration is proposing, because they believe such a framework sends a dangerous message to Russia’s Vladimir Putin and other world leaders, including China’s Xi Jinping, that illegal conquest could be rewarded, multiple diplomats said.
“This is about the fundamental principles of international law. This is very much about our own existence and the weakening of any safeguards that my or other countries have for our own independence,” an Eastern European diplomat told CNN. They and other sources spoke on background to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters.
“If one country in Europe is currently under pressure or being forced to give up parts of its own legal territory, territory that has been that has been recognized as part of Ukraine … if one country in Europe is forced to do that, no country in Europe or elsewhere can feel safe, NATO or no NATO,” the diplomat said.
The proposal for a de-facto US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia would reverse years of US policy affirming that, despite Russian occupation, Crimea is Ukrainian territory. European officials say they would not follow suit – leaving the US isolated.
Asian allies too are growing concerned about an end of war agreement that would reward Russia after the deadly conflict.
In private discussions with US partners, Asian diplomats have clearly articulated their concerns about the global implications of a settlement that violates Ukraine’s borders.
“China is watching. We have told the Trump administration that. We are worried about the message they might take away from any end to the war that appears to award Russia for the bloodshed,” said one Asian diplomat.
All eyes are now on the expected meeting between special envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin on Friday, which comes after sources say progress was made in talks with European, Ukrainian and US officials in London Wednesday. However, many Europeans fear that the progress might not be fast enough to satisfy Trump’s ambitions for a quick end to the war.
There are also concerns about what kind of additional promises Putin may make to Witkoff to garner favor with the US as European leaders warn that the Russian president is not to be trusted.
Officials are wondering what level of pressure will be applied on Witkoff’s fourth trip to Russia given the US’ desire for a quick end to the war and the US envoy’s past echoing of Putin’s arguments.
Trump on Thursday morning expressed dissatisfaction with the Russian leader after a deadly barrage of Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, saying that they were “not necessary, and very bad timing.”
Trump airs his frustration
“Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!,” he wrote on TruthSocial.
Hours later, however, the US president said he believed both Russia and Ukraine want peace.
However, Trump has lashed out at Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky, on far more occasions using much stronger language than when he has criticized Putin.
Meanwhile, even though the framework on the table has many allies deeply uneasy, negotiators have touted progress in the high-stakes diplomatic talks this week, including steps taken by the Ukrainians.
“We got [the Ukrainians] to a point where there will be conversations about territory,” said a European official familiar with the discussions, following the full day of meetings on Wednesday in London attended by senior officials from Ukraine, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the US envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.
Just that evolution in thinking was progress, the official said, noting they “managed to convince the Ukrainians to convince themselves to get in a more US administration-friendly position.”
Kellogg believed the talks to be “candid, positive and productive,” he told CNN.
Kellogg was the highest-ranking US official at the table for the talks, after the Trump administration pulled back plans for Secretary of State Marco Rubio to attend with the expectation that the meetings were not going to be decisive.
The Germans, French, and British said in a joint statement that “significant progress was made on reaching a common position on next steps.”
“The Ukrainians are coming around and understand the situation, even though they have red lines they cannot cross,” said a German official when asked how flexible the Ukrainians are being on territorial matters.
The British government has been working with the Ukrainians to try to move forward on the US framework, a second European official said, noting that it would be backed by security guarantees that are regularly being discussed by European allies, including potential troops in Ukraine. Russia has rejected such a prospect and Trump has said no American forces would go to Ukraine.
“There is a realpolitik reality: any deal that can get Russia on board will look unfavorable to the Ukrainians. But within reason the Ukrainians will have to come to terms with something that may be second best to a deal they would have wanted two years ago,” another European diplomat said. “That is just where we are.”
However, even if Zelensky were to get on board with a painful proposal that sees significant land concessions – a move that one Ukrainian lawmaker said would be “political suicide” – it would not be accepted by Ukrainian parliament, the lawmaker said.
Some have noted that there doesn’t seem to be a US strategy for implementing a potential deal and Washington may be barreling past the idea of a ceasefire in order to simply end the conflict as quickly as possible.
“The American position is clear: take it or leave it, this is where we are,” the first European official said. “The Ukrainian position – and to some extent ours – is we accept there needs to be territorial negotiations but when does that come?”
What exactly the US administration is arguing for at the moment, beyond a halt to the fighting, remains unclear. More than a month after calling for an immediate ceasefire – which Russia rejected – it appears to be trying to leap-frog ahead to the far more complicated prospect of nailing down the contours of a permanent peace.
“At this juncture, we judge that getting agreement on key terms now is the most expeditious way to achieve the core objective” said one US official familiar with the months-long back and forth who criticized the administration’s lack of strategic approach, calling it “somewhat directionless, rudderless, confused.”
“The diplomacy has been very ad hoc. The confusion over who does what on the file is as pronounced as ever,” said the official. “People seem to accept the chaos.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/europe/russia-strikes-kyiv-trump-zelensky-crimea-intl-hnk/index.html,"Trump writes ‘Vladimir, STOP!’ after Russia launches deadliest strikes on Kyiv since last summer",2025-04-24 06:34:52,"US President Donald Trump said he is “not happy” after Russia launched its deadliest wave of attacks on Kyiv in nine months, telling President Vladimir Putin to “STOP!” as he attempts to push Ukraine to agree on a contentious ceasefire proposal.
Moscow sent 70 missiles and 145 drones toward Ukraine, mainly targeting Kyiv, in an attack that leader Volodymyr Zelensky said was aimed at pressuring the United States.
“I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.
Elaborating on the comments in the Oval Office later, Trump pledged that “things will happen” if Russian attacks continue.
At least 12 people died in the strikes with 90 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency services, and more casualties may be trapped under rubble. The emergency services said Moscow’s assault struck 13 locations in Kyiv, including residential buildings and civilian infrastructure.
It was the costliest attack on the city since July 2024, when 33 people were killed in an aerial barrage that targeted a hospital and residential districts.
Zelensky said during a trip to South Africa that the bombardment was “first and foremost” aimed at “pressuring the US.” He sought to push back against Trump’s efforts to corral Kyiv into making concessions, telling reporters: “The fact that Ukraine is ready to sit down at a negotiating table after (a) full ceasefire with terrorists… is a big compromise.”
And Zelensky, who was speaking to reporters shortly before Trump’s social media post, sought to highlight imbalances in the administration’s stances towards Kyiv and Moscow.
“This is (an issue of) our survival. We are very direct and transparent in this matter,” the Ukrainian leader said. “I don’t see strong pressure against Russia and new strong sanctions packages against the Russian aggression for now.”
Speaking in the White House on Thursday, Trump acknowledged “a lot of hatred” between Ukraine and Russia, but insisted: “I think they both want to make peace, I do believe so.”
“We are thinking very strongly that they both want peace, but they have to get to the table – we’re waiting a long time, they have to get them to the table, and I think we’re going to get peace,” Trump told reporters in response to a CNN question during a lunch meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
Zelensky said Moscow’s latest attack was “one of the most complex, most daring attacks coming from Russia.” Russia’s defense ministry said it carried out “a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, land and sea-based weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles on enterprises of the aviation, missile and space, mechanical engineering and armored industries of Ukraine, production of rocket fuel and gunpowder.”
“The strike objectives were achieved. All targets were hit,” Moscow said.
A search and rescue operation is underway to find people caught under rubble, according to Ukrainian local and national authorities.
Preliminary information suggested the Russians used a missile manufactured in North Korea, Zelensky said on social media, with Ukrainian special services verifying the details. If confirmed, “this will be further proof of the criminal nature of the alliance between Russia and Pyongyang,” the Ukrainian leader said.
Following the attacks on Kyiv, Zelensky announced he was cutting short his visit to South Africa, where he landed late on Wednesday, to return to Ukraine.
“It is extremely important that everyone around the world sees and understands what is really happening” he said, adding that Ukraine would immediately contact its international partners regarding its requests to strengthen air defenses.
French President Emmanuel Macron strongly condemned the attacks, saying Putin needs to “stop lying.”
“He says “I want peace” and continues to bomb and kill in Ukraine,” Macron told reporters during a visit to Madagascar.
The French leader said it was important to reiterate to the US that there is “one aggressor: Russia and one aggressed: Ukraine,” saying that “America’s anger should be focused on one person: President Putin.”
‘The first thing I felt was fear’
Air raid sirens blasted through Kyiv for six hours in the early hours of Thursday, as the Russian barrage gripped the city in fear. A CNN producer said they waited in a corridor with their child as missiles rained on the city, with a drone flying audibly outside their window.
Sirens are a near daily occurrence in Kyiv, but Thursday’s strikes served as an unwelcome reminder of the anxiety that pulsed through the capital in the early phases of the war. Images provided by the emergency services showed buildings engulfed in flames at some of the sites struck in the attacks.
“The first thing I felt was fear,” Iryna Dzen, a resident of an affected neighbourhood, told CNN on Wednesday. “You don’t understand anything when you wake up at night from an explosion. You are alive, but your parents, children, you don’t know if they are alive, where was the hit.”
“We went to the corridor, it was safer there, and started calling our relatives (to find out) whether they were alive or not,” she said. “And when we came (outside) and saw everything, it was a horror.”
Engineers, rescue workers and recovery dogs were searching on Wednesday for people believed to be trapped under the rubble of a home destroyed by the strikes in the Sviatoshyn district, said Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.
“Rescuers are doing everything they can to clear the rubble as quickly as possible,” the mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram. “We are currently clearing the rubble manually, we are not using any equipment because there may still be people under the rubble.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/europe/trump-putin-peace-ukraine-analysis-intl/index.html,"Trump’s peace offer on Ukraine is generous to Russia, and may not even be enough for Putin",2025-04-24 15:15:13,"Imposing a deadline on a negotiation for a deal you desperately want is a risky tactic if your only move is to walk away.
President Donald Trump has threatened just this, and emphasized on Wednesday it is proving easier to make a deal with Russia than Ukraine. Yet that seems a perilous misreading of his own predicament. It is easier for Trump to pressure Kyiv, yes, because they are dependent on US aid and intelligence for their mere survival. But that does not mean Russia is more amenable to a deal. In fact, they are palpably dragging their feet.
This is where the gulf between a life in business deals and one steeped in geopolitical negotiation yawns desperately. Now, Trump is not in the world of real estate – he is not trying to get Putin to buy something. Trump is pushing hard and fast for the Kremlin to agree to terms to end the war that Putin has clearly divined will improve, not worsen, over time.
Trump applied pressure to Putin briefly on Thursday, posting “Vladimir: STOP!”, after Russian missiles targeted Kyiv, killing at least 12 people. But even the scolding used a friendly lexicon, and seemed as upset at the timing of the Russian attack as its casualties.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly rebuffed the US and Ukraine’s now 44-day old offer of a 30-day, unconditional ceasefire. Instead, the Kremlin unilaterally declared a truce for Easter that lasted 30 hours and that Ukraine claimed they violated about 5,000 times. Both sides have accused the other of breaching an energy and infrastructure truce for March and April
This dabbling with ceasefires has left a huge question mark over whether diplomatic agreements will be honoured, or can deliver. Ukraine’s allies point to the Easter truce – unilateral, brief, sudden – as proof the Kremlin think ceasefires are for re-equipping, and negotiation is what happens when you are biding time so you can later pursue your military goals.
The larger problem with Trump’s proposed deal is it is not publicly known what he expects Moscow to cede. A lasting pause in the fighting does seem, on the evidence of the past month, to be a stretch. A wider US-Russia détente may be desired by the White House. But without an enduring settlement for Ukraine, this would result in a long-term fissure in the Transatlantic alliance and even NATO. That would likely spook many establishment Republicans, countless Americans, damage the dollar, and US economic and geopolitical standing. These are real costs that would outweigh the gain of a likely brief make-up with the Kremlin.
Trump’s second problem is it is also unclear – in public so far - what he expects President Zelensky to cede. He told Zelensky in his post on Wednesday to “GET IT DONE”, but it is unclear what the IT is.
Trump was specific he was not demanding Kyiv recognise Russia-annexed Crimea as part of Russia, as has been reported (Ukraine’s constitution prohibits such an act, as it also demands Ukraine move to become part of NATO – an ambition Trump may also ask it to abandon.)
The proposed Trump deal, it seems, may ask Ukraine to accept a freezing of the frontlines, and perhaps American recognition of Crimea as Russian. But both concessions are of limited utility.
Crimea is a peninsula, linked to Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine yet separated from Russia bar a precarious bridge. European and Ukrainian sanctions would continue to isolate Crimea after any peace deal, and both Europe and Kyiv have made it clear they won’t accept its recognition as part of Russia - the altering of land borders by force. With this, Trump is offering Putin a frail fig leaf of respectability. But that is not, in of itself, surely enough?
So what of deal that freezes the frontlines? This may also not be in Moscow’s interests. Putin’s recent bid to drag out the diplomatic process suggests the Kremlin thinks its best battlefield days may lie ahead of it. The oil price may continue to drop, and Moscow may feel manpower crunches ahead. Yet these problems are minor compared to Kyiv’s recruitment issues and the likely dent in its funding when Biden-era cash runs out next year.
The Kremlin’s other vague red lines, voiced by various officials, will be as disruptive to a longer peace. They don’t want European troops acting as a peacekeeping or reassurance force on Ukrainian soil – an idea quite advanced in its planning, that echoes the early version of a peace plan proffered by US envoy Keith Kellogg when he was a private citizen. They are against continued foreign aid to – and intelligence sharing with – Ukraine. Russia wants sanctions lifted up front, ideally. None of this is compatible with wider security concerns on the continent, and will force the Europeans, and Ukraine, to go it alone. That too does not bring a peace deal.
The overriding problem is Putin thinks time is on his side and Trump has repeatedly said the clock is ticking. These two contrasting positions will not yield a lasting deal. The Kremlin has perhaps wisely ascertained it can, over months, hive off tiny concessions from the White House, and slowly build a geopolitical picture that is more in its favour. Consider the first 90 days of Trump’s presidency and how far the world has already changed in Moscow’s favour.
At each crunch point, Moscow also sees Trump turn on Zelensky. The Kremlin see little or no consequences for it breaching the energy - or its own unilateral - ceasefire. It sees a vividly impatient US president, whose team are often loose with the facts, and whose key envoy, Steve Witkoff, struggled to name the regions of Ukraine under occupation in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson. All are also only partially under Russian occupation.
The longer Moscow talks, the better the deal seems to get. The longer it fights, the better the battlefield will likely also get. There is every incentive for the Kremlin to keep diplomacy alive, even to sign on to an early, chaotic deal it may later renege on. But there is no reason to believe it wants talks that actually resolve the war, or fighting to stop either.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/travel/russians-still-traveling-europe-despite-sanctions/index.html,Russians are still traveling around Europe despite sanctions. Not everyone’s happy about it,2025-04-23 10:00:36,"Since the start of 2022, Russian influencer Egor Melo has been traveling around Europe. Last year, he went to Zurich to see Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, celebrated New Year’s Eve in Paris, and enjoyed the historical sights of Nuremberg, Germany.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, direct flights between Russia and the EU were suspended. In September of the same year, the EU suspended its visa facilitation agreement with Russia, making Russian citizens face a lengthier, more expensive visa approval process to enter the EU.
Processing fees for Schengen visas — which allow non-EU citizens to travel within the 29-country European Schengen area — have increased due to the suspension of visa-free agreements, some EU countries, many of which border Russia are offering fewer consular appointments for Russians, and the EU has advised member states to scrutinize Russian applications thoroughly.
The new rules don’t prevent Russian tourists from traveling to Europe — nor is there anything illegal about their trips. It’s just making the process more difficult and expensive.
Latvia, Norway, Poland, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic have gone even further — issuing full bans on almost all tourist visas for Russian citizens.
But on his Instagram, dedicated “to showing that travel in Europe is accessible to everyone,” Melos claims he’s “been in two of these countries in the past year with a tourist visa and had no problems.”
His advice? Obtain a visa from another Schengen country. “For example, fly to Italy and from there travel to these countries.”
Melos declined a CNN request to talk about his claims.
The Baltic states’ ban only applies to Russian citizens who cross the external Schengen border — not entry from other Schengen countries.
“Once you are in the Schengen zone, you can travel within the Schengen zone anywhere, because there is, in principle, no internal control (…) This is not unlawful. This is the Schengen system,” Sarah Ganty, co-author of a 2022 Yale Journal of International Law paper that opposed the visa bans, told CNN.
Getting a permit ‘isn’t that difficult’
Melo isn’t alone in continuing to travel. The interior minister for Latvia reportedly condemned data presented at an EU meeting, which stated that 565,069 Schengen visas were issued to Russians in 2024: 90% for tourism. It’s a massive drop from the four million issued pre-pandemic in 2019, but an increase of 25% from 2023. The visa refusal rate for Russians diverges strongly among member states — from 1% to 65% in the first half of 2024, according to an EU report.
“The stabilization of Schengen visa issuance” has contributed to the growth in demand for travel to Europe, the vice president of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (ATOR), claimed in an interview with Russian publication Vedomosti.
One well-known travel blogger from Russia, who asked to not have their name included for fear of future visa applications being denied, agreed with ATOR. They’ve recently visited Norway — a country that stopped issuing visas to Russian tourists in May 2024.
“Right now, obtaining a visa requires many additional documents that weren’t needed before, such as purchased flight tickets, hotel bookings, or even tax certificates,” they said. “Jokes about needing a doctor’s note (to travel) soon are becoming more common.”
But they still see travel as accessible.
“Let’s be honest — getting an EU residence permit, like a Spanish digital nomad visa, isn’t that difficult right now. Some people are opting for a three-year EU residence permit instead of a visa, which has also become a common practice,” the blogger said. “For example, if you have children living in the Baltics, the easiest way to get there is through Italy, France or Spain. The scheme is simple: you fly to Rome, spend some time there, and then travel through the Estonia-Russia border after first flying to your relatives.”
No direct flights means that “Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Serbia” had become the main transit countries for those living in Russia’s West, while “if you live in the Russian Far East, for example, in Vladivostok, it might be easier to fly through China,” according to them. But there are ways to avoid the extra costs when returning to Russia.
‘No questions were asked’
Even without an EU residence permit, it is possible to enter Russia through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the travel blogger said.
“That’s why, in the summer, there are long queues at the Narva-Ivangorod border, as flying to Tallinn is cheap, and many people with tourist visas prefer to return via the Estonian-Russian border rather than through, say, Istanbul or Antalya.”
Russian travel companies are still offering tours to countries that have supposedly blocked visas for Russian tourists. For example, one company, YouTravel, is currently offering a 15-day road trip through Finland, Sweden, Norway and Latvia in June. All these countries, apart from Sweden, have banned Russian tourists. The agency says it will assist in obtaining a visa free of charge.
So how easy is it really to obtain a visa? Asked about the process to obtain a visa to Latvia, which has a complete ban on issuing tourist visas to Russians, a sales assistant at St Petersburg-based agency Visateka said they could help obtain entry “through a third country.” They advised that the easiest document-wise for a June travel date would be France.
For the equivalent of $300, the sales assistant said Visateka could reserve flights and a hotel, and prepare documents to take to the French embassy for a visa appointment. Visateka claims that for France, Italy and Spain, the chances of having a visa approved were around 93%. Their website claims that in the first two weeks of April, they’ve obtained 20 visas for Russian citizens to enter Latvia, 93 to Lithuania and 20 to Poland.
“Last year, we visited Riga to see the Christmas markets,” Daria from St. Petersburg told CNN. She requested her last name be omitted in fear of her next Schengen visa application being denied. With a Spanish visa, she flew to Istanbul, then to Madrid, before boarding a flight to the Latvian capital on the same day.
“No questions were asked at the airport,” she said about the use of her Spanish visa to visit Riga. “It’s common practice.”
“I’m not part of this war, I don’t support Putin. I don’t understand why I should be discriminated against and treated as if I’m a threat.”
Growing frustration
The Vinsky online travel forum is populated with similar stories. One holder of a French visa shared their experience of flying via Vienna, then taking a plane to Riga in the evening: “I was worried about what to say, but in the end (at Vienna airport) they asked exactly zero questions.”
Another, who had been granted an Italian tourist visa, said they flew to Rome and then on to Riga. One traveler from Moscow asked, “If you enter Italy with an Italian visa and fly from Milan to Amsterdam a few days later, what are the risks?” Another responded, “Once you get a visa, you’ll be able to travel along the route you’ve planned without any stress.”
Regarding the increase in visas issued in 2024, the EU Commission told CNN that it “closely monitors the implementation of the guidelines through the Blueprint Network.” The Blueprint Network is the EU’s framework for monitoring migration. “The Commission is working with Member States to promote consistent implementation of the guidelines.”
Last year, Hungary extended visa exemptions to Russians and Belarusians, and according to the European Travel Commission’s statistics, Russian arrivals to Hungary increased by a third. In April 2024, Romania restarted issuing short-stay visas to Russian tourists on a discretionary basis after experiencing a drop in tourist revenue, another ETC report states. In early December, Italian visa centers in Moscow reduced processing times for visas.
As the war grinds into its fourth third year, frustration is growing. Rihards Kozlovskis, Latvia’s minister of internal affairs, has called on EU countries to join Latvia in banning Schengen tourist visas for Russian citizens. Speaking at a meeting of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels, he said it is member states’ “moral duty to deny such a service.”
“We are facing both illegal border crossings and acts of sabotage, such as the burning of the Museum of the Occupation, drones crossing the border, propaganda attempts to influence public opinion, etc.,” Kozlovskis said. “Therefore I urge all member states to take this threat seriously.”
The Russian travel blogger CNN spoke to said he would be “disappointed” if such sanctions were introduced.
“Russia has its own restrictions on travel to so-called ‘unfriendly’ countries. Police officers, judges and government employees are already prohibited from traveling, so those connected to the state are not going anywhere anyway,” he said. “I don’t think ordinary Russian travelers pose any kind of threat to the Latvian minister with their presence.”
Bans ‘unlawful’
A European Commission spokesperson said that the organization had “adopted clear sets of guidance to support Member States to deprioritize visas for Russians and focus on security and border control. Heightened scrutiny should be performed in a way that preserves the right to seek asylum and prevents risks of non-refoulement.”
Ganty, the law academic, argued that such bans were never lawful. She described the de facto national-level ban against Russian citizens — introduced by Poland, Finland and the Baltic States — as a breach of EU law.
“These Russians who are applying for Schengen visas have mainly been depicted as tourists having fun in Europe, but there are lots of people who have family members across the border, there are people who are dissenters, there are health reasons why someone might need a short-stay visa,” she said.
“I think we really need to continue the dialogue with Russian citizens, especially those who are trying to flee the regime and oppose the regime. I think it’s really important to be welcoming towards them.”
When Mark Temnycky, a Ukrainian-American and fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, visited Montenegro in 2023 with his cousins, he was surprised at the number of Russians who were also there — and the reaction they got from the Russians while posing with a Ukrainian flag by St John’s Fortress, a historic landmark overlooking the town of Kotor.
“We got some looks and stares from Russian speakers who were making comments (…) we’re just taking photos with the flag,” he said.
“In Greece, as well as in Cyprus, when I was there in August of 2023, it was still very heavily visited by ethnic Russians and Russian speakers who were on holiday there and just again — from a moral perspective — it just did not sit with me that these people are supporting the country’s war and then go on vacation.
“I have many family and friends in Ukraine who haven’t been on vacation in several years because they don’t know where to go, and many of them are not permitted to leave the country and fear for their safety. It’s very strange.”
He said he wants the EU to go further with bans on tourist visas.
“I would argue that European countries aren’t doing this to punish the Russians, just for the sake of punishing the Russians. It’s to explore other avenues to put additional pressures on Russia. And I think at this point, you gotta get creative, and if this is another way to do that, then I think there’s no harm in trying to see what happens.”",['Elizabeth McBride'],en

“It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social.
Any move to recognize Russia’s control of Crimea would reverse a decade of US policy and could upset the widely held post-World War Two consensus that international borders should not be changed by force.
Russian missiles struck Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv and the country’s second largest city Kharkiv hours after Trump’s post, Ukrainian authorities said, with at least nine people killed and some 70 wounded in the latest attacks.
Trump’s comments came after a meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine had been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he wouldn’t attend.
Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues,” though a US official and two European diplomats familiar with the matter said the top US diplomat didn’t go because the administration did not feel that they were at a decisive point in the ongoing talks and Rubio didn’t feel attending would be the best use of his time.
“It was better to let talks play out than create the illusion that a breakthrough was imminent,” said one of the European diplomats.
“Emotions have run high today,” Zelensky said on X Wednesday after the talks.
In what seemed to be an indirect response to Trump’s criticism of Zelensky being unwilling to recognize Russian control of Crimea, Zelensky vowed Kyiv would abide by its constitution: “Ukraine will always act in accordance with its Constitution and we are absolutely sure that our partners - in particular the USA - will act in line with its strong decisions.”
Zelensky shared a screenshot of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s 2018 Crimea Declaration which rejected Russia’s occupation of the peninsula.
Britain’s Foreign Office had confirmed earlier on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists.
The developments throw new uncertainty over the diplomatic efforts to end Russia’s war. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022.
US Vice President JD Vance threatened to abandon negotiations on Wednesday, telling reporters during a visit to India: “We’ve issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and Ukrainians, and it’s time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process. We’ve engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on the ground work.”
But Ukraine’s European allies, particularly Britain and France, have been hoping to bridge the divide. Wednesday’s talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire.
After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead.
Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday, a US official said.
The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia’s control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. It would also put a ceasefire in place along the front lines of the war, the official said.
Zelensky made clear Tuesday that he was open to talks with Russia, but that Kyiv would not accept a deal that recognizes Moscow’s control of Crimea.
“Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. “There is nothing to talk about. It is against our constitution.”
Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn’t say that. What I said is the current line, somewhere close to them is where you’re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict. Now of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own. There’s gonna have to be some territorial swaps.”
The war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching.
Difficult discussions
The talks in London were scheduled as US officials publicly voiced frustration over the lack of progress at bringing an end to the war.
Trump has said he would “have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it” from both sides for the US to continue negotiations, after Rubio warned last week that Washington could walk away from its efforts to end the conflict if there were no signs of progress.
The broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in a short timeframe. There are still pieces of the framework to be filled out and the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that this week, the official told CNN.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the negotiations were “hopefully moving in the right direction,” and declined to say what “stepping back” from the peace efforts might look like for the US.
Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv.
However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow’s invasion in 2022.
On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president’s remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia’s Interfax news agency.","['Todd Symons', 'Rob Picheta', 'Kylie Atwood']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/21/europe/putin-easter-truce-ukraine-analysis-intl/index.html,The Kremlin’s 30-hour truce was designed to shift blame to Ukraine. Did Trump buy it?,2025-04-21 13:10:40,"It was unexpected, barely implemented and not even extended. But the Kremlin’s hopelessly short-lived Easter truce was aimed directly at US President Donald Trump and at shifting blame for his disastrous peacemaking efforts in the Ukraine war.
When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a surprise 30-hour ceasefire on Saturday, there was already skepticism in Ukraine and beyond that it was anything more than a cynical public relations stunt amid growing criticism that Moscow had become a foot-dragging obstacle to peace.
But it also revealed that Putin could suspend the conflict at any time, fueling hopes that the short putting down of weapons might be rolled over and become the start of something more substantial, perhaps even creating space for a serious peace process to take root.
Instead, the Easter truce simply expired at midnight on Sunday, exactly when the Kremlin always said it would. Ukraine called on Russia to maintain the ceasefire for longer. But as far as we know there weren’t even talks to extend. For Moscow, it seems, this was never going to be the beginning of the end of the war.
From the moment the guns fell silent — or were meant to — at 6 p.m. Moscow time on Saturday, there were reports of widescale violations on both sides. The Ukrainian military accused Russian forces of launching 2,935 attacks along the vast frontlines, including 1,882 instances of shelling and 96 Russian ground assaults.
But it’s the indignant Russian cries of foul play the Kremlin is gambling Trump will hear loud and clear.
Russian officials alleged nearly 5,000 Ukrainian violations, reiterating that a longer ceasefire, such as the 30 days proposed by Trump and already agreed to by Kyiv but rejected by Moscow, is not viable.
“Ukraine, by not observing the Easter truce proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, has shown that it is not capable of ceasing fire even for 30 hours,” said the Russian foreign ministry’s ambassador-at-large for crimes of the Kyiv regime, Rodion Miroshnik, on Kremlin-controlled television on Sunday.
For the Kremlin, this was a goodwill gesture, in the form of a Russian ceasefire, which exposed the Ukrainian leadership, and their European backers, as the real roadblock to a Trump deal.
The White House has repeatedly echoed Kremlin talking points in the past and it may be correct to think it could do so again.
There has been growing unease in Moscow at what could happen if an unpredictable Trump really does walk away from his Ukraine peacemaking efforts, as he has threatened to do if there is not progress soon.
Putin’s biggest concern is that Trump will blame Russia, bolster US support for Kyiv and impose tough new economic sanctions on Moscow, spelling an end to the potential benefits of a reconfiguration of US-Russia relations.
The US remains “committed to achieving a full and comprehensive ceasefire,” a State Department spokesperson said Sunday, after Kyiv accused Moscow of repeatedly breaking the truce.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that Washington could end its efforts on ending the Ukrainian conflict within “days” if there weren’t any signs of progress.
Convincing Trump that Ukraine, not Russia, is responsible for any ultimate failure of his peace process is, therefore, an important Kremlin objective and was likely a key reason why the Easter truce was declared.
Before it ended on Sunday night, with the Kremlin explaining that no order was given by Putin to prolong the ceasefire, there were signs Trump remains engaged — for now.
“Hopefully Russia amd (sic) Ukraine will make a deal this week. Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune,” Trump posted on Truth Social Sunday in capital letters, as he returned from a golf course he owns outside Washington.
The words were upbeat and Trump, for the moment, seems strangely optimistic there can still be a deal, despite the weekend’s dashed hopes of a breakthrough in the Ukraine war.",['Matthew Chance'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/20/europe/ukraine-easter-ceasefire-violations-intl/index.html,Putin accused of breaching own truce as brief pause to fighting in Ukraine nears end,2025-04-20 10:06:56,"Ukraine accused Russia of breaching the Easter truce that was announced without prior warning by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky accusing Putin of only being interested in PR.
In a surprise move on Saturday, Putin said he had ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” from 6 p.m. Moscow time that day (11 a.m. ET) until midnight Sunday into Monday (5 p.m. Sunday ET).
Ukrainian officials urged Russia to extend the truce. However, the expiration time came with no mention of an extension from Russia.
Earlier on Sunday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Putin had not given a command to extend the brief Easter ceasefire beyond the previously announced timeframe, according to the Russian state news agency TASS.
Ukrainian leaders said that while there was some slowdown in fighting overnight, the number of attacks conducted by Russia began to rise again as Sunday wore on. Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Defense accused Ukraine of breaching the ceasefire.
Putin’s announcement was met with immediate skepticism from Ukraine, although Kyiv agreed to the 30-hour truce; there have been no pauses in fighting since Russia launched its unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Questions were raised over Putin’s motives in calling the brief halt to hostilities, which came just after the Trump administration threatened to abandon peace efforts without tangible signs of progress. Russia has previously rejected a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire that was agreed to by Ukraine.
On Sunday, Trump said that “hopefully” Russia and Ukraine would strike an agreement. He didn’t specify what type of deal might be made between the two warring nations.
‘Russia is the only source of the war’
Putin’s truce came just hours after the Russian military announced that it had pushed Ukraine’s troops out of one of their last remaining footholds in the southern Russian region of Kursk.
Zelensky said Ukraine’s military had recorded an increase in Russian shelling and the use of drones since 10 a.m. local time Sunday (3 a.m. ET).
“In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage,” he said.
“This Easter proved unequivocally that Russia is the only source of the war and the reason for its prolongation. We are ready to move towards peace and a full, unconditional and fair ceasefire that can last at least 30 days, but Russia has not yet responded to this,” Zelensky added later.
Ukraine’s 66th mechanized brigade, which is currently positioned near Lyman in the eastern Ukrainian Donetsk region, said it believed Russia was using the ceasefire to set up roads for heavy military equipment in the area. The brigade said that a blown-up piece of equipment that had been blocking an important river crossing since early April was cleared on Sunday, as Russian troops took advantage of the pause in firing.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian leader said that while there were 387 instances of shelling and 19 assaults by Russia overnight, the Russian army was “attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine.”
However, by mid-afternoon, Zelensky cited a report from Ukraine’s Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi, who said the use of heavy weapons by Russian troops was increasing.
“Between the beginning of the day and 4 p.m., a total of 46 Russian assault actions in various directions and 901 attacks took place, and of this number, 448 were made with heavy weapons. More than four hundred uses of (drones) by Russians have already been recorded,” Zelensky said.
In Russia’s Kursk region – the scene of a shock Ukrainian incursion last year – Moscow’s forces conducted artillery strikes and used drones, he added.
“Everywhere our warriors are responding as the enemy deserves, based on the specific combat situation. Ukraine will continue to act symmetrically,” Zelensky said.
Ukrainian troops deployed in the Sumy region told CNN that Russian units did not stop advancing during the ceasefire there. Troops deployed in Pokrovsk and near Kupiansk told CNN that Russian forces appeared to use the ceasefire to build up their presence.
For its part, Russia’s defense ministry said Sunday that its forces had been “strictly observing” the ceasefire since 6 p.m. on Saturday evening, and accused Ukraine of violating the pause in fighting over 1,000 times.
The ministry said that Ukrainian units had shot at Russian positions 444 times during the night, carried out over 900 drone attacks and used 48 plane-type UAVs.
“As a result, there were deaths and injuries among the civilian population and damage to civilian objects,” a statement from the ministry claimed.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also accused Ukraine of using US-supplied HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems to carry out strikes on Russia.
The Ukrainian leader has called for the ceasefire to be extended to 30 days, in line with a US-led proposal last month that Russia rejected. On Sunday morning, he reiterated that the proposal still stands, despite the accusations of repeated violations.
Ukraine proposed a stoppage on “any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days,” Zelensky said. “If Russia does not agree to such a step, it will be proof that it intends to continue doing only those things which destroy human lives and prolong the war,” he added.
Ukraine’s Armed Forces have stated that they will comply with orders to limit fire on Russia’s army, but would not show restraint if fired on first.
A commander on the ground warned Sunday: “Yesterday we were told to limit fire against the Russians. If they don’t assault or provoke us, we don’t fire. If they move or fire at us, we can answer.”
Putin said the ceasefire was on humanitarian grounds but added that his troops would respond to any “provocations.”","['Helen Regan', 'Sophie Tanno', 'Ivana Kottasová']",en

Putin said “all hostilities” would halt between 6 p.m. Moscow time on Saturday (11 a.m. ET) and midnight on Monday (5 p.m. Sunday ET).
“We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example,” he said, adding that the truce would help Russia determine how sincere Kyiv is about wanting to reach a ceasefire.
However, just hours after the announcement, Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of continuing to fight. “According to the report of the commander-in-chief, Russian assault operations continue in some parts of the front line and Russian artillery continues to fire,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an address on Saturday night.
Kyiv has responded to the truce declaration with skepticism, with Zelensky pointing out that Putin still has not agreed to a US-led proposal for 30 days of ceasefire.
“If Russia is now suddenly ready to actually join the format of complete and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act in a mirror image, as it will on the Russian side. Silence in response to silence, strikes in defense of strikes,” Zelensky said, calling for the Easter truce to be extended to 30 days.
“This will show Russia’s true intentions, because 30 hours is enough for headlines, but not for real confidence-building measures. Thirty days can give peace a chance,” he said.
The timing of the announcement also sparked some questions – coming one day after the Trump administration indicated it was running out of patience with Russia and Ukraine, and just hours after Russia’s Defense Ministry announced its forces had pushed Ukrainian troops from one of their last remaining footholds in Russia’s Kursk region, where the Ukrainians staged a surprise incursion last year.
“Unfortunately, we have had a long history of (Putin’s) statements not matching his actions… Russia can agree at any time to the proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, which has been on the table since March,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X.
Hours after declaring the ceasefire, Putin attended an Orthodox Easter service at Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior, alongside the city’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin and other worshippers, according to Reuters.
Putin could be seen holding a lit red candle and crossing himself as Patriarch Kirill led the service. Kirill is the head of Russia’s Orthodox Church, a faithful backer of the Russian leader and an advocate for the war in Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Zelensky used his Easter address to call on Ukrainians to not lose faith, saying, “evil may have its hour, but God will have his day.”
“May that day come. May evil’s hour end. May the day of life arrive. The day of peace. The day of Ukraine. The day that lasts for centuries. And we will be able to come together again. At one table. On a peaceful Easter,” he said.
Attacks continue, say Ukrainian officials
In an update Sunday morning, Zelensky said Ukraine had recorded hundreds of instances of Russian shelling since the ceasefire was announced. Between 6 p.m. local time on Saturday and midnight, there were 387 instances of shelling and 19 assaults by Russian forces, he said.
“Overall, as of Easter morning we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,” Zelensky said. Across various front lines, Ukraine said it recorded 59 cases of Russian shelling and five assaults by Russian units.
Fighting also continued in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, where Ukrainian troops have been active, Zelenksy had said earlier.
The head of Kherson’s regional military administration, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on Saturday evening local time that a high-rise building in the Dniprovskyi district of Kherson had caught fire after being struck by drones. Russian drones also attacked the villages of Urozhayne and Stanislav, he said.
“The shelling continues and civilians are under attack again,” Prokudin said. “This is another confirmation that Russia has nothing sacred.”
CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.
Air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv and several other regions soon after Putin’s announcement. But the Ukrainian Air Force said Sunday it has not reported any aerial threats or missiles since about 10 p.m. Saturday.
Andrii Kovalenko, who heads the Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation, a government body, said on Telegram at 7 p.m. local time that “the Russians continue to fire in all directions.” Moscow and Kyiv are currently on the same time.
Ukrainian troops at three separate locations along the front lines told CNN that as of 8 p.m. Saturday, there was no sign of fighting easing.
There have been no pauses in the conflict since Russia launched its unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022.
The sudden nature of Putin’s announcement and the short duration of the proposed truce gave Kyiv little room to prepare or maneuver. Many Ukrainian troops participating in ongoing assaults or reconnaissance missions would have been in position already, as any moves are typically made during the night due to the threat from Russian troops.
Ukraine has previously been skeptical about such temporary pauses in conflict, having rejected a temporary ceasefire to coincide with the Orthodox Christmas holiday in January 2023, believing that Russia had ulterior motives in calling for a stop to the fighting, such as using the pause to bring in more troops.
A key moment
Putin’s announcement comes at a pivotal time for the war.
As well as in Kursk, fighting continues along the eastern front line, which has barely moved in the past three years as neither side has been able to make significant gains.
While Ukraine has recently managed to push Russian troops back from areas around Toretsk, Russia has been inching forward near Kupyansk, Lyman and Kurakhove, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor.
Separately, the two sides conducted one of the largest prisoner exchanges of the conflict on Saturday.
According to Zelensky, 277 captured Ukrainian soldiers were returned home. The Russian Defense Ministry said it had swapped 246 captured Ukrainian soldiers for the same number of Russian troops, and that as a “gesture of good will” Russia also exchanged 31 wounded Ukrainian troops for 15 wounded Russian servicemen.
As with previous exchanges, the swap was mediated by the United Arab Emirates.
At the same time, US-led peace efforts are stuttering as Moscow continues to stall, having previously rejected the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.
On Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US was ready to “move on” within days from efforts to bring peace to Ukraine, if there were no tangible signs of progress.","['Kosta Gak', 'Catherine Nicholls', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Ivana Kottasová']",en

If Ukraine’s allies needed proof of Moscow’s wild cynicism when it comes to peace, the announcement of an immediate truce for Easter provided just that.
It came mere hours after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his boss President Donald Trump said they would need in the coming days an urgent sign that the Kremlin was serious about peace.
For Russia’s proponents, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement on Saturday looked like a nod to Trump – but the sudden declaration is so riddled with practical flaws, before it even gets out of the box, that it is likely to be simply used by Putin to support his false notion Kyiv does not want his war to stop.
It will be a logistical nightmare for Ukraine’s forces to suddenly, immediately stop fighting at Putin’s behest. Some frontline positions may be in the middle of fierce clashes when this order comes through, and a cessation of this nature likely requires days of preparation and readiness.
Misinformation is bound to confuse troops about the truce’s implementation, how to report or respond to violations, and even what to do when it comes to an end.
It is possible this moment will prove a rare sign that both sides can stop violence for a short period. But it is significantly more likely they will both use violations and confusion to show their opponent cannot be trusted. As of Saturday evening local time, Ukrainian officials said Russian strikes had continued in frontline areas.
The ongoing 30-day truce limited to energy infrastructure was born in conditions of complete chaos. The White House announced that “energy and infrastructure” were covered, the Kremlin said they’d immediately stopped attacks on “energy infrastructure,” and Ukraine said the truce started a week later than the Kremlin did. Its execution has been equally mired in mistrust and accusations of breaches.
Moscow made a similar unilateral declaration in January 2023, calling for a day of peace to allow Orthodox Christians to observe Christmas – a move that Kyiv and Western leaders dismissed at the time as a strategic pause for military purposes.
A genuine truce requires negotiation with your opponent, and preparations for it to take hold. The sudden rush of this seems designed entirely to placate White House demands for some sign that Russia is willing to stop fighting. It will likely feed Trump’s at-times pro-Moscow framing of the conflict. It may also cause complexities for Ukraine when they are inevitably accused of violating what Washington may consider to be a goodwill gesture by Moscow.
Ultimately, this brief, likely theoretical, probably rhetorical and entirely unilateral stop to a three-year war is likely to do more damage to the role of diplomacy in the coming months than it does to support it.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/19/europe/trump-administration-crimea-peace-talks-intl/index.html,"Trump administration ready to recognize Russian control of Crimea as part of framework to end Ukraine war, source says",2024-10-02 00:00:00,"The Trump administration is ready to recognize Russian control of Crimea as part of the US proposal to drive an end to the war with Ukraine, an official familiar with the framework told CNN on Friday.
Crimea, southern Ukraine, has been under Russian occupation since it was illegally annexed in 2014. Four other Ukrainian regions - Donetsk and Luhansk in the east and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - have also been partially occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion in 2022.
There has been no immediate comment from Kyiv but the suggestion the US could recognize Russian control of Crimea is unlikely to be welcomed – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in March that his government would not recognize any occupied territories as Russian, calling that a “red line.”
Zelensky said at the time that the territories would “probably be one of the most sensitive and difficult issues” in peace negotiations, adding that, “for us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian. We will not go for it.”
The US proposal for an end to the war would also put a ceasefire in place along the front lines of the conflict, the source told CNN on Friday.
The framework was shared with the Europeans and the Ukrainians in Paris, France, on Thursday, the source said. It was also communicated to the Russians in a phone call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
Despite US President Donald Trump’s claim that he would be able to end the war in Ukraine in one day, American attempts to reach a peace agreement have largely stalled in the face of Russian intransigence, leading to a growing sense of frustration in the White House.
After Rubio warned Friday that the US was ready to “move on” from efforts to bring peace to Ukraine within days if there were no tangible signs of progress, Trump offered a less hardline approach, saying that Rubio was “right” but projecting more optimism about the prospects of a deal.
Pressed on a timeline for the US to walk away, Trump said: “No specific number of days, but quickly, we want to get it done.”
The source that spoke to CNN on Friday said that there are still pieces of the framework to be filled out, adding that the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that next week in London.
The Trump administration is simultaneously planning another meeting between Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the Russians to get Moscow on board with the framework, the source said.
UN alleges human rights abuses
Russia has imposed a brutal and repressive regime on Crimea and its people over the past 11 years, human rights observers say, stomping out any sign of opposition.
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has repeatedly reported on the human rights violations allegedly committed by Russia in occupied Crimea – from unlawful detentions, to sexual abuse and torture, to forcing people to send their children to Russian schools and training programs.
Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses, despite substantial evidence and victim testimonies.
Roughly 2.5 million people lived in Crimea before 2014 and many more would regularly visit the tourist hotspot, known for its beaches and nature reserves.
According to official data from the Ukrainian government, more than 64,000 have fled the peninsula to other parts of Ukraine since the annexation. However, Crimean NGOs estimate the number of refugees might be twice as high, as not everyone has officially registered with the government.
Meanwhile, Moscow has worked on its plan to “Russify” the peninsula. It put in place incentives to persuade Russian citizens to relocate to Crimea and the Ukrainian government estimated in 2023 that some 500,000 to 800,000 Russians had moved there permanently since it was annexed, with the number jumping sharply after the opening of the Kerch bridge that connects Crimea to Russia.
Maksym Vishchyk, a lawyer at Global Rights Compliance, a non-profit that advises the Ukrainian authorities on investigating and prosecuting international crimes, said Moscow has repeated the same pattern across other occupied territories.
“When Russia occupied the Crimean peninsula, it commenced a campaign of systematic targeting of communities or individuals it perceived as those who became an obstacle in the Russification campaign… with devastating effects on the social fabric in general, but also communities, families and individuals,” he told CNN in an interview last year.
“And Crimea has been kind of their playbook. Policies and patterns and tactics (Russia) applied in Crimea were then applied as well in other occupied territories. So, we see essentially the same patterns in all occupied territories, both since 2014 and since 2022.”","['Kylie Atwood', 'Catherine Nicholls']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/18/europe/rubio-russia-war-in-ukraine-us-talks-intl-hnk/index.html,"US will abandon Ukraine peace efforts ‘within days’ if no progress made, Rubio warns",2025-04-18 07:02:36,"The United States could end its efforts on ending the Ukrainian conflict within “days” if there are no signs of progress, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Friday.
“If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on,” he told reporters before departing Paris, where he had held high-level talks with European and Ukrainian officials. “We need to determine very quickly now, and I’m talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable,” he said.
Rubio’s comments point to mounting frustration within the Trump administration at the lack of progress at bringing the three-year full-scale war to a halt and come as the US has proposed a framework to drive an end to the conflict that includes the administration’s readiness to recognize Russian control of Crimea, according to an official familiar with the framework.
Later Friday, President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that Rubio was “right,” but he didn’t provide a timeline for the US to walk away when pressed. “No specific number of days, but quickly, we want to get it done.”
Asked to clarify what Rubio meant that the US would “move on,” a US official told CNN the secretary of state was talking about the US moving on from negotiations and that the next few days will be important to figure out where things go from here.
A source familiar with negotiations for a Ukraine peace deal told CNN’s Pamela Brown that Rubio was “communicating the president’s views.” Characterizing the administration’s thinking on where things stand in the conflict, the source said, Trump “doesn’t have limitless patience for people to posture and play games.”
“It’s time to get serious,” the source added.
Trump expressed that view on Friday, saying, “If, for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say, ‘You’re foolish, you’re foolish. You’re horrible people,’ and we’re just going to take a pass — but hopefully we won’t have to do that.”
Trump declined to say whether he is prepared to walk away completely from the talks or whether he would support Ukraine militarily if talks fall through.
Asked what progress he would need to see to continue negotiations, Trump said he would “have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it” from both sides, predicting he would know “soon.”
A broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in this short timeframe. Rubio said it would be taken by the Ukrainians back to Zelensky to discuss, and it was raised between Rubio and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on a call on Thursday.
The Trump administration is ready to recognize Russian control of Crimea as part of the proposal, the official familiar with the framework said, which would be a win for President Vladimir Putin after Russia illegally annexed the territory from Ukraine in 2014. The proposal would also put a ceasefire in place along the frontlines of the war, the official said.
There are still pieces of the framework to be filled out and the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that next week in London, the person said. The Trump administration is simultaneously planning another meeting between Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Russia to get Moscow on board with the framework, the source said.
If there’s no movement, the US official said, the administration will have to make significant policy decisions. Trump has threatened secondary sanctions and tariffs on Russia. But he has also said the US won’t continue to fund Ukraine indefinitely and that Europe needs to step up, the US official noted.
Moscow has stalled on negotiations and rejected a ceasefire proposal agreed by Kyiv. Having promised on the campaign trail to end the fighting in a day, Trump more recently said “Russia has to get moving.”
The Kremlin said Friday that Russia was “striving to settle this conflict.”
“The contacts are quite complicated because the topic of Ukrainian settlement is also not simple,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Responding to a question on Rubio’s remark, Peskov acknowledged the progress already made in talks. “Certain developments already exist, but of course there are still many difficult discussions ahead,” he said.
Elsewhere, Evgeny Popov, a well-known face on Russian state TV and Duma representative, described Rubio’s comments as Washington issuing an “ultimatum” to Kyiv.
Despite US officials holding talks with Ukrainian and European counterparts on Thursday in what the State Department touted as an “excellent exchange,” and progress being made toward a landmark minerals deal between Washington and Kyiv, peace still feels out of reach. Meanwhile, a partial ceasefire on energy infrastructure brokered by the US came to an end on Thursday, an agreement both sides frequently accused each other of violating.
Vance ‘optimistic’ about negotiations
Vice President JD Vance said hours after Rubio’s comments that the Trump administration feels “optimistic” they will ultimately be able to successfully negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.
“I want to update the prime minister on some of the negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and also some of the things that have happened even in the past 24 hours,” Vance said in Rome during a bilateral meeting with Italy Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
He continued, “I think we have some interesting things to report on, of course, in private, some negotiations. I won’t prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close.”
A US-authored outline of a peace plan had received an “encouraging reception” at the talks in the French capital on Thursday, according to a State Department readout, which did not give details on the outline. Rubio also spoke with Lavrov and conveyed the same outline, the readout said.
Speaking Friday, Rubio said he and Witkoff had come to Paris to “begin to talk about more specific outlines of what it might take to end the war” and whether or not this is a war that can be ended.
“If it’s not possible, if we’re so far apart that this is not going to happen then I think the president is probably at a point where he’s going to say we’re done,” he said.
“It’s not our war. We didn’t start it. The United States has been helping Ukraine for the past three years and we want it to end, but it’s not our war,” he added.
Meanwhile, Russia launched a missile attack on Ukraine overnight, hitting a residential neighborhood of the city of Kharkiv. The strike killed one person and wounded 67 others, authorities said Friday, adding they feared more people could be trapped beneath the rubble of a damaged apartment building.
Step towards minerals deal
Rubio’s words of warning on Friday come after the US and Ukraine moved closer toward clinching an agreement on a minerals deal on Thursday night.
Kyiv and Washington have now signed a memorandum as a move towards the proposed agreement, Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said.
“We are happy to announce the signing, with our American partners, of a Memorandum of Intent, which paves the way for an Economic Partnership Agreement and the establishment of the Investment Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine,” Svyrydenko said in a post on X.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had said earlier Thursday that a memorandum related to the deal could be signed remotely that day.
“This document is the result of the professional work of the negotiating teams, which recently completed another round of technical discussions in Washington,” Svyrydenko continued. “Ahead is the finalization of the text of the agreement and its signing — and then, ratification by parliaments.”
“There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries,” Svyrydenko concluded.
An earlier iteration of the minerals deal went unsigned following a public argument between Zelensky and Trump in February.
Details of the proposed deal have since been in flux, with Treasury officials meeting a Ukrainian delegation in Washington this week to hammer it out, sources told CNN.

“If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after meeting European and Ukrainian officials for talks in Paris.
For President Donald Trump, who swept into office convinced he possessed the skills to quickly end the gravest conflict in Europe since the World War II, there is immense frustration with the lack of progress.
“The President has spent 87 days at the highest level of this government repeatedly taking efforts to bring this war to an end,” Rubio added, as the bloodshed in the war zone continues unabated.
So what would to “move on” look like?
One option might be redouble US military support for Ukraine. Despite Trump’s efforts to court the Kremlin, or perhaps because of them, Russian intransigence has emerged as the main obstacle to peace, such as Moscow’s foot-dragging over Trump’s proposed 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine alone has agreed.
Admittedly, fresh deliveries of billions of dollars more of American arms to Ukraine may be an unpopular policy U-turn among some Trump supporters, but a newly invigorated Ukrainian push-back on the battlefield could encourage the Kremlin to reassess its negotiating position.
New, properly tough US sanctions on Russian oil and gas, and those who buy it, have also been touted as a potential means of applying maximum pressure on Moscow.
Problem is, forging a peace in Ukraine is just one of the agenda items in what Trump and the Kremlin see as a much broader, lucrative reconfiguration of US-Russian relations – involving energy deals, space exploration and mining contracts – which Trump may be reluctant to jeopardize.
Back in Paris, Rubio hinted at a possible second, more likely, option.
“It’s not our war. We didn’t start it. The United States has been helping Ukraine for the past three years and we want it to end, but it’s not our war,” Rubio stressed, alluding to the possibility that the US could simply walk away, leaving Ukraine and its European backers to face Russia alone.
That would pose a huge challenge, given Ukraine’s depleted resources and Europe’s dire unreadiness, currently, to bolster the front lines with sufficient military supplies of its own.
For the Kremlin, American disengagement is a double-edged sword. It may give its battered forces a freer hand in Ukraine, but it doesn’t necessarily deliver the win that Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, insists that he wants, instead dragging out the pain.
Russian troops, who are being killed and injured at an alarming rate, would continue to be fed into the brutal “meat grinder” of the Ukrainian front lines, increasing simmering social pressure on the Kremlin at home.
Pressure on the Russian economy, already weakened by war, would also increase. If there is no peace deal, there is unlikely to be any easing of the punitive international sanctions already straining fragile Russian finances.
Putin, bent on total victory, may regret passing up the extraordinary chance offered by Trump to end his disastrous Ukraine war and cut his country’s substantial losses.
The Trump administration insists it has not yet entirely given up – just hours after Rubio’s comment, Vice President JD Vance said the White House was “optimistic” it could still end the war – but is signalling that that point may be drawing close.
“We need to determine very quickly now, and I’m talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable,” Rubio said of peace in Ukraine before heading back to Washington.
The Kremlin is also engaging in the brinkmanship, its spokesman insisting “there are no contacts planned for this week, but, on the other hand, let’s say that the established contacts allow us to very, very quickly agree on such a conversation if necessary.”
There is, it seems, still a narrow scope for a face-saving, last minute breakthrough. But time and patience in Washington to end the war in Ukraine seems to be rapidly running out.",['Matthew Chance'],en

Ukrainian and US officials had an “excellent exchange” with their British, French and German counterparts, according to a source at France’s Elysée Palace, with the meetings providing “a very strong strategic opportunity.”
A US-authored outline of a peace plan had received an “encouraging reception” at the talks, according to a State Department readout, which did not give details on the outline.
Following the talks, Rubio spoke with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and conveyed the same outline, the readout said.
“President Trump and the United States want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace,” it said.
Ukraine and the three US allies stressed their shared support for Trump’s efforts to bring about a rapid end to the war, according to the Elysée source.
For Ukraine’s European allies, the summit offered a chance to gauge the Trump administration’s thinking on the war in Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies have been alarmed by Trump’s and Witkoff’s parroting of Kremlin talking points, and may have viewed the talks as a chance to disrupt and dislodge those perceptions.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky – who was not at the Paris talks – repeated criticism of Witkoff on Thursday, accusing him of “spreading Russian narratives,” according to Reuters.
More meetings will take place next week in London in the same format, the source added. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce would not say whether Rubio would attend the discussions.
French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday’s talks marked “a day of diplomatic mobilisation,” in a post on social media.
“Today, we engaged in a positive and constructive discussion on how to achieve both a ceasefire and a comprehensive, lasting peace,” Macron said.
Elsewhere, Trump told reporters Thursday that the United States would be “hearing” from Moscow “this week” on the US proposal for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.
“We’re going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually, and we’ll see. But we want it to stop. We want the death and the killing to stop,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office.
Trump added that while he is not a “big fan” of Zelensky, he does not hold the Ukrainian leader responsible for the war.
“I don’t hold Zelensky responsible, but I’m not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. That was a war that would have never started if I were president,” Trump told reporters.
If Trump’s pledge to end the war in a day was far-fetched, the hope to secure a full truce by Easter – this weekend – also looks likely to fail. Russia has ramped up its strikes on Ukraine in recent weeks, despite Washington’s overtures to Moscow.
After meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin for a third time last week, Witkoff told Fox News that any peace deal in Ukraine will center on the “so-called five territories,” referring to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, and the four mainland Ukrainian regions Russia has occupied since its full-scale invasion in 2022, having previously suggested Ukraine may have to cede them under a truce.
Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, told CNN Tuesday that Witkoff “with all due respect… may be inadvertently trying to push pro-Russian narratives.”
A ‘deal’ proves elusive
Despite its ambitious pledges, the Trump administration has struggled to broker a lasting peace deal between the warring countries, and has been accused of using mostly sticks in its dealing with Ukraine while saving its carrots for Russia.
After the White House briefly cut weapons supplies and intelligence sharing to Ukraine in March, Kyiv swiftly agreed to the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.
Following separate talks with Russian and Ukrainian officials later that month, the White House said both had agreed to the ceasefire on energy infrastructure and in the Black Sea – only for the Kremlin to announce it would only implement the agreement when sanctions imposed on its banks and exports are lifted.
The Center for Countering Disinformation, a Ukrainian think-tank, has pointed out that the supposed truce has done little to constrain Russia’s aggression. In the 22 days after the truce, the Russian army killed nearly 2.5 times more Ukrainians than during the same period before it was announced, the center said in an update Tuesday.
In a sign of growing irritation with Moscow, Trump last week said that “Russia has to get moving,” but provided no deadlines or ultimatum if it did not.
While the Paris summit was underway, Kirill Dmitriev, a top Russian negotiator, claimed that many countries are trying to “disrupt” Russia’s dialogue with the US. He said Putin’s latest meeting with Witkoff was “extremely productive,” but that the dialogue was taking place in “very difficult conditions – constant attacks, constant disinformation.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam/index.html,What message was Ukraine trying to send by parading Chinese nationals captured fighting for Russia?,2025-04-16 19:16:19,"Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.
But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.
There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.
China has always claimed neutrality in Russia’s war on Ukraine and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. All the same, as a key diplomatic and economic lifeline for Moscow, Beijing’s actions are watched closely in Kyiv.
Dressed in combat fatigues and answering questions in Mandarin, the POWs were watched over by armed Ukrainian security personnel, while a translator sat beside them.
The men – who CNN are not naming, nor identifying in any way – told how financial incentives played a key role in their stories.
One said he had been looking for a way to earn money after losing his job during the coronavirus pandemic. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.
As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.
Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood. One said that he communicated mainly through hand signals.
CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.
The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. Lasting a year, it commits the volunteer, among other things, to “participate in combat, fulfill duties during the mobilization period… emergencies and martial law,” as well as take part in “activity to keep and restore international peace and security” and stopping “international terrorist activity outside the territory of the Russian Federation.”
Once they reached the battlefield, instruction there was also non-verbal. One of the men recounted the chaotic moments that lead up to their capture in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. But I did not know where the target was. We passed many Russian positions, and I thought we were heading toward our own bunker. I thought he was joking, so I hid. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”
The men surrendered. They had been fighting for only three days.
The role of foreign fighters
Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.
A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.
In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.
A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.
“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.
Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.
Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.
“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”
But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.
The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.
One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.
It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.
It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.
Why the timing matters
Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.
The timing is important.
It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President Donald Trump, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.
Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.
From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.
But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.
Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.
“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.
“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.
Beijing certainly saw it like that.
“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.","['Andrew Carey', 'Victoria Butenko']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/14/europe/ukraine-sumy-trump-russia-intl/index.html,Trump calls Sumy missile strike a ‘mistake.’ But Russia’s war seems to be raging on exactly to Putin’s plan,2025-04-14 14:46:31,"“I was told they made a mistake.” This is the way US President Donald Trump characterized Russia’s “horrific” double-tap missile strike on central Sumy, Ukraine, on Saturday, which allegedly used cluster munitions to maximize casualties.
The Iskander missiles reportedly utilized are accurate, and the use of two of them could suggest a degree of purpose and malice, aimed at hitting first responders too as they rush in. It is unlikely the Kremlin saw the error of its ways - this tactic being now so common - and perhaps a sympathizer is instead excusing Russia to the US president.
The weekend’s strike was, to Ukraine’s allies, a gruesome reminder of Moscow’s true intent in its invasion: to terrify Ukrainians into submission. The target, Sumy, is also in Russia’s immediate crosshairs, as President Vladimir Putin claims to seek a buffer zone inside of Ukraine by pounding this thriving border city.
The attack also placed unwelcome emphasis on just how little fruit the White House’s relentless pursuit of diplomacy has borne. Trump said Friday on social media that Russia had to “get moving,” but provided no deadlines or explicit consequences if it did not, although secondary tariffs on its oil purchasers have been floated.
Trump has made similar comments before – admonishing Moscow for its onslaught on Ukraine’s civilians, while also expressing broader grief at the tragedy of war in general, rather than fury at the Kremlin’s specific massacres, say of nine children at a Kryvyi Rih playground days earlier.
Indeed, he later reached for what seems to be his comfort talking points. When seemingly cornered on the issue, Trump suggested - erroneously - Ukraine had in fact started the war. “Listen, when you start a war, you gotta know that you can win the war, right? You don’t start a war with someone who’s 20 times your size and then hope people give you some missiles,” he said, answering a question about Kyiv’s urgent requests for more Patriot missile defense systems.
The truth Trump may be reluctant to post about is that Russia’s diplomacy has predictably dissolved into a dizzying Catherine wheel of tangents. It generates the requisite light and noise, but is of little consequence, bar Moscow continuing to buy time and prosecute the war on its own terms.
American and Russian diplomats are now on a carousel of Moscow’s apparent design, with multiple tracks leaving scant chance of real progress. Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff intermittently flies to Russia, to presumably hear demands direct from the Kremlin, whose official called his Friday visit to St Petersburg “productive.” Higher-level American and Russian diplomats meet in Saudi Arabia to float ceasefire ideas and a wider detente, while lower-level diplomatic meetings began in the new venue of Turkey last week to address the technical details of embassies reopening.
And there is more. The Americans and Ukrainians have been hammering out in Washington a viable way forward from a dense and corporate rare-earth minerals contract, drawn up (and perhaps only understood) by Delaware corporate lawyers, which seems, according to the last draft seen by CNN, to be almost entirely in the White House’s favor.
And there is a separate diplomatic US-Ukraine track over peace, also in Saudi Arabia, that has so far proposed a wide-ranging ceasefire that Russia has yet to agree to. Instead, a limited 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire – chaotically birthed and barely adhered to – ends on Friday. This first test of diplomacy, seemingly dead on arrival, is somehow yet to cast future endeavors as problematic.
The above flow chart, or lapsed Venn diagram, has the singular unifying thread of the Trump administration seeking progress from multiple different dialogues it hopes will eventually congeal into a singular lasting peace. Five different, current conversations, and that is even if you don’t count the mostly silent role of Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia Gen. Keith Kellogg, or the intermittent but overarching influence that Putin-Trump phone calls take.
This disparate and confusing interface is, Moscow’s critics say, a standard Russian tactic to buy time while appearing engaged. The Trump administration brimmed with 24-hour to 100-day deadlines about peace prior to the rubber hitting the road. Now there is no deadline – or end to the metastasizing talks – in sight.
Why does Putin seek time? Because he believes Trump has been proven to be easily distracted and is interested in an easy win, but not a complex compromise. Putin also clearly believes this summer he can win a tangible victory on the front lines that will change the dynamic in talks.
His onslaught on Sumy is intended to buy Russia space on the border, but also drag Ukraine’s forces in. Russia is making slow yet discomforting progress to the south of Zaporizhzhia, an area where nearly two years ago its counteroffensive was meant to have broken through. One Ukrainian intelligence officer recently moved to near the city of Kharkiv described a front line quieter than expected, and anxiety as to what lies ahead.
Concerns are growing that Russia is amassing reinforcements, waiting for the ground to dry in May to escalate a spring offensive that Ukrainian officials say has already partially begun. Kyiv has hinted at an artillery ammunition shortage in the weeks ahead, and recent pledges by its allies may not have headed off that imminent crisis. It is going to be a very difficult summer for Ukraine.
This is the real rubber hitting the road. Moscow has invested all in a war in which it simply cannot afford anything less than victory. It does not see gain in forging a deal over frozen front lines now. The momentum – with a White House tearing up economic and security norms by the sheaf, and Ukraine struggling to meet manpower and resource needs – is day by day more in its favor. The Russians are stalling for time as they believe it is on their side.
Their European allies are disconcertingly readying for two unpleasant potential futures. The first is the possibility of a Ukrainian collapse and the need for NATO’s European members to hold back the Russians without American assistance. This is a more remote likelihood, but the undertone of preparations across the continent. The second possibility is more feasible and public: the British and French are spearheading preparations for a “reassurance force” to protect any ceasefire. The noise, and planning, serves two purposes: it allows Kyiv to agree to diplomacy knowing it has some security guarantees in place. And it partially embarrasses Moscow into stonewalling a peace plan that is increasingly ready to roll.
But with each rotation of the diplomatic Catherine wheel, the terms of actual peace become more dizzying. Putin seems less willing to offer even a partial pause as he believes ultimately Trump is toothless and will not punish him effectively for refusing this détente.
Trump said of US talks with Russia and Ukraine at the weekend: “You know, there’s a point at which you have to either put up or shut up.” His problem is that both he and the Kremlin are happy to keep talking. And neither wants to put up either: Trump is reluctant to impose harsh sanctions and disrupt his relationship with Moscow, and the Kremlin seems to have no desire to stop the war.
Trump added: “We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s going fine.” Ukraine must be left hoping he does not mean simply that the country’s fate will be permanently eclipsed by another crisis.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/europe/ukraine-russia-chinese-nationals-intl-latam/index.html,What message was Ukraine trying to send by parading Chinese nationals captured fighting for Russia?,2025-04-16 19:16:19,"Putting prisoners of war in front of reporters and news cameras is almost certainly a violation of international humanitarian law.
But Ukraine clearly felt any reputational damage it might suffer by doing so in a news conference this week would be outweighed by the fact that it featured two alleged captured fighters from China.
There was more value in giving them a platform to speak, the argument presumably ran, than protecting them “against insult and public curiosity” – something the International Committee of the Red Cross says includes protection from the media.
China has always claimed neutrality in Russia’s war on Ukraine and repeatedly tells its citizens not to get involved in foreign conflicts. All the same, as a key diplomatic and economic lifeline for Moscow, Beijing’s actions are watched closely in Kyiv.
Dressed in combat fatigues and answering questions in Mandarin, the POWs were watched over by armed Ukrainian security personnel, while a translator sat beside them.
The men – who CNN are not naming, nor identifying in any way – told how financial incentives played a key role in their stories.
One said he had been looking for a way to earn money after losing his job during the coronavirus pandemic. The prospect of 250,000 rubles (around $3,000) per month in Russia was more than double what he could expect to earn at home.
As someone with experience in medical rehabilitation, he said he told the recruiter he wanted to do the same with the Russian military. But when he got to Moscow, he was forced into training for a combat role.
Documents were only in Russian, which neither man said they understood. One said that he communicated mainly through hand signals.
CNN has seen a Russian military contract signed by a separate Chinese fighter which gives a possible indication of what the two POWs had agreed to.
The contract, which was shown to CNN by a Ukrainian intelligence source, is written in Russian. Lasting a year, it commits the volunteer, among other things, to “participate in combat, fulfill duties during the mobilization period… emergencies and martial law,” as well as take part in “activity to keep and restore international peace and security” and stopping “international terrorist activity outside the territory of the Russian Federation.”
Once they reached the battlefield, instruction there was also non-verbal. One of the men recounted the chaotic moments that lead up to their capture in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
“When we reached a forest, my captain told me, ‘Da, da, da’ (“Yes, yes, yes” in Russian), signaling me to start the attack. But I did not know where the target was. We passed many Russian positions, and I thought we were heading toward our own bunker. I thought he was joking, so I hid. Then I saw the captain of (another Russian unit) throw in a grenade, and suddenly there were (Ukrainian) drones everywhere.”
The men surrendered. They had been fighting for only three days.
The role of foreign fighters
Foreign fighters have been a part of this war – on both sides – since the beginning.
A list seen by CNN showing non-Russian POWs held by Ukraine as of the end of 2024 showed six Sri Lankan nationals, seven from Nepal, plus individuals from Somalia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Egypt and Syria, as well as about a dozen from former Soviet republics.
In January, Ukraine also captured two North Koreans, part of an estimated force of about 14,000 troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow’s war effort.
A source at Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN that Russia needed its foreign fighters because it was now locked into a war of attrition.
“It is unable to maintain the long front line with its own soldiers alone and is taking every opportunity to recruit whoever it can,” the source said.
Since the announcement of the Chinese men’s capture last week – which was followed by Ukraine declaring it had information on a further 155 Chinese citizens fighting for Russia – considerable interest has focused on how they were recruited and whether China’s government had played an active role in some way.
Certainly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did nothing to tamp down such speculation when asked by reporters whether he thought the presence of Chinese nationals in Ukraine was the result of official Beijing policy.
“I don’t have an answer to this question yet. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on it,” he said last week, adding, “We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.”
But Zelensky went on to say that Kyiv believed that Beijing was aware of what was happening.
The POWs were at pains to indicate otherwise, both saying that they were acting as individuals, pointing to slick recruitment videos posted to TikTok as the source of their inspiration.
One such clip has been circulating on Chinese social media networks for more than a year and appears to have originally been created for a domestic Russian audience, with Chinese subtitles added later.
It shows what appear to be Russian soldiers training and dressed in combat fatigues in the field. “You’re a man, be a man,” it says in Russian, alongside Chinese subtitles, which also explain the payments on offer for signing up.
It is impossible to say if the subtitles were added by an official entity or by social media users, but one of the men said the videos resonated in China, where military prowess is highly prized, but opportunities for direct combat experience are rare.
Why the timing matters
Though Ukraine has hosted news conferences with POWs previously, including one involving combatants from Nepal and several African countries, its decision to platform its Chinese POWs is still unusual.
The timing is important.
It comes amid Kyiv’s attempts to get the upper hand in its battle with Moscow for the ear of US President Donald Trump, whose administration appears to be making little headway in its efforts to convince the Kremlin to agree to a full ceasefire.
Washington has also been heavily focused on China, which some in the White House see as the United States’ main global adversary, and which the administration has been hitting with progressively larger import tariffs.
From Zelensky’s perspective, there is a clear interest in amplifying anything that suggests China’s support for Russia might be more than diplomatic and economic.
But it might not just be the US that Ukraine’s leader is sending a message to.
Anders Puck Nielsen of the Royal Danish Defence College believes Kyiv is also anxious about recent European Union overtures to China, as the two economic powerhouses look for possible joint solutions in the face of Trump’s trade wars.
“Suddenly it seems there might be potential for the Europeans and the Chinese to find common ground on other questions as well,” Nielsen told CNN.
“It has clearly been a political move to really emphasize this aspect (of Chinese fighters in the Russian army),” he added.
Beijing certainly saw it like that.
“We urge the relevant parties concerned to correctly and soberly understand the role of China and to not release irresponsible remarks,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, without mentioning names.","['Andrew Carey', 'Victoria Butenko']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/europe/russian-strike-sumy-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Russian strikes on Ukrainian city of Sumy kill 35, in deadliest attack this year",2025-04-13 00:00:00,"Russian ballistic missiles ripped through the busy center of Ukraine’s northeastern city of Sumy on Sunday, officials said, killing at least 35 people and striking terror into residents who were out enjoying Palm Sunday and attending morning church services.
It was the deadliest attack of the conflict this year. Two children were among the scores of people killed in the strikes on the city’s center, while 117 people were wounded, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the strikes were carried out by ballistic missiles; one hit a university building and another “exploded right over (a) street,” he said.
Zelensky also called for a “strong response from the world” to the attack, which came two days after top Trump administration official Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, with video showing the two warmly shaking hands before a four hour meeting.
Ukrainian officials said that preliminary information indicates cluster munitions were used in the attack. The second of the two explosions was described as being likely filled with munitions that “exploded mid-air to inflict maximum damage on people,” according to the head of the region’s military administration.
“Russia wants exactly this kind of terror and is dragging out this war,” Zelensky said. “Without pressure on the aggressor, peace is impossible. Talking has never stopped ballistic missiles and bombs. We need to treat Russia as a terrorist deserves.”
When asked about the attack, Moscow maintained that the Russian military “strikes exclusively at military and near-military targets.”
“I can only repeat and remind you of the repeated statements of both our president (Vladimir Putin) and our army representatives,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.
The attacks targeted Ukrainian commanding officers, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said on Telegram. It claimed that Kyiv “continues to use the Ukrainian population as a human shield” by “holding events with the participation of military personnel in the center of a densely populated city.”
International condemnation of the strikes from Ukraine’s allies was swift.
The Trump administration’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg questioned the targeting of the attack, which he said “crosses any line of decency.”
US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said he was told Russia “made a mistake.”
“I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it’s a horrible thing,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday. When asked to elaborate on Monday, Trump said: “the mistake was letting the war happen.”
While he acknowledged that Putin started the war against Ukraine, he also continued to cast blame on Zelensky and former US President Joe Biden. “When you start a war you got to know that you can win the war,” Trump said referring to Zelensky. “You don’t start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles.”
Strikes on Palm Sunday
The strikes hit the city center on Palm Sunday as residents were attending church services on one of the busiest church-going days of the year, according to Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko.
Natalia Pihul, a 52-year-old Sumy resident, told Reuters that her mother was hospitalized after suffering a head injury.
“(My mother) was in the kitchen cooking some food, lunch … A cupboard was right here, now it lies here on the floor. It fell and its doors cut her head,” she said as she walked around her mother’s damaged apartment.
The explosion blew out the unit’s window frames, scattering glass shards all across the kitchen and living room. Outside the building, footage from Reuters showed charred vehicles next to piles of rubble and personal belongings littering the street.
“Where is a military base here? Where is it? Please have a look. A woman lived here. Look at this! How is this even possible? It is unacceptable,” Pihul said.
A total of 20 buildings were damaged, including apartments, cafes, shops and the district court, Zelensky later wrote on X.
Of the more than 100 people wounded in the attack, he said 68 were in hospitals, eight of whom were in serious condition.
Volodymyr Artyukh, head of the military administration in the region, said that “at that time, a lot of people were on the street.”
“The enemy was hoping to inflict the greatest damage on people in the city of Sumy,” Artyuk added.
The attack is also the worst single attack on Ukrainian civilians since 2023, when 51 people were killed in strikes on Kupiansk.
Footage from the scene shows destroyed buildings, blown-out windows and piles of rubble in the Sumy city center. Bodies covered in emergency blankets can be seen on the ground.
Cluster munitions used, say Ukrainian officials
Cluster munitions contain multiple explosives that are released over a wide area – up to the size of several football fields – and are particularly dangerous to civilians when fired near populated areas.
“A missile with cluster munitions is something Russians do to kill as many civilians as possible,” said Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, calling the strike a “deliberate targeting of civilians.”
It was a two-pronged attack, with the second of two missiles likely filled with munitions that “exploded mid-air to inflict maximum damage on people” and caused large numbers of casualties, the head of the region’s military administration said. The second explosion happened about 200 meters from the site of the first, hitting an area with residential buildings, educational institutions and shops.
Sumy resident Iryna Pryykhodko told Reuters that the “first explosion was strong, but the second one was even stronger.”
“First, I saw shattered windows. Then, before the second strike, we took cover inside the residential building,” she said. “After the second strike, it was all covered with smoke and I could not see anything.”
Among those killed was Olena Kohut, an artist with the Sumy National Theatre’s orchestra, who died from her injuries in the attack. Liudmyla Hordiienko, a deputy head in the region’s state tax service, was also killed.
CNN has verified social media videos of the moment the strike hit Sumy. A loud noise can be heard as large plumes of black smoke rise in the air.
Video shared by the region’s military administration also registers a loud boom, showing the moment a Russian missile hit a building. Emergency sirens can be heard as people run in panic, while others can be seen lying on the ground.
The face of one woman being helped is covered in blood in a different video shared by Zelensky. Footage also shows body bags on the ground and a blown-out trolleybus that appears to have bodies inside, as emergency workers respond to the attack.
Artyukh, the head of the military administration, later said that most people on the trolleybus were killed.
Global condemnation
Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, called the incident a “horrific example of Russia intensifying attacks while Ukraine has accepted an unconditional ceasefire.” French President Emmanuel Macron also reacted, saying “strong measures” are needed to impose a ceasefire.
“It’s been two months since Putin ignored America’s proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire,” Zelensky said Sunday, referring to Ukraine’s acceptance of a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States in March, which Russia refused.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio extended condolences to victims of the “horrifying Russian missile attack.”
Speaking to CBS News’ “60 Minutes” in an interview published Sunday, Zelensky said he believes that “Russian narratives are prevailing in the US.”
“How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians are doing, and to still believe that they are not the aggressors, that they did not start this war?” he said.
“This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia’s information policy on America, on US politics, and US politicians.”
The UN’s Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine Matthias Schmale condemned the strike on Sumy’s city center “in the strongest possible terms” and noted that international humanitarian law “strictly prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure.”
Russia has increased air attacks and missile strikes on the Sumy region in recent weeks as it has pushed Ukrainian forces out of much of the adjoining Russian territory of Kursk. Its forces have also occupied a few small settlements just inside the Sumy region.
Over the past 24 hours, other Russian attacks in Ukraine’s Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kherson regions killed eight people and wounded at least 18.

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Ukraine
A Russian airstrike on a city in northeastern Ukraine was the deadliest attack of the conflict this year. At least 34 people, including two children, died on Palm Sunday when ballistic missiles ripped through the busy center of Sumy as residents were attending church services. At least 117 others were wounded and 20 buildings were damaged during the assault. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a “strong response from the world” to the attack, which came just two days after a Trump administration official met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said the attack “crosses any line of decency.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the airstrikes as “horrifying.” And President Donald Trump said he was told Russia “made a mistake.”
2. Pennsylvania arson
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with an arson attack on the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion in Harrisburg. Over the weekend, someone jumped the iron fence surrounding the property, “forcibly entered” the building and set it on fire before fleeing. As Pennsylvania State Police were searching for the arsonist, troopers woke Gov. Josh Shapiro around 2 a.m. so that he, his wife, their four children, two dogs and another family could be evacuated. Although no one was injured, parts of the building were devastated by the blaze. A motive for the attack is not yet known. Police arrested Cody Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg, about 12 hours later. Dauphin County district attorney said he plans to charge Balmer with attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person. On Saturday night, the first night of Passover, Shapiro posted a photo on social media of the family’s Seder dinner. The fire was set in the same room where the dinner was held, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
3. Deportations
A federal judge last week ordered US officials to “take all available steps to facilitate” the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. But in court filings Sunday, the Trump administration insisted it is not required to work with officials in El Salvador to secure the release of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was deported on March 15 and is being held in the notorious Cecot mega-prison even though an immigration judge barred his deportation years ago over concerns about his safety in his native country. “The federal courts have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner,” the DOJ attorneys wrote. The Trump administration has previously conceded in court that the father of three was deported due to “an administrative error.”
4. Social Security
The Department of Homeland Security reportedly requested that the Social Security Administration add the names of more than 6,000 living immigrants to its database of dead Americans. The move, which was first reported in The New York Times, aims to cut off their ability to legally work in the US, receive benefits or access credit and bank accounts that require an active Social Security number. A DHS official told CNN the Trump administration hopes that by adding these names to the Social Security Death Master file — which DOGE leaders have since renamed the “Ineligible file” — the immigrants will decide to self-deport. When Greg Pearce, who oversaw the IT staff at the SSA, pushed back on the move, he was escorted out of the building, The Washington Post reported. “If they can, contrary to the law and every regulation and without any due process, mark people inside SSA’s database dead who legally entered the country and were legally required to be issued a work SSA number, then they can do that to anybody,” former Social Security commissioner Martin O’Malley said.
5. Helicopter crash
The tour company whose sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson River off the New Jersey shoreline last week has shut down its operations, the FAA said on Sunday. Siemens executive Agustín Escobar, his wife and their three children were just 16 minutes into the tour above Manhattan last Thursday afternoon when the aircraft suddenly dropped from the sky and slammed into the river upside down. The pilot, former Navy SEAL Seankese Johnson, also perished. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation. The FAA plans to launch a review of New York Helicopter Tours’ license and safety record as well.

Oh no, he didn’t!
Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout had it. On Saturday night, he leaped into the air to catch Houston Astros Yainer Díaz’s fly ball to right field — when a fan ripped the ball right out of his glove. Although the Angels still won, Trout kindly met with the Astros fan after the game. “They were really apologetic,” Trout said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/world/ukraine-life-under-russian-occupation-trumps-peace-talks/index.html,Ukrainians living under Russian occupation fear Trump’s peace talks,2025-04-07 00:00:00,"Asked why she and other Ukrainian people choose to keep living under Russian occupation instead of fleeing, the woman paused for a moment.
“I don’t know how to explain the feeling,” she said. “It’s like you just can’t believe that evil could win. Even after three years, people can’t believe that this is it. They still believe that the occupation will end. That’s why they are still staying here and not running away.”
The woman, a member of the all-female resistance group Zla Mavka, lives in a city in southeastern Ukraine that fell under Russian control just days after Moscow launched its full-scale, unprovoked invasion of the country in February 2022.
Zla Mavka – which translates as Angry Mavka, Mavka being a female forest spirit in Ukrainian folklore – engages only in non-violent activities. But taking part in any form of protest and speaking to Western media is extremely dangerous, which is why CNN is not publishing the woman’s name or location.
She told CNN that life under Russian occupation is exhausting and incredibly scary.
“You can be arrested for anything. You have to worry about everything. You have to check your phone, you have to check what you have in your apartment, you have to hide a lot of things, you can’t say what you’re thinking and you cannot trust anyone,” she said.
US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he wants the war in Ukraine to end, even if it means further territorial losses for Kyiv. Trump has said it was “unlikely” Ukraine would get all of its pre-war territory back, saying: “(Russia) took a lot of land, and they fought for that land, and they lost a lot of soldiers.”
This could include the Zla Mavka woman’s hometown.
“People abroad always talk about territories, and they forget, maybe, that it’s not only about territories. It’s about people. And people here are still waiting. People have not moved, and they don’t want to move. And why (should) they have to move from their homes?” the woman said.
Russian forces currently occupy nearly a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, home to about 6 million people, including 1 million children, who are living in what the United Nations has described as a “bleak human rights situation.”
Stepan, a 22-year-old Ukrainian man who recently escaped from an occupied area in southern Ukraine to Kherson, which is under Kyiv’s control, has experienced firsthand what the occupying forces are capable of.
Stepan and his parents were detained by Russian troops in summer 2022. He was held for two weeks and repeatedly beaten and tortured with electricity. His parents were held for several more months.
None of the family was ever told why they were being detained. They have never been convicted or charged with any crimes.
When Stepan was released, he was separated from the rest of his family. He ended up on the left bank of the Dnipro River, which is still occupied by Russia. His mother Olha managed to escape to a government-controlled area after she was released in spring 2023.
“I was very afraid,” Stepan said of his time living under occupation. “Whenever I went outside, I looked around to see if they were there to take me away again or do something to me. I wouldn’t leave the house if I didn’t have to. It was like that every day,” he told CNN.
Stepan was lucky – he managed to escape and was reunited with his family last month. He was brought back thanks to a “coordinated effort” that involved the “Angels,” a Ukrainian special forces unit that rescues vulnerable people from occupied territories, according to Roman Mrochko, the head of Kherson City Military Administration. Stepan and his family said they were not allowed to share details of the operation.
Dire consequences
Both Stepan and the Zla Mavka member said that even the slightest suspicion of being “pro-Ukrainian” can have dire consequences for people living under occupation.
“My friends and acquaintances were often taken away because they did not want to get a Russian passport or for not registering for military service. They were taken away and brought back a week later with broken arms and legs, sometime heads. There were many, we are talking about dozens of people,” Stepan said.
Human rights groups say that Moscow has intensified its campaign to “Russify” occupied Ukraine in recent months, likely to stake claim to the areas in any future peace negotiation.
“They try to remove anything Ukrainian from our city, from the language to traditions,” the Zla Mavka woman said, adding that the group has made it one of its missions to keep Ukrainian culture alive under occupation.
“We are spreading Ukrainian poems and the works of Ukrainian authors, and (celebrating) Ukrainian holidays, the traditional ones, just to remind to everybody that this is not Russia, and never was, and never will be,” she said.
She described living in the city like “getting into a time machine and going back to the USSR.”
“There’s propaganda and Soviet-style monuments, and Soviet holidays, and we are always waiting in lines, like in Soviet times, to get help, or to go to the doctor, or to get some documents, you have to wait in these long lines and there are no normal shops and no brands… just stuff you can get in the street markets and some strange Chinese products.”
Russian authorities have been meticulously erasing Ukrainian national identity, religion and language in occupied Ukraine. They have staged sham referenda on joining Russia and have been forcing the local population to become Russian citizens.
Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new decree ordering Ukrainian citizens living in these areas to “regulate their legal status” by adopting Russian citizenship. According to the decree, those who don’t do so by September will become foreigners and will only be allowed to stay for limited time.
But Moscow has already effectively coerced many Ukrainian people into accepting Russian passports because life is nearly impossible and very dangerous without them.
Those who don’t have Russian documents face the daily threat of arrest and deportation to Russia, have no right to work, no access to even the most basic health services or pensions and are barred from owning property.
“You can’t even call an ambulance without (a Russian passport). If you don’t have a Russian passport, the ambulance will not come,” the resistance woman said.
Human rights watchdogs have repeatedly said that Moscow is breaking international law by forcing the Ukrainian population to adopt Russian passports.
“And then the big problem for men, the men who (were forced to get) Russian passports, they are now trying to mobilize them into the Russian Army. They want to force them to fight against their own people,” the woman added.
The risk of trying to leave
Millions of Ukrainians are refusing to leave their homes in occupied territories – most because they still believe that Kyiv, with the help of its Western allies, will eventually liberate all its land.
There are also some who sympathize with Russia and are happy with the new regime – although both the Zla Mavka woman and Stepan said they believe this is only a small minority.
“These are often people who did not have a very good life before. For example, they didn’t have education and didn’t have a good job, but now, if they cry out loud ‘I love Russia,’ they will get a job in the government, they will get help and money from Russia,” the Zla Mavka member said.
SOS Donbas, a Ukrainian helpline for people living in occupied territories and combat zones, received more than 57,500 calls last year. Violeta Artemchuk, the director of the organization, said most people are asking for advice on how to leave safely, how to access help and what the implications are of staying and being forced to take a Russian passport.
The Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly told people in occupied areas to do whatever they need to stay safe.
“If you need to get some documents, get them. This does not change your status,” Heorhii Tykhyi, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said after the decree requiring Ukrainians in occupied territories to become Russian citizens was announced.
Tykhyi said that “the best solution, if possible, is to leave for the controlled territory of Ukraine.”
But for many, leaving is impossible because it’s too dangerous, too expensive and too treacherous.
“Theoretically, it’s possible to leave, but you have to go through filtration,” the Zla Mavka woman said, referring to a security screening process conducted by Russian forces on all exits from the occupied areas.
“They’re checking everything there, so… let’s say there is a woman whose husband was a soldier in 2014, and if they find out, she will have a huge problem, so for her, it is safer not to try. But this could be anything, like a comment on social media, something on your phone, they can just arrest you and deport you to Russia,” she said.
Thousands of Ukrainian citizens have been illegally detained and sent to Russia, and CNN has documented cases of people who were picked up at Russian filtration points and subsequently sent to facilities thousands of miles away from Ukraine.
It is impossible to cross directly from occupied Ukraine into government-controlled areas, which means that anyone wishing to flee must travel through Russia, get out of Russia and then travel through Europe back to Ukraine.
“It’s not easy to leave everything and become a refugee. You can’t sell your apartment, you cannot cross the border with a large amount of money, you can’t take much… so it is possible, but not for everyone,” the woman said.
So, for now, she and millions of others are staying and watching the news coming from the White House and elsewhere in horror.
“People are very nervous and they’re very afraid to hear about a negotiation, and how our cities will become Russia, this is the biggest fear. But I can tell you that even if this happens, resistance won’t stop.”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/europe/ukraine-us-ambassador-resignation-intl-latam/index.html,"Pressures from Kyiv and Washington led to US ambassador’s resignation, sources say",2025-04-12 18:43:33,"When US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink resigned her post two days ago, she was both under pressure from President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office in Kyiv, and feeling the strain of working for her ultimate boss in Washington, President Donald Trump, according to people who knew her.
At the same time, she was almost three years into a posting in a war zone away from her family – a situation that had also taken an inevitable toll, people said. An “extraordinary performance,” said a State Department spokesperson, paying tribute.
Her sudden departure marks the latest upheaval in Washington’s relations with Kyiv since the Trump administration took office and began a dramatic re-orientation of US policy away from Ukraine and toward Russia.
A former Ukrainian official with a positive view of Brink told CNN the ambassador felt she could no longer do what was right under the new administration.
“She was a very systematic supporter of Ukraine during her three years (in Kyiv). She did everything her position allowed her to do in order for Ukraine to succeed. Her principles would not allow her to do the opposite,” the former official said.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said he had communicated with the ambassador following her decision to leave and stressed it was not an emotional decision she had taken, but one that was carefully considered.
“She took a very rational decision about what she can do right now, in a new environment, under new circumstances,” the official said.
Brink began her stint in May 2022, just a few months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While Kyiv’s key interlocutors were inside the White House – National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in particular played a central role during the Biden era – Brink maintained a high visibility in country and on social media, promoting the Biden administration’s policy of military and humanitarian aid transfers.
Western ambassadors who worked alongside her in Ukraine spoke of her work ethic and professionalism.
“Tough as nails, almost a machine sometimes, but with a kind of authentic engagement and real kind of fire,” one told CNN approvingly.
That toughness was tested throughout her posting, people who know her told CNN, but was challenged to breaking point by Trump’s return to power.
The new administration has opened multiple channels to Moscow, following three years of diplomatic isolation. It has switched from supporting Ukraine’s “irreversible path” to NATO membership to all but ruling it out completely. And at one point last month, the US even paused all military aid and intelligence-sharing to force Kyiv to commit to talks to end the war.
The difficulties in dealing with such a pronounced shift in US policy came to a head for Brink in two of her social media posts.
The first was a retweet of a posting by Secretary of State Marco Rubio just hours after Zelensky was publicly assailed by Trump and his deputy JD Vance at a meeting in the White House at the end of February.
“Thank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no president has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America first. America is with you!” read Rubio’s tweet, which Brink separately sent out translated into Ukrainian.
Seventeen hundred people piled into the comments expressing astonishment that someone who had previously been so vocal in support of Ukraine was now apparently cheering the humiliation of its leader.
“Resign and maintain your dignity,” was one of the more polite responses. Many showed considerably less restraint.
The second was a tweet sent just a week ago, following a Russian attack on the southern city of Kryvyi Rih which resulted in the heaviest loss of civilian life in a single strike this year.
“Horrified that tonight a ballistic missile struck near a playground and restaurant in Kryvyi Rih. More than 50 people injured and 16 killed, including six children. This is why the war must end,” she wrote.
Zelensky himself issued a withering response in his nightly address, drawing attention to her failure to name check Russia.
“Such a strong country, such a strong people – and such a weak reaction. They are even afraid to say the word ‘Russian’ when talking about the missile that killed children,” he said.
Brink did mention Russia in subsequent references to the attack, and the former Ukrainian official expresses sympathy over the predicament she found herself in.
“She was part of her system; she had to do it,” he told CNN.
Confirming Brink’s departure to reporters on Thursday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce ducked a suggestion the ambassador had been expressly instructed to reduce public references to Russia, saying she was “not aware of anything like that,” adding that she “wouldn’t speak to anything regarding … a diplomat and the internal dynamics that might occur.”
CNN has been unable to contact Brink for comment.
It was not just relations with her own government that deteriorated as the Trump team took over at the White House, people who know her say. Relations with Zelensky’s office had also long since become difficult.
The Ukrainian president’s office had grown ever more frustrated by what it saw as the Biden administration’s excessive caution over transfer of weapons such as longer-range tactical missiles known as ATACMs, or F-16 fighter jets, and as the ranking US official in Ukraine, she often bore the brunt, people who knew her said. Her relationship with Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, was particularly strained.
In addition, she advocated hard for the introduction of anti-corruption measures and reforms aimed at increasing transparency. Back home, these were seen as crucial in winning round skeptics in Congress reluctant to approve Ukraine spending bills for fear the money would be syphoned off. In Kyiv, says Andy Hunder of the American Chamber of Commerce, it made her unpopular.
“She’s been very good for the business community in Ukraine … with a focus on the shadow economy … but (too often) there wasn’t the political will to do anything about it,” Hunder says.
A former ambassador from Europe who was in Kyiv at the same time as Brink is more blunt.
“She never sugar-coated things … she was always very clear with them as to the kind of standards against which they would be met in Washington … and I think that kind of pissed them off.”
Hunder says he believes by the end Brink was simply exhausted from the political pressures from both governments she had to deal with.
The former Ukrainian official who spoke to CNN in support of Brink was clear her departure was bad news.
“We were lucky, we had a great supporter. Right now, we have uncertainty,” he said.",[],en

The US has for months been steadily pulling back from the group, which was founded by former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in 2022 after Russia’s invasion as a way for dozens of countries to streamline the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine to quell Russian military advances.
Whereas Austin or a senior Pentagon official always chaired the group’s monthly meetings, Hegseth has ceded that role to the UK in recent months—even as a senior US general told lawmakers on Thursday that “continuing to assist Ukraine on the battlefield daily” is “very important” when it comes to maintaining leverage over the Russians.
Hegseth attended a meeting of the UDCG in February at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where he told allies that the US would no longer be a guarantor of European security and that it was highly “unlikely” that Ukraine would ever join NATO—a comment that, at the time, marked a dramatic shift from the longtime US position that Ukraine would one day join the alliance.
Defense News was first to report Hegseth is likely to skip the meeting next week.
The Trump administration has turned on and off its military and intelligence support to Ukraine in recent months as a way to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. The US hasn’t imposed any penalties on Russia, even as Moscow has refused to agree to a White House proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and continues to place conditions on even a partial ceasefire in the Black Sea.
Russia also wasn’t on the list of countries the Trump administration announced it is imposing tariffs on this week.
Trump attacked Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly last weekend and threatened tariffs on countries which buy Russian oil, but days later temporarily suspended sanctions on a Russian financier and Putin ally in order to host him for meetings this week in Washington, DC—the first time a Russian official has traveled to DC for such talks since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
As the Russian negotiator, Kirill Dimitriev, was in DC for meetings on Thursday, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the head of US European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe was testifying to Congress that Russia poses a “chronic” and “growing” threat to the US and the west saying Russia is “actively waging a campaign of destabilization across Europe and beyond.”
“Russia’s war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year, has revealed Russia to be a chronic threat, and we see in the future it will be a growing threat, one that is willing to use military force to achieve its geopolitical goals,” Cavoli told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.
“Further exacerbating this threat from Russia are the deepening partnerships among our adversaries — Iran, the Communist Chinese Party, the DPRK, and Russia itself. And these are increasingly posing a global risk,” he said.
Dimitriev and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff met on Wednesday, sources told CNN.
US and western intelligence officials do not believe that Russia is interested in negotiating a ceasefire deal with Ukraine in good faith, CNN has reported. Moscow still believes it can sustain its war effort and outlast Ukraine on the battlefield.
A senior NATO official reiterated that on Thursday, saying that “Russia still believes that time mostly is on its side.”
“We have had questions for a long time about whether Putin intends to negotiate in good faith,” the official said. Russia is “willing to continue those talks [about mending ties with the US] at the same time that it is delaying and stalling and saying that they can’t accept the US proposals right now, on the actual ceasefire. I think all of that supports the idea that Russia’s goals haven’t changed at all—that right now, what it is trying to do is probably stall for time, make less concessions on the war, and try to instead make progress on sanctions, on Russia’s place in the international community.”","['Natasha Bertrand', 'Alex Marquardt', 'Haley Britzky', 'Jennifer Hansler']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/europe/putin-russia-spring-conscription-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Putin calls up 160,000 men to Russian army in latest conscription drive, at crucial moment in Ukraine war",2025-04-02 12:33:43,"One of the largest rounds of conscription to Russia’s military for several years is underway, as President Vladimir Putin pushes ahead with an expansion of the country’s military at a crucial moment in the war in Ukraine.
Putin signed a decree authorizing the latest phase of the country’s twice-yearly conscription effort, with the new window beginning Tuesday and running until July 15.
It will see 160,000 men between 18 and 30 join Russia’s armed forces – an increase of 10,000 on last year’s spring drive, and a rise of more than 15,000 compared to three years ago, according to Russian state media outlet TASS.
The conscription push is not new, and TASS reported that the rise is caused by Putin’s efforts to increase the size of Russia’s military as a whole; the country had 1 million military personnel three years ago, but now has around 1.5 million.
But the new push also comes at a vital crossroads in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Moscow has been relying on assistance from North Korean soldiers to push back Kyiv’s advances in the Kursk region of Russia, and has been steadily advancing on the ground in eastern Ukraine, while the US attempts to broker talks that would end the conflict.
Russian law prohibits sending conscripts drafted for mandatory service to active combat zones without proper training. While the official stance is that conscripts are not sent to Ukraine, reports have surfaced of conscripts being pressured or misled into signing contracts that result in their deployment to the front lines in Ukraine. Others found themselves under attack when Kyiv launched its surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August 2024.
Russian troops have continued sustained attacks in the Pokrovsk area of Donetsk in recent weeks, and have launched aerial assaults against Ukrainian cities, even while discussions with the US continue.
Senior Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev is meanwhile expected to visit Washington this week to meet with top Trump official Steve Witkoff for talks on strengthening relations between the two countries as they seek to end the war in Ukraine, according to a US official and two sources familiar with the plans.
His visit will mark the first time a senior Russian official has visited Washington, DC, for talks since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and marks a further step in the marked warming in relations between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to office in January.
Trump acknowledged in an interview with Newsmax last week that Russia may be “dragging their feet.”
Putin not only rejected Trump’s recent call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine but also added conditions – including the lifting of US sanctions – for a ceasefire on fighting in the Black Sea after last week’s latest negotiations wrapped up and the moratorium had been announced by the White House.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/europe/ukraine-minerals-deal-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html,Ukraine: Trump accuses Zelensky of ‘trying to back out’ of proposed minerals deal,2025-03-30 00:00:00,"US President Donald Trump accused the Ukrainian president of “trying to back out” of the minerals deal expected to be agreed between the two countries as early as this week, adding that Volodymyr Zelensky would face “big problems” if he didn’t sign an agreement. But Ukraine has highlighted that the conditions of the deal changed significantly in recent days.
“I see he’s trying to back out of the rare earth deal. And if he does that, he’s got some problems. Big, big problems,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force Once on Sunday. “We made a deal on rare earth and now he’s saying, ‘well, you know, I want to renegotiate the deal.’”
“He wants to be a member of NATO. Well, he was never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that. So if he’s looking to renegotiate the deal, he’s got big problems,” Trump said.
However, Zelensky told reporters Tuesday evening in Kyiv that “NATO membership is not a part of this deal and never was,” adding that Ukraine is “ready for an unconditional ceasefire.”
Zelensky also said last week that the conditions of the deal being negotiated are “constantly changing,” but overall, Ukraine feels positively toward a future agreement.
Ukraine received a new draft of the text on Friday, according to its foreign ministry. The new proposal, seen by CNN, was put forward by the US Treasury Department and goes well beyond the initial draft, particularly on future US rights and reimbursement for past assistance.
On Tuesday, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said they had held one round of consultations on the new version, and both sides were working “to reach a mutually acceptable text for signing.”
The Ukrainian president said last Thursday that the two countries had already agreed to a “framework agreement” and then a full agreement would be hashed out later, involving more research and ratification in the Ukrainian parliament. But then the US-side changed its position to put forward “a full agreement right away,” Zelensky said.
“So it’s too early to talk about the agreement, which has been changed several times. But I would not want the US to have a feeling that Ukraine is against it in general,” Zelensky said. “We have consistently shown our positive signals. We are for cooperation with the United States.”
An initial minerals deal went unsigned following Trump’s contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelensky in February.
But it has been revived in the form of the new proposal that would give the US more access to Kyiv’s rare earth minerals, according to two people familiar with the discussions and a copy of the draft proposal obtained by CNN on Thursday.
It does not, however, include language regarding one of Ukraine’s priorities — concrete security guarantees in the country’s ongoing war with Russia.
The deal would apply to all mineral resources, oil and gas across all of Ukraine, the sources said.
A key part of the proposal requires Ukrainian enterprises to contribute to a joint US-Ukraine investment fund that would be overseen by a five-person board consisting of three members from Washington and two from Kyiv – prompting concerns that Ukraine would be ceding sweeping control of key assets to the United States.
The draft obtained by CNN states that previous US assistance to Ukraine would be “deemed as contributions” to the partnership fund – something Kyiv has said it would not agree to, given that likely means Ukraine would not benefit from any revenues until the US has recouped all its assistance money.
The proposed agreement would give the US the “right of first offer” for all future natural resources projects and infrastructure investment projects. It also includes a clause stating Ukraine must make an effort to prevent critical minerals sales to any purchasers located in a country that the US International Development Finance Corporation “identifies as a strategic competitor of the United States.”
The Trump administration has argued that the potential minerals deal would serve as a leading reason for the US to remain invested in Ukraine as Washington pursues an end to the war.
Trump has also referred to a rare earth minerals agreement as a way for the US to be compensated for the aid and military assistance sent to Ukraine.
“The mineral deal offers Ukraine the opportunity to form an enduring economic relationship with the United States that is the basis for long term security and peace. It will strengthen our two nations’ relationship and benefit both parties,” National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt told CNN. “The deal will help make Ukraine prosperous and reflects America’s past and current commitment to Ukraine.”
Meanwhile, Washington and Moscow have also started talks related to cooperation on rare earth metals and other projects in Russia.
The Kremlin said Monday that no documents have been signed yet, but there is interest in cooperation.
It comes as Trump continues to push for an end to the war, expressing open frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the weekend.
“I was very angry – pissed off – when Putin started getting into Zelensky’s credibility, because that’s not going in the right location, you understand?” Trump told NBC News in an interview, referring to the Russian leader’s comments suggesting Ukraine be put under a “temporary administration” while the two nations work toward a ceasefire deal.
Trump continued, “But new leadership means you’re not gonna have a deal for a long time, right? … But I was pissed off about it. But if a deal isn’t made, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, I’m going to put secondary sanctions on Russia.”
“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, which it might not be, but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said.
Asked on Sunday aboard Air Force One if there is a deadline for Putin to agree to a deal, Trump said: “It’s a psychological deadline. If I think they’re tapping us along, I will not be happy about it.”
Meanwhile, Finland’s president, who made a surprise visit to Florida over the weekend to meet Trump and play a round of golf, said he told his US counterpart a deadline should be set.
After the two leaders’ meeting in Florida, Finnish President Alexander Stubb told reporters that Trump’s patience with Russia was running out.
“April 20 would be a good time for a full ceasefire without any conditions… Because a deadline is needed, because it is Easter and because President Donald Trump will have been in office for three months,” Stubb said Sunday regarding his suggestion for a deadline.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/europe/timeline-trumps-pledge-to-end-ukraine-war/index.html,Ukraine war: Timeline of how Trump’s pledge to end the war in hit reality,2025-03-26 13:40:50,"Over the past two months, the United States has been talking with both Ukraine and Russia – separately – to try to fulfil one of President Donald Trump’s main campaign promises: ending the war in Ukraine. Trump repeatedly touted that he would end the war within 24 hours of taking office if elected president, but there is no sign yet of a real breakthrough.
Trump has walked back from his pledge – first extending the self-imposed deadline to six months, then saying he was being “a little bit sarcastic” about the 24-hour timeframe.
More recently the president said in an interview with Newsmax that Moscow could be “dragging their feet” on a ceasefire deal.
Trump has made it clear that Ukraine will have to acquiesce to his hardline approach if it wants to continue to receive military support from the country.
And while Russia has said it agrees in principle to the US ceasefire proposals, it has consistently come up with “buts” and “only ifs” that undermine any deals.
Here’s how the ceasefire negotiations have played out so far:
January 20: Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States. On the campaign trail, Trump had promised to end the war in Ukraine in a day.
February 12: Trump announces he has called Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a possible ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia. It’s the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office in January.
The call marks a U-turn on years of US foreign policy and takes European allies by surprise. Moscow illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 – and launched a full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.
Later the same day, Trump calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to inform him about his conversation with Putin and his plans to end the war in Ukraine.
February 15: The White House says top officials will travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian officials to begin talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.
February 17: Kyiv and its European allies express disappointment over their exclusion from the talks, stressing that no deal can be done without Ukraine at the table. An emergency summit is held in Paris with European and NATO leaders.
February 18: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Riyadh. National security adviser Mike Waltz and Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff also attend the first round of the talks, with sovereign wealth fund chief Kirill Dmitriev attending with Russian officials.
Speaking after the talks, Rubio says concessions will have to be made by “all sides” to end the war. Meanwhile, Trump criticizes Zelensky, who says he won’t accept a deal made in Ukraine’s absence.
February 28: Zelensky travels to the US, where he was expected to sign a minerals deal with the country. However, the meeting descends into a chaotic argument between Zelensky and Trump after Vice President JD Vance attacks Zelensky and suggests Ukraine should use diplomacy to end the war, accusing him of not wanting peace.
Vance’s suggestion surprises Zelensky and an unusually public argument erupts between the three leaders.
The meeting ends with Zelensky being asked to leave early, with no sign of a deal.
March 1: The meeting-gone-wrong rattles European leaders, who convene an emergency summit in London to discuss what to do to keep Ukraine armed in its fight against Russia.
March 2: Zelensky receives a warm welcome in the UK, where he is greeted by King Charles III.
March 3: Trump says he will be withholding shipments of military aid to Ukraine. The pause applies to all aid not yet inside Ukraine, officials say. Within Europe and Ukraine, officials scramble to assess the impact of the pause and make a plan to keep Ukraine armed.
March 4: Zelensky issues a public statement, saying the Oval Office meeting did not go to plan and reiterating that Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals deal. He stops short of apologizing.
March 5: The US announces it will stop sharing crucial intelligence with the country. Later that day, Ukrainian and US officials say they have agreed to meet “in the near future.”
March 11: Ukraine agrees in principle to a US ceasefire proposal following talks between the two countries in Saudi Arabia, and the US agrees to reinstate military and intelligence sharing.
March 13: Witkoff travels to Moscow to brief Kremlin officials on the US-proposed plan. Putin says he agrees in principle but then presents a list of demands that make the plan impossible to carry out. Those demands include a suggestion that Ukraine halts mobilization and any training of its troops, and that other nations stop supplying weapons to Kyiv during the ceasefire.
March 18: Trump speaks to Putin on the phone but fails to convince him to sign on to the ceasefire agreement. The White House says that Russia has agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy and infrastructure targets in Ukraine. But Russia instead said it had agreed to refrain from attacks on “energy infrastructure.”
March 19: Trump and Zelensky speak on the phone. Trump says the call was “very good,” and lasted roughly one hour, with much of the conversation focusing on his conversation with Putin on the previous day.
March 21: The southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa is struck by a large-scale Russian drone attack.
March 23: US and Ukrainian officials meet in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine’s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov describes the talks as “productive and focused.”
March 24: US officials meet with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia.
March 25: Russian and US officials meet in the same hotel in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.
By the afternoon, the White House says Ukraine and Russia have agreed to “ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”
Zelensky tells a news conference that Kyiv has agreed to stop using military force in the Black Sea but, shortly after, the Kremlin says it will only agree provided financial sanctions are lifted on key Russian institutions – thereby making the deal void.
Following that call, Trump tells right-wing cable channel Newsmax he believes Russia wants to end its war with Ukraine, but that Moscow could be delaying a deal.
“I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they’re dragging their feet. I’ve done it over the years,” the president says.
By afternoon, Trump tells reporters that his administration is looking at Russia’s conditions. “We’re thinking about all of them right now,” he says from the White House.
March 26: Ahead of a meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” in Paris, Zelensky says he hopes America will secure the Black Sea agreement without conceding to Russia’s demands.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tells CNN that Moscow doesn’t believe Zelensky has fully grasped the changed nature of US-Russia relations.
March 27: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yılmaz join France’s President Emmanuel Macron and Zelensky for what will be the third meeting of the “coalition of the willing” in Paris. The alliance says it’s not the time to lift sanctions on Russia.
Zelensky later says the conditions of the minerals deal being negotiated between Ukraine and the US are “constantly changing,” but that overall Ukraine feels positively toward a future agreement.
March 28: Four civilians are killed in a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, authorities say. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of striking energy infrastructure, a week after both countries agreed temporarily to halt attacks on such targets. Zelensky also rules out direct peace talks with Putin, saying he would rather negotiate with Russian businessmen or the opposition.
March 30: Trump says he’s “pissed off” with Putin, telling NBC News he could impose additional tariffs on Russian oil if Putin doesn’t cooperate in ongoing negotiations to end his war in Ukraine.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/europe/europe-defense-wake-up-ukraine-russia-trump-intl/index.html,‘PATHETIC’ Europe may finally be waking up from its military slumber,2025-03-30 04:00:35,"It was a televised ambush that many in Europe hope will stop a war.
Donald Trump’s dressing-down of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House was a lightning strike to the transatlantic alliance, dispelling lingering illusions in Europe about whether their American cousin will stand with them to counter Russian aggression.
Reeling, perhaps even fearful, Europe may have finally come to its senses over its self-defense needs in the era of Trump.
“It is as if Roosevelt welcomed Churchill (to the White House) and started bullying him,” European lawmaker Raphaël Glucksmann told CNN.
In a month when US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called Europe “PATHETIC” for “free-loading” on defense in a group chat with administration officials (which inadvertently included a journalist for The Atlantic), the continent has been shattering decades-old taboos on defense. Policies are on the table that would have been unthinkable just weeks ago.
The biggest change came in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy. After the federal election, chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz won a vote in parliament to scrap Germany’s constitutional “debt brake” – a mechanism to limit government borrowing.
In principle, the law change allows for unlimited spending on defense and security. Experts expect the move to unlock as much as €600 billion ($652 billion) in Germany over the next decade.
“This is a game-changer in Europe, because Germany was the laggard – especially among the big countries – when it comes to defense,” Piotr Buras, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, an international think tank, told CNN.
In getting over its phobia of debt, Buras said that Germany has finally acted as though Europe really had passed a “Zeitenwende” – or “turning point” – as described by outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz in February 2022, just three days after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Although the invasion jolted Germany, “only the Trump shock made them take this really fundamental decision of suspending the debt brake,” said Buras.
“This is the real, proper Zeitenwende.”
Taboos crumbling
In neighboring France, President Emmanuel Macron – who has long called for European “strategic autonomy” from the US – has said he is considering extending the protection of its nuclear arsenal to its allies, already ostensibly sheltered by American bombs.
Macron’s comments earlier this month came after Merz advocated for talks with France and the United Kingdom – Europe’s two nuclear powers – over extending their nuclear protection. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk welcomed the idea, and even called for Poland to consider getting nuclear weapons itself.
Meanwhile, Poland and Baltic states Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – all neighbors to Russia – have pulled out of the 1997 Ottawa treaty on landmines, long considered a key milestone in the end to mass warfare. Lithuania has already announced the purchase of 85,000 landmines; Poland is eyeing producing 1 million domestically.
Lithuania also withdrew from the international treaty against cluster munitions this month, becoming the first signatory ever to do so.
Military conscription has also made a comeback on the continent. Denmark made women eligible for obligatory conscription from 2026 and lowered health requirements for some roles, as part of a bolstering of the country’s armed forces. Poland has also announced plans for every adult male to undergo military training.
Even famously neutral countries are reconsidering their positions. Amid discussions about how to keep the peace in Ukraine in the event of a settlement, the government in Ireland – a military minnow focused on peacekeeping operations – put forward legislation to allow troops to be deployed without UN approval, skirting a possible Russian (or American) veto.
It’s long been the uncomfortable – and often unspoken – truth in Europe that its protection from invasion was ultimately dependent on the American cavalry riding over the horizon. That support no longer looks so sure.
The pivot goes beyond who will do the fighting to who will provide the arms. Some have begun to question future purchases of the astronomically expensive US-made F-35 jets that several European air forces had planned to acquire.
Portuguese Defense Minister Nuno Melo said his country was re-evaluating the expected purchases of the jets in preference for European alternatives over concerns of the US-controlled supply of spare parts.
It’s the first time such concerns were aired publicly at such a high level, especially in favor of jets that, on paper, don’t offer the same capabilities.
European unity?
But, although Europe seems to have gotten the message, talk of a unified approach is premature.
When European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled a plan to spend billions more on defense, called “ReArm Europe,” Spain and Italy balked. The plan has since been renamed “Readiness 2030.”
Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has also ruled out sending Italian troops as part of a European contingent to keep the peace in Ukraine if a negotiated settlement – another key issue on which the continent is split.
The rebranding indicates a dividing line in Europe: The further away from Russia a country is, the less likely it is to put guns before butter.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said this month that “our threat is not Russia bringing its troops across the Pyrenees.” He called on Brussels “to take into account that the challenges we face in the southern neighborhood are a bit different to the ones that the eastern flank faces.”
Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s former foreign minister, told CNN he was “upset” by the Spanish statements, and that a recent trip to Kyiv – where air raid sirens blast most nights – made it all too easy to imagine similar scenes occurring in Vilnius in the future.
“The further west you go, the more difficult it is to imagine that sort of thing. All the problems, all the decisions, they’re relative,” Landsbergis said.
Although this geographical split could deepen divisions, Buras, of the ECFR, said total European unity would always be “an illusion.”
“What really matters is what the key countries do,” he said, pointing to Germany, France, the UK and Poland. “I want to be cautiously optimistic, but I think we are on the right track now.”
Asked whether March would be remembered as the month Europe woke up, Buras said: “Yes, we have woken up – but now we need to get dressed.”","['Christian Edwards', 'Joseph Ataman']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/29/europe/ukraine-russia-war-belgorod-intl/index.html,Ukraine launches attacks in Russia’s Belgorod region as it faces setbacks on home soil,2025-03-29 00:00:00,"Ukrainian forces have responded to Russian efforts to expel them from one part of Russian territory by launching a large number of attacks on another border area, using drones, artillery and troops.
More than 20 villages in Russia’s Belgorod region – which are located in a 150-kilometer (90-mile) stretch of land along the Ukrainian border – have come under attack, according to the region’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. The Ukrainian military has not officially acknowledged the operation.
The assault by Ukrainian forces appears to be in response to their recent losses in the Russian region of Kursk, adjacent to Belgorod, where they seized more than 1,000 square kilometers last August. In recent weeks a fresh Russian offensive backed by North Korean troops has pushed them back to the border.
Both Russia and Ukraine are looking for gains across the 1,000-kilometer frontline as the weather improves – and as the Trump administration presses for a ceasefire.
Citing overnight aerial attacks in Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih and “other cities and communities,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday demanded an urgent “strong response” from the US in his nightly address.
“We expect a response – a serious one. We are working toward a response,” he said, describing 172 drone strikes on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure on Friday night. “A strong response is urgently needed – above all from the US, from Europe, from everyone in the world who has placed their bets on diplomacy. Russia must be forced into peace – only pressure will work,” he said.
Ukraine’s General Staff said soldiers being treated at a military hospital were injured in an attack by Russian drones in the northeastern city of Kharkiv in the late hours of Saturday. Two people were killed and twenty-five others were injured elsewhere in the city.
It is unclear whether the Ukrainian attacks in Belgorod are intended to take and hold Russian soil, or whether the move is an effort to relieve pressure on Ukrainian troops still in the Kursk area and in the adjoining Ukrainian region of Sumy by forcing a redeployment of Russian forces.
Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Thursday that Russian units were trying to make incursions into Sumy. And on Saturday, the Russian defense ministry claimed its troops had taken a small settlement inside the region.
So far, the Ukrainian incursion into Belgorod seems much less ambitious than last year’s Kursk offensive. According to Russian officials, it began nearly two weeks ago with a number of cross-border attacks.
The extent of Ukraine’s success so far in Belgorod is unclear. Unofficial Russian sources speak of a Ukrainian presence several kilometers inside Russia. One Russian military blogger said Saturday that the Ukrainians had managed to gain a foothold in the village of Popovka inside Belgorod and that “heavy fighting continues” there.
Earlier this week, Russian television reporter Anna Prokofieva was killed in the same area.
Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces appear very much on the backfoot. In the east of Ukraine, Russian troops continue sustained attacks in the Pokrovsk area of Donetsk – at the highest intensity yet this year, according to the unofficial Ukrainian blog Deep State. But Deep State said the Ukrainians had reduced the rate of their territorial losses since January.
Further south in Zaporizhzhia, the situation for the Ukrainians is deteriorating, according to the spokesman for the military there, Vladyslav Voloshyn. He said Friday that the number of Russian assaults, using small infantry groups, had “increased significantly.”
Geolocated video shows that the Russians have advanced into the town of Shcherbaky. The town was claimed by the Russian defense ministry Saturday. One Russian blog spoke of heavy fighting in the area.
A Ukrainian military commentator acknowledged gains by Russian troops in the area, adjacent to an important highway, though he noted the troops’ heavy losses.
Kostiantyn Mashovets, another Ukrainian military analyst, estimates that the Russians have accumulated as many as 70,000 troops along the Zaporizhzhia front, plus hundreds of tanks and artillery guns.
The Kremlin holds some three-quarters of Zaporizhzhia and has illegally declared its complete annexation.
Little progress toward a ceasefire
Negotiations on limited ceasefires, mediated with some fanfare by the United States, are making little progress. The Kremlin added several conditions for a ceasefire in the Black Sea that are unacceptable to both Ukraine and its European allies.
Moscow and Kyiv accuse each other of targeting energy facilities, despite an agreement earlier this month that they would cease. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that “Russia reserves the right not to comply with the moratorium on attacking the energy sector, which Kyiv constantly violates.”
One of the Russian negotiators said Friday that he did not expect an overall ceasefire agreement until at least the end of this year. Grigory Karasin said talks in Riyadh “did not lead to anything radical” and “it would be naive to expect breakthrough.” Progress, he said, might be expected at best at the end of the year.
Zelensky has claimed that Russia plans a multi-pronged offensive in the coming weeks to lock in territorial gains ahead of any further ceasefire negotiations.
“They’re dragging out the talks and trying to get the US stuck in endless, pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelensky said Thursday on a visit to Paris. “Putin wants to negotiate over territory from a stronger position.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/politics/mcconnell-trump-russia-ukraine/index.html,McConnell warns of ‘embarrassing naivete’ in Trump admin’s dealings with Putin while sharply criticizing Ukraine policy,2025-03-28 16:28:52,"Former Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell sharply criticized the Trump administration’s Ukraine policy and pivot toward isolationism Thursday night, accusing President Donald Trump’s advisers of showing “their embarrassing naivete” in dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
McConnell, a staunch supporter of Ukraine who delivered remarks while being awarded the US-Ukraine Foundation’s highest honor, warned that “some of the president’s advisers” are urging Trump to pull back from supporting the war-torn nation, and argued that such a move would be a sign of “weakness.”
“This war is a reminder that what happens in one region has implications in another. That weakness in the face of one adversary would invite aggression from another even closer to home. That our credibility was not divisible,” McConnell said. “Allies half a world away in Asia have told us the same – that Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression matters to those who live in China’s shadow.”
“America can’t afford to ignore these lessons. But that’s exactly what some of the president’s advisers are urging him to do.”
The pointed remarks from McConnell come as Trump has spoken with Putin twice since taking office – breaking a sustained period of silence between the White House and the Kremlin – and follow the president’s fiery Oval Office meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky late last month.
McConnell’s desire for an active US role in deterring aggression from Russia in Ukraine has put him at odds with a growing share of the Republican electorate, which has embraced Trump’s more isolationist view. And while the Kentucky Republican has largely voted with Trump during his tenure, he recently put himself at odds with nearly all Senate Republicans when he cast a trio of votes against Trump’s Cabinet nominees – including for the critical defense secretary and director of national intelligence roles.
In turn, McConnell, the longest-serving leader in Senate history when he stepped down from the role in November, has drawn Trump’s ire.
McConnell on Thursday noted that the US’ allies and adversaries are watching closely as the administration praises Putin.
“When the president’s envoys trumpet the magnanimity of a thuggish autocrat, they do so under the watchful eyes of his friends in Beijing, Tehran, and Pyongyang. When his representatives in negotiations masquerade as neutral arbiters, or legitimize sham elections, or treat aggressor and victim as morally equivalent, they do so in full view of longtime partners across the globe – some who know the taste of aggression, and some who have good reason to fear its imminent arrival,” McConnell said.
“When American officials court the favor of an adversary at the expense of allies. When they mock our friends to impress an enemy. They reveal their embarrassing naivete.”
The former GOP leader pointed to former President Ronald Reagan’s military buildup and the end of the Cold War, and specifically what he said is “the most popular phrase in Washington today: peace through strength.”
“But too many of those who use it – particularly among the president’s advisers – don’t seem ready to summon the resources and national will it requires,” he argued.
McConnell ended with a stark warning: “To cut off Ukraine is to stab ourselves in the back. So is the denigration of allies who have fought and died alongside us.”","['Morgan Rimmer', 'Manu Raju']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/europe/analysis-ukraine-european-reassurance-force-risk-intl-cmd/index.html,European bid for Ukraine ‘reassurance’ force is fraught with risk,2025-03-27 00:00:00,"Even before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s car crash meeting at the White House last month, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer had talked confidently of putting British boots on the ground in Ukraine - widely understood to mean land forces - in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.
After the Washington mauling, Starmer – along with French President Emmanuel Macron and other European leaders - quickly doubled down on their pledges of support for Ukraine’s leader.
“This is not a moment for more talk,” Starmer said following a major gathering of heads of state and government leaders in London the next day. “It is time to act.”
Now, though, four weeks on and after two further major meetings of European leaders, the overwhelming sense is that of a process inexorably slowing down. We should probably not be surprised.
The preferred terminology now is of a “reassurance force” for Ukraine – talk of European “peacekeepers” is no longer in the lexicon. Such a force would not act on the front line, Macron told reporters after Thursday’s meeting in Paris, and it would not act on behalf of Ukrainian forces.
Recent reports have suggested that London, in particular, might be going cool on the idea of putting troops on the ground in Ukraine, but Macron insisted nothing has so far been ruled out.
“We are looking into the air, at sea, and on the ground as well. Nothing is excluded,” he said, adding, “that (reassurance) force will be deployed in Ukraine.”
Further details will come in due course, but French and British military chiefs now have the task of working with their Ukrainian counterparts to establish the number of troops that would make up such a force and where they might be located, as well as their capabilities, he said.
In military parlance, it is time to get to work on the “operating concept” that would underpin any such force. What are the possible threats that it would likely face? What would be the rules of engagement?
These are not simple matters and will likely take weeks to nail down. Inevitably, answers to those questions need to assume limited, or non-existent, US participation, which will likely further slow down planning.
For Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former defense minister of Ukraine, ambitions need to be realistic.
He points to the obvious logistical challenges presented by his country’s massive 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line with Russia, and the low probability that Starmer and Macron would approve rules of engagement that could see European troops entering into direct combat with Russian soldiers. A forward deployment of British or French land forces would be an ineffective endeavor, he warns, but so too could a less far-reaching commitment.
“There have been so many discussions that Europe would step in and help with security arrangements, but if they end up sending 10,000 people to stay in Kyiv, unable to leave the city, that’s certainly not going to change anything in Russia’s calculations,” he told CNN.
In fact, with a negligible deterrence effect, such a move could actually make Europe emerge weaker. The temptation for Russia to humiliate London and Paris - by breaking any ceasefire with an attack carried out hundreds of miles away from British and French troops stuck in the capital - could prove hard to resist.
In a paper written for the London-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank, Zagorodnyuk, along with two colleagues, argues that a better option for Europe could be “airmen boots” on the ground – a commitment to police Ukraine’s skies from Russian strikes.
Such a protection would almost certainly mean British, French and other warplanes stationed in Ukraine, along with aircrews and accompanying logistical support. It might be that Europe only provided cover over western and central Ukraine, he says, but even that would at least allow Ukraine to devote all of its forces to defending the eastern part of the country.
Even a reassurance force that extended no further than putting air assets inside Ukraine would still be a major step for Europe. But the potential credibility risks, while still extant, would surely be lower than with any deployment of land forces.
At the same time, Europe needs to be extremely careful. Managing expectations in the run-up to any possible announcement is also key. The credibility of any eventual deployment will be judged to a considerable extent on how it measures up to what had been previously discussed in public.
If it appears to fall too short, it won’t just be Ukraine that feels short-changed. Putin and Trump will also have their suspicions confirmed that Europe is a dead duck.",['Andrew Carey'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/world/russia-sanctions-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html,European leaders say now not the time to lift sanctions on Russia in clear message to Trump,2025-03-27 14:23:01,"Ukraine’s European allies say now is not the time for lifting sanctions on Russia, in a clear message to the Trump administration as Moscow pushes Washington for concessions ahead of signing a US brokered deal on ending the fighting in the Black Sea.
The leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany all affirmed at a summit on Thursday that Europe will not lift sanctions on Russia – a strong and seemingly coordinated nod to the Trump administration, which has said it is still evaluating the Kremlin’s demands.
They spoke after a meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” in Paris which discussed how to bolster support for Kyiv and what role they might play if a peace deal is struck with Russia.
The Trump administration’s willingness to embrace Moscow as he seeks a quick end to the war against Ukraine, which has included vocal support for key Russian demands even before talks had even begun, has alarmed European allies.
While divisions remain among European leaders about how to respond, they spoke in unison on Russia’s demand to ease sanctions.
“(There is) complete clarity that now is not the time for lifting of sanctions,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.
“Quite the contrary – what we discussed is how we can increase sanctions to support the US initiative, to bring Russia to the table through further pressure from this group of countries,” the British Prime Minister said, still striking a conciliatory tone toward the United States.
Starmer said the meeting involved more than 30 countries, including Ukraine’s European allies and NATO officials. He described the meeting as “very constructive.”
Echoing Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said stopping sanctions would be a “serious mistake.”
“It makes no sense to end the sanctions until peace has actually been achieved, and unfortunately we are still a long way from that, as you can see.”
This week the US announced that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to end fighting in the Black Sea. But Moscow soon followed up the statement by saying it would only implement the deal once some of the sanctions imposed on Russian banks and exports over its invasion of Ukraine are lifted.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the United States is “going to evaluate” Russia’s conditions to agreeing to a Black Sea partial ceasefire.
When the US negotiators return from Saudi Arabia, Rubio said, they will be “sitting down, going through the proposals, getting their impressions of the conversations, so we can more fully understand what the Russian position is, or what their ask is in exchange.”
“There was absolute clarity that Russia is trying to delay, is playing games. And we have to be absolutely clear about that,” Starmer added.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also called for “more pressure” and “more packages of sanctions” on Russia.
“All 31 votes today supported that there will be no lifting of any sanctions against Russia until this war ends in a just peace,” Zelensky said in a press conference from Paris.
Zelensky also called for unity amid Russian President Vladimir Putin’s desire to “divide Europe and America.”
“We want America to be stronger. I agree with Emmanuel (Macron) that we all need it. It’s not even a matter of desire, but we need America to be stronger in relation to Russia,” the Ukrainian president said.
“Putin wants to negotiate over territory from a stronger position. He’s thinking only about war,” Zelensky said earlier in a social media post.
“They’re dragging-out the talks and trying to get the US stuck in endless, pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelensky added, highlighting that Ukrainian intelligence indicates Russian forces are getting ready for new offensives against the Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine.
‘Reassurance forces’
France also shed more light on a proposal to send forces drawn from European armies to Ukraine in the event that a ceasefire is reached.
France and the United Kingdom previously floated the idea of sending peacekeepers to Ukraine and said they would be willing to put boots on the ground. But their latest discussions have honed in on an alternate term: “reassurance forces.”
“These would be forces from a number of states … present in strategic locations pre-identified with the Ukrainians which would provide long-term support, reassurance for the armies and act as a deterrent to potential Russian aggression,” Macron said Thursday, adding that the forces would never serve as a “substitution for the Ukrainian army.”
Regarding support for the “reassurance forces,” Macron said: “It was not unanimous today, as we all know, and we don’t need unanimity.”
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said allies discussed the possibility of the United Nations playing a part in enforcing a ceasefire, but underlined that Italian forces would not participate in a possible military force deployed in Ukraine.
“During the meeting, the leaders also discussed the importance of effective implementation and monitoring of the ceasefire, on which a possible role for the United Nations is emerging, in line with the position of the Italian government,” Italy’s readout of the summit said.
Meloni, one of Trump’s closest allies in Europe, also expressed hopes that the United States would participate in the next meeting of the coalition.
The United States is not currently a member of the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ with Macron acknowledging that although he “hopes” the US would support a European deployment to Ukraine, Europe needs to “prepare for a situation where they (the US) will not commit” to Ukraine’s security.
Russia has repeatedly said it would consider any foreign military presence in Ukraine “unacceptable.”
The French president also announced plans for a French-British team to be sent to Ukraine to help Kyiv “prepare the format of tomorrow’s Ukrainian army.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/europe/north-korea-russia-ukraine-soldiers-intl-hnk/index.html,"North Korea has sent 3,000 more soldiers to bolster Russia’s war on Ukraine, South Korea says",2025-02-26 00:00:00,"North Korea appears to have sent at least 3,000 more soldiers to Russia early this year, South Korea’s military said Thursday, demonstrating Pyongyang’s continued support for Moscow’s war on Ukraine as world leaders push for an end to the three-year conflict.
The news comes as Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said a visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Russia is being prepared, according to state media TASS.
The reinforcements, sent in January and February, add to the roughly 11,000 troops North Korea has sent to Russia so far, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. About 4,000 of them have been killed or injured in combat, according to Seoul.
Pyongyang has also sent a “significant amount” of short-range ballistic missiles and about 220 pieces of 170-millimeter self-propelled howitzers and 240-millimeter multiple rocket launchers, South Korea said. It said the North’s contributions are “expected to increase according to the situation.”
While North Korea appears to be ramping up its support for Russia’s war, European leaders and allies are set to meet in Paris Thursday to discuss aid for Ukraine and long-term stability in the region, amid shaky efforts by the White House to broker a ceasefire.
Following talks in Saudi Arabia this week, the US said both Russia and Ukraine agreed to stop using force in the Black Sea and uphold a previously announced pause on attacks against energy infrastructure. But Russia introduced some far-reaching conditions for signing up to the partial truce, which falls far short of a 30-day full ceasefire initially proposed by the White House.
The Kremlin said it would only implement the agreements once sanctions on its banks and exports are lifted, showing the significant gulf in expectations between the negotiating parties.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, have been deepening security ties since they signed a landmark defense pact last year and pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
Putin’s top security adviser Sergei Shoigu met with Kim last week in Pyongyang, where he conveyed Putin’s “warmest wishes and greetings,” Russian state-run news agency TASS reported.
“He pays the utmost attention to the implementation of agreements reached with you,” Shoigu told Kim, according to TASS.
Deepening partnership
The United States has warned that Russia may be close to sharing advanced space and satellite technology with North Korea, on top of military equipment and training it is already providing, in exchange for North Korean support for the war in Ukraine.
North Korean troops had been deployed to the Russian region of Kursk to repel Ukraine’s incursion since at least November. But they withdrew from the front lines in January after reports of mass casualties, Ukrainian officials said.
South Korean lawmaker Yoo Yong-won, who visited Ukraine in late February, said about 400 North Korean soldiers in Russia had been killed and about 3,600 injured as of February 26.
CNN has previously reported on the brutal and near-suicidal tactics of North Korean soldiers, who in some cases have detonated grenades rather than be captured by Ukrainian forces, and have written pledges of allegiance to Kim on the battlefield.
Since the war began, North Korea has also sent thousands of shipping containers of munitions or munitions-related material to Russia, and Moscow’s forces have launched North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine, according to US officials.
North Korean medical facilities have also treated hundreds of Russian soldiers injured in Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Pyongyang said in an interview with state-run outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta in February.
Meanwhile, Russia supplies North Korea with coal, food and medicine, Ambassador Alexander Matsegora told the outlet. He also said children of Russian troops killed in Ukraine had vacationed in North Korea last summer, and Russia and North Korea are developing student exchanges.
North Korean drones
South Korean officials have echoed US concerns that the deepening partnership between Russia and North Korea could facilitate technology transfers to the Kim regime.
This week, Kim oversaw a test of new AI-powered attack drones, North Korean state-run news agency KCNA reported, and directed that they be further developed “in keeping with the trend of modern warfare.”
Pyongyang also unveiled a new reconnaissance drone that could have partly come from Russia, South Korea’s military said Thursday.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Seong-jun said that the aircraft model had been modified from an original North Korean plane, but the “internal equipment and such parts could be related to Russia.”
Drones have become a central weapon in the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The number of Russian drone attacks on Ukraine skyrocketed from just 379 in May 2024 to nearly 2,500 in November.
Amid ongoing talks of a ceasefire, Ukraine and Russia have continued to exchange attacks. Late Wednesday, Russian forces launched a massive drone attack on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, injuring at least nine people and damaging civilian infrastructure, Ukrainian authorities said.
“No country should have to go through this,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram following the attack.",['Lex Harvey'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/world/russia-sanctions-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html,European leaders say now not the time to lift sanctions on Russia in clear message to Trump,2025-03-27 14:23:01,"Ukraine’s European allies say now is not the time for lifting sanctions on Russia, in a clear message to the Trump administration as Moscow pushes Washington for concessions ahead of signing a US brokered deal on ending the fighting in the Black Sea.
The leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany all affirmed at a summit on Thursday that Europe will not lift sanctions on Russia – a strong and seemingly coordinated nod to the Trump administration, which has said it is still evaluating the Kremlin’s demands.
They spoke after a meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” in Paris which discussed how to bolster support for Kyiv and what role they might play if a peace deal is struck with Russia.
The Trump administration’s willingness to embrace Moscow as he seeks a quick end to the war against Ukraine, which has included vocal support for key Russian demands even before talks had even begun, has alarmed European allies.
While divisions remain among European leaders about how to respond, they spoke in unison on Russia’s demand to ease sanctions.
“(There is) complete clarity that now is not the time for lifting of sanctions,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.
“Quite the contrary – what we discussed is how we can increase sanctions to support the US initiative, to bring Russia to the table through further pressure from this group of countries,” the British Prime Minister said, still striking a conciliatory tone toward the United States.
Starmer said the meeting involved more than 30 countries, including Ukraine’s European allies and NATO officials. He described the meeting as “very constructive.”
Echoing Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said stopping sanctions would be a “serious mistake.”
“It makes no sense to end the sanctions until peace has actually been achieved, and unfortunately we are still a long way from that, as you can see.”
This week the US announced that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to end fighting in the Black Sea. But Moscow soon followed up the statement by saying it would only implement the deal once some of the sanctions imposed on Russian banks and exports over its invasion of Ukraine are lifted.

“I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they’re dragging their feet. I’ve done it over the years,” the president told the right-wing cable channel Newsmax in an interview that aired Tuesday night.
“I think Russia would like to see it end and I think (Ukraine’s President Volodymyr) Zelensky would like to see it end, at this point,” Trump said.
His comments came only hours after Russia said it would only implement a US-brokered deal to stop using force in the Black Sea once some of the sanctions imposed on its banks and exports over its invasion of Ukraine are lifted.
Following days of separate negotiations with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, the White House said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed “to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”
But while Zelensky confirmed in a news conference that Ukraine had agreed to stop using military force in the Black Sea, the Kremlin released its own statement on the talks, which included far-reaching conditions for signing up to the partial truce.
Those included lifting sanctions on its agricultural bank and other financial institutions and companies involved in exporting food and their re-connection to the SWIFT international payments system.
The US statements made no mention of the sanctions being lifted as a precondition to the ceasefire.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said his administration was looking at Russia’s conditions. “We’re thinking about all of them right now. There are five or six conditions. We are looking at all of them,” he said.
On Wednesday, Zelensky said sanctions against Russia needed to remain as it continues to occupy Ukrainian territory and that he expects the US to secure the Black Sea agreement without conditions.
“We expect the American side to secure the unconditionality of silence in the sea,” the Ukrainian president said alongside his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris on Wednesday evening.
His remarks came ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing” – a group of Western nations that have pledged to help defend Ukraine against Russia.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN Wednesday that Moscow does not believe Zelensky fully grasps the changed nature of US-Russia relations.
“I don’t think so,” Peskov said in a text message when asked about the Ukrainian leader’s comments that Moscow was trying to write additional conditions into the agreement.
Peskov also criticized Zelensky, saying he had “no doubt he remembers the previous Black Sea deal with all the details! … The one that was not implemented in the part of Russia.”
Peskov was referring to the Black Sea grain initiative, which was in place earlier in the war, was signed in July 2022 and renewed three times before Russia allowed it to lapse in July 2023, saying that its demands had not been met including the lifting of sanctions.
Meanwhile, Macron said Russia had shown a “desire for war” by putting conditions on the US-brokered deal. The French president added that Russia had offered “no solid answer” to the US-proposed 30-day ceasefire.
“Russia will not have a say on the support that we give and will give to Ukraine, nor will they dictate the conditions on this durable peace because it’s about the sovereignty of Ukraine and the security of all Europeans,” he added.
Macron continued, “I will not let history be rewritten by the lies of certain people, there is only one aggressor and there’s only one who resists. Russia is the aggressor, and you (Zelensky) are resisting.”
Overnight drone attack
The White House said that Russia and Ukraine also agreed to implement a previously announced pause on attacks against energy infrastructure.
But details of that agreement have also remained opaque. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said that Russia stopped targeting energy infrastructure from March 18, when Trump and Putin held a phone call in which they discussed the proposal.
However, Ukraine has accused Moscow of continuing to attack its infrastructure in the past week, with an aide to Zelensky saying there had been at least eight strikes.
At the same time, Russia accused Kyiv of attacking its own facilities, including an oil pumping station in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar.
Further indications that a meaningful truce was long way off came overnight when Russia launched over 100 drones towards Ukraine, after three Ukrainian civilians were killed on Tuesday, including a three-year old girl and her mother, Kyiv said.
Zelensky said the attacks, which targeted multiple regions of Ukraine showed Russia was not interested in a ceasefire.
“Launching such large-scale attacks after ceasefire negotiations is a clear signal to the whole world that Moscow is not going to pursue real peace,” the Ukrainian leader said on X on Wednesday morning.
Black Sea ceasefire could impact Ukraine
Ukrainian and US officials have said the deal to halt strikes in the Black Sea would be a potentially significant step forward, despite it falling short of the 30-day full ceasefire initially proposed by the White House.
But some analysts have pointed out that a ceasefire in the Black Sea and a pause on strikes against energy infrastructure could be disadvantageous to Ukraine.
Some of Ukraine’s biggest military wins have taken place in the Black Sea – it repeatedly successfully struck the Russian fleet and the Kerch Bridge that links Russia with Crimea.
The sinking of the Moskva, one of the Russian Navy’s most important warships, gave a massive boost to Ukraine’s morale and remains among the most significant moments of the war – even though the two sides disagree on why it happened, with Ukraine saying it went down after being hit by a missile and Russia claiming it sunk because of a fire and a subsequent ammunition explosion.
Similarly, Ukraine’s ability to strike against oil depots and other energy facilities deep inside Russian territory have caused major headaches for Moscow, which has long relied on energy exports revenues to fund its war effort.
“The United States should amplify and accelerate not constrain these effective asymmetric warfare approaches (by Ukraine) that also impact Russia’s battlefield operations and force Putin to make hard choices about resource allocation,” analysts at the Institute for the Study of War said in their daily note on Wednesday.","['Angus Watson', 'Jessie Yeung', 'Ivana Kottasová', 'Anna Chernova']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/europe/russia-jail-azov-fighters-intl/index.html,Russian court hands long jail terms to Ukrainian fighters who defended Mariupol,2025-03-26 14:18:49,"A Russian military court has handed down long prison sentences to several members of Ukraine’s Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the key city of Mariupol during the early months of the war.
The defendants were convicted on Wednesday of charges including violent seizure of power and participation in a terrorist organization and given prison terms ranging from 13 to 23 years, according to the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia.
Russia has sought to paint the Azov Regiment as made up of Nazis and nationalists, allegations the group denies, and the US last year lifted a ban on supplying them weapons.
The city of Mariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, after Ukrainian soldiers, including members of the Azov unit, and residents sheltered for weeks underground in 2022 at the city’s massive Azovstal steelworks plant refusing to surrender to Russian forces.
The Southern District Military Court in Rostov-on-Don announced the verdict in absentia for 11 individuals, while 12 appeared in person. One member reportedly died in Russian detention, while others have since been exchanged.
The case involved members of the Azov regiment — now part of Ukraine’s National Guard — captured during the siege of Mariupol.
According to the prosecution, the court established the individuals took “actions aimed at the violent change of the constitutional order of Russia.” Russian authorities designated the Azov unit a terrorist group in 2022, after it started the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The trial, initially dubbed “the case of 24,” involved Ukrainian prisoner of war Oleksandr Ishchenko, who died in a Russian pretrial detention center as a result of a closed chest injury due to “contact with a blunt object,” according to Azov commander Svyatoslav Palamar citing a Ukrainian forensic expert.
Russian human rights organization Memorial designated the defendants political prisoners and said there was evidence of violations, including “cruel treatment, excruciating conditions of detention, lack of normal food and medical care, insults, bullying, beatings and torture.”
The sentencing coincided with Ukraine’s National Guard Day, which President Volodymyr Zelensky marked by praising the bravery of National Guard units and reaffirming Kyiv’s diplomatic efforts to free all Ukrainian prisoners of war, including Azov fighters.
Zelensky said Kyiv remembers “all Ukrainian warriors – in particular, National Guard warriors, defenders of Mariupol, and Azov fighters, who, unfortunately, remain in Russian captivity.”
“We are working at all levels of diplomacy to free them and bring them home,” he said.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/europe/russia-us-ukraine-deal-intl-hnk/index.html,Moscow sets far-reaching conditions for implementing US-brokered Black Sea ceasefire,2025-03-25 11:57:22,"Russia will only implement a White House-brokered agreement to stop using force in the Black Sea when sanctions imposed on its banks and exports over its invasion of Ukraine are lifted, the Kremlin said Tuesday, adding further uncertainty to both ongoing peace negotiations and the wider ambition of establishing a full cease-fire.
Following days of separate talks with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, the White House said the two sides had agreed “to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea” while also agreeing to implement a previously announced pause on attacks against energy infrastructure.
The agreements – which represent a potentially significant step forward, while falling far short of a 30-day full ceasefire initially proposed by the White House – were outlined in two separate, but very similar statements from the White House on Tuesday.
But while Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed in a news conference that Ukraine had agreed to stop using military force in the Black Sea, the Kremlin released its own statement on the talks, which included far-reaching conditions for signing up to the partial truce.
Those included lifting sanctions on its agricultural bank and other financial institutions and companies involved in exporting food and their re-connection to the US-controlled SWIFT international payments system.
Those sanctions were imposed after Moscow launched its unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
On Tuesday afternoon, US President Donald Trump told reporters that his administration was looking at Russia’s conditions. “We’re thinking about all of them right now. There are five or six conditions. We are looking at all of them,” the US president said at the White House.
The Russian stipulations raise fresh questions as to how or when such a limited agreement could be implemented, and highlight what remains a significant gulf in expectations between the two warring sides.
In his nightly address, Zelensky accused Moscow of trying to deceive mediators by adding new terms. “They are already trying to twist the agreements and actually deceive both our mediators and the whole world,” he said.
The White House’s statements on the agreement with Russia made no explicit mention of Moscow’s conditions but the US appeared to have offered different rewards to Kyiv and Moscow for sticking to their side of the bargain.
It included a promise that it would “help restore Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions” – a possible indication of willingness by the US to lift some of its strict economic sanctions.
The details and timeline of relaxing restrictions remain unclear, as does the future of European sanctions. Kyiv and its European allies have previously warned against lifting sanctions before a ceasefire is in place.
Strikes on energy facilities
The two White House statements also made clear both Ukraine and Russia had separately agreed to “develop measures for implementing” an agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities, in an extension of the previously announced partial truce.
Zelensky confirmed this part of the agreement, adding that Ukraine had provided the US with a list of energy facilities it would like to be protected.
The Kremlin said it had agreed on the list of Ukrainian and Russian energy facilities that would be off-limits, which included oil refineries, oil and gas pipelines, storage facilities, pumping stations, electricity power plants, substations, transformers, and distributors.
It added that attacks on Russian and Ukrainian nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams would also be prohibited “under the temporary moratorium on attacks on the energy system.” The moratorium began on March 18 and would be in effect for 30 days but could be extended, the Kremlin added.
Zelensky later rejected Moscow’s claim that a pause on attacking the other’s energy infrastructure had begun.
“There is something that the Kremlin is lying about again: that the alleged silence in the Black Sea depends on the issue of sanctions and that the alleged date of the beginning of the silence on energy is 18 March,” he said. Moscow always lies.”
In the statement outlining the results of the talks with Ukraine, the White House said the US “remains committed to helping achieve the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.”
As the Trump administration pushes for peace in Ukraine, Russian officials have previously indicated interest in US-led proposals, accompanied by strenuous conditions. Earlier this month, after Kyiv accepted a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire covering the entire front line, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he “agreed with the proposal” in spirit but requested a number of concessions before signing up to it.
No joint statement from US and Russia
The White House statements came after lengthy talks between the two sides on a potential ceasefire in Ukraine ended without a joint statement, despite expectations.
The Russian state news agency Interfax quoted the first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Council’s Defence and Security Committee, Vladimir Chizhov, as telling state TV channel Rossiya-24 that the statement was “not adopted because of Ukraine’s position.”
“The fact that they sat for 12 hours and seemed to agree on a joint statement, which however was not adopted due t o Ukraine’s position, is also very characteristic and symptomatic,” Chizhov told Russia-24, according to Interfax.
Kyiv was not represented in the talks and Chizhov did not give any details on “Ukraine’s position.”
Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine one of his primary foreign policy goals. During his election campaign he went as far as promising he would achieve peace within 24 hours of being in office, something that more than three months in has so far remained elusive.
Instead of a full truce, or a partial resolution of fundamental issues, such as the division of territory, the White House statements on Tuesday outlined an agreement similar to the Black Sea grain initiative that was in place earlier in the war.
Brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, the deal allowed Ukraine to export grain by sea, with ships bypassing a Russian blockade of the country’s Black Sea ports and navigating safe passage through the waterway to Turkey’s Bosphorus Strait in order to reach global markets. Ukraine was one of the world’s leading grain exporters before Russia’s full-scale invasion.
The initiative was signed in July 2022 and renewed three times before Russia allowed it to lapse in July 2023, saying that its demands had not been met. Moscow had for some time complained that it had been prevented from adequately exporting its own foodstuffs under the deal.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Christian Edwards', 'Anna Chernova', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Kevin Liptak', 'Angus Watson']",en

But with the Kremlin, there’s always a rub",2025-03-25 22:02:06,"It’s not the full 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine that US President Donald Trump demanded – far from it. But it is a deal with both Russia and Ukraine and, therefore, a rare sign of progress.
The White House announced Tuesday that both Ukraine and Russia have agreed to a limited deal restricting military action in the Black Sea – albeit with several conditions.
The key part of the agreement seeks to ensure safe passage for commercial shipping and to stop military strikes in the Black Sea. Russia and Ukraine would essentially get back unfettered access to ports crucial for their exports of grain and other agricultural produce.
Ukraine, which has waged a devastatingly successful drone campaign against the Russian Black Sea Fleet, has made clear that any return movement of Russian naval vessels would be seen by them as a violation.
A second part of the agreement includes the US and Russia developing measures to halt strikes on Russian and Ukrainian energy facilities for a period of 30 days – yet more progress, albeit partial.
But with the Kremlin there is always a rub.
After the agreement was announced, the Kremlin revealed it would only implement it after a series of sanctions had been lifted on its financial institutions involved in agricultural trade.
This would be sanctions relief via the back door.
Among other things, this is likely to include a restoration of Russia’s access, at least in part, to the US-controlled SWIFT international payments system, from which Russia has been excluded since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
The Trump administration has already made breathtaking concessions to the Kremlin, taking Ukrainian NATO membership off the table and forcing Kyiv to accept territorial losses, in what remains a yet unsuccessful bid to forge peace in Ukraine.
Lifting sanctions designed to punish Moscow – which are currently causing real economic pain there – without even a short-term ceasefire commitment from the Kremlin in return, risks looking like yet another capitulation to Putin. It’s certainly one of the main things Putin wants.
Trump, who insists he remains determined to end the bloodshed in Ukraine, has found himself confronted with the complex reality of even pausing this brutal war, exploited by Putin’s tough and seasoned negotiators.
It’s worth remembering how Trump repeatedly boasted he could end the conflict in just 24 hours, later revising that to a more realistic, but still wildly ambitious, timeframe.
Now, the bar for success seems to be a short pause in the killing and, as the latest agreement has starkly underlined, even that remains elusive.
The crucial question, though, is whether this creeping ceasefire is the start of a real peace process that may develop into an actual cessation of hostilities and even a lasting peace in Ukraine.
Or will it turn out to be yet another false dawn, an agreement that leads nowhere or even, as many Ukrainians fear, toward a gradual surrender to Moscow.",['Matthew Chance'],en

The attack on the facility in Sudzha comes just days after the US proposed both sides pause attacks on energy infrastructure.
The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Kyiv had “deliberately attacked” the station, which has been under Ukrainian control since Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Kursk in August 2024.
Moscow claims Ukrainian forces blew up the facility while “retreating from the Kursk region” with the aim of “discrediting the US president’s peace initiatives.”
On Saturday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry further warned that it “reserves the right to respond, including with a symmetrical response” to what it claims were Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure facilities.
Kyiv has described those accusations as “groundless” and claimed they are aimed at discrediting Ukraine and misleading the international community.
“Indeed, the station has been repeatedly shelled by the Russians themselves,” Ukraine’s General Staff said in a Telegram post on Friday.
According to the Ukrainian military, Russia struck the same station with missiles as recently as three days ago.
“The attempts by the Russians to deceive everyone and pretend that they are adhering to the ceasefire will not work, (neither) will the fake news about the strikes on the gas station,” Ukraine’s Presidential Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak posted on X Friday.
The Sudzha gas metering station was the last route through which Russian natural gas was delivered to Europe through Ukraine. Natural gas transportation through Sudzha was terminated on the morning of January 1, 2025, after Kyiv refused to renew the contract.
The attack on the station comes more than a week after the announcement by Russian forces that they had recaptured Sudzha, the largest town that Ukraine has occupied during its incursion into Kursk. Ukraine’s occupation of parts of Kursk is seen as its sole territorial bargaining chip amid pressure to negotiate an end to the war.
Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy targets in Ukraine after a lengthy telephone call with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, though he stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire to end the three-year-long conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also said he would support a pause on striking energy targets.
Talks to pause the conflict will take place in Riyadh next week, with a US delegation expected to first sit down with the Ukrainians followed by the Russians on Monday.","['Mariya Knight', 'Maria Kostenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/22/europe/russia-putin-ultimate-goals-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html,Trump wants the war to end. But Putin wants much more than that,2025-03-22 00:00:00,"US President Donald Trump said he thinks Vladimir Putin wants peace. Ukraine and its European allies don’t believe he does, while the Russian leader himself said he wants peace but then refused to sign up to it when presented with the option.
What Putin really wants, though, is much, much bigger.
The Russian president has made no secret of the fact that he believes Ukraine should not exist as an independent state and he has repeatedly said he wants NATO to shrink back to its Cold War-era size.
But more than anything, he wants to see a new global order — and he wants Russia to play the starring role in it.
Putin and several of his most trusted allies emerged from the remnants of the KGB, the Soviet-era intelligence agency. They have never forgotten the humiliation of the fall of the Soviet Union and are not happy with the way the world has turned out since then.
Putin rose to power during the chaos of the 1990s, when the Russian economy collapsed and had to be rescued by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – another humiliation for the former superpower.
But from 2000, when Putin became president, steadily rising oil prices made Russia and many Russians richer than ever before. And Russia had a voice. It was invited into the G7 group of the world’s largest economies – renamed the G8 after it joined.
But this was not enough for the Russian leader, Kristine Berzina, a managing director at the German Marshal Fund of United States, told CNN.
“Putin was happy to throw all that away on behalf of his citizens because of higher geopolitical aims,” Berzina said. Russia was expelled from the G8, sanctioned by the West and ostracized on the global stage because of its aggression against Ukraine.
Berzina said it was never good enough for Russia to be “the eighth in the G7.”
“That doesn’t work within Russia’s understanding of its own exceptionalism. It is the largest country in the world, the richest in (natural) resources, so how can it simply be one of the players?” she said.
To understand what Putin wants from the current talks with the US, it’s key to remember that the two sides are talking because the United States made a policy U-turn under Trump — not because of a fundamental change in Russian thinking.
Trump wants the war in Ukraine to end as soon as possible, even if it means further territorial losses for Ukraine.
This means Putin has little to lose from talking.
Trump has claimed that “Russia holds all the cards” in the war with Ukraine, but the battlefield has been mostly stalled for the past two years.
While Russia is making some incremental gains, it is definitely not winning – though this could change if the US was to stop supplying arms and intelligence to Ukraine.
“Putin went into Ukraine thinking that it will be an easy, quick operation. Three years on, he controls 20% of Ukraine, but at terrible, terrible cost. I mean, essentially the Russians are losing. The thing though is that the Ukrainians are losing faster,” leading Russia analyst Mark Galeotti told CNN.
For Putin and the people around him, Trump’s push for a ceasefire simply presents an opportunity to secure quick wins while keeping an eye on the long-term goals, he said.
“Putin is an opportunist. He likes creating dynamic, chaotic situations, which throw up a whole variety of opportunities. And then he can then just pick which opportunity appeals to him, and he can change his mind,” Galeotti said.
Long term plan
Putin and his aides have made it very clear that their long-term goals have not changed. Even as they talk about wanting peace, Russian officials have continued to insist that the “root causes” of the conflict in Ukraine must be “eliminated.”
In the Kremlin’s view, these “root causes” amount to Ukraine’s sovereignty and its democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as NATO’s expansion to the east in the past 30 years.
Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 to force a regime change in Kyiv, planning to install a pro-Moscow government. His goal was to turn Ukraine into a vassal state like Belarus and prevent it from joining the European Union and NATO in the future.
He has not achieved that goal by using military force, but that doesn’t mean he has abandoned it.
Instead, he might try to achieve it by other means.
“The easiest way for Russia to attain what it wants in a different country is not through military means, but through interference and electoral process,” Berzina said, adding that it is possible – even likely – that this is what Moscow would try to do after a ceasefire was in place.
This is likely why Russia keeps questioning Zelensky’s legitimacy and pushing for an election – and why Kremlin was delighted when Trump adopted this narrative and called the Ukrainian leader “a dictator without elections.” Ukraine’s martial law – imposed because of Russia’s aggression – prohibits elections from taking place while the conflict is ongoing.
Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, have rejected the idea that Ukraine could join NATO any time soon and Putin has asked for a US commitment that this will not happen to be part of any ceasefire agreement.
But Berzina said that Ukraine’s European allies are not buying Putin’s promises that he would stop fighting if Ukraine became – as he called it – neutral.
“No matter what Trump and Putin think they can arrange this week or this year, many people in Europe now find Putin fundamentally untrustworthy,” she said.
“Could there be a desire for Russia to try its hand again militarily? Sure. And that is why the Europeans are very clear-eyed on the potential for future military engagement.”
It’s all personal
Andrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist and security expert who lives in exile in London, said Putin and his aides believe they can “try to get something out of Trump right now.”
“They think they can win some tactical battles but that he would not give them what they really want, which is a complete rearrangement of security arrangements in Europe,” he said.
“For the Kremlin, it’s not a war with Ukraine, it’s a war with the West, and a lot of people in Moscow don’t really believe that they can get any kind of lasting agreement with the US,” Soldatov told CNN.
Russia’s wariness of the US goes far back.
“It’s very personal to them because they were all young KGB officers back then, and they lost their social standing, they lost a place in Russian society, they lost the country as they describe it now, and it was extremely humiliating,” Soldatov said.
“They really believe that the West has been after the complete destruction and subjugation of Russia for centuries. It’s not just propaganda, they really, really believe in this.” But Putin has also framed his plan for Ukraine within his own – inaccurate — interpretation of history, which goes well beyond the fall of the Soviet Union. Putin has often argued that Ukraine is not a real country because Ukraine and Ukrainians are part of a larger “historical Russia”
Experts say this is, of course, nonsense.
“What he’s talking about is the fact that Russia and Ukraine and Belarus share a political ancestor called Rus … but it’s very much not the same thing as any modern country. It was an early to late medieval political entity and to say that Ukraine doesn’t have a right to exist because of this shared ancestor — no country looks the same as in the 10th century,” said Monica White, an associate professor in Russian and Slavonic Studies at the University of Nottingham.
Putin has also often turned to Russia’s religious identity in support of his plan. The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is one of the loudest supporters of the war.
“After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia lost its connection with the ancestral Orthodox lands and I think part of Putin’s project is to try to bring back that thread connecting 10th century Rus with this pure orthodox continuity,” White said. “What he’s doing is actually not so different from some of the early Romanov Tzars who kept trying to get back the Orthodox lands that were under either Ottoman or Catholic rule, and they eventually did.”
Putin’s overwhelming desire is to return Russia to the global stage with a bang, she suggests – by creating a wedge between Europe and the US and teaming up with the West’s other adversaries.
“Russia wants to be at all the important tables – so whatever comes next, maybe it doesn’t have to mean territorial conquest in Europe, but I think it does have to be in a starring role in the more powerful bloc, if it sees that to include China or Iran or others, a bloc that is defined by its willingness to disrupt and destabilize,” White added.
Putin clearly believes that Russia – the largest country in the world by area – should be involved in running the world. He might have a like-minded man in the White House. Trump has made it clear that he believes the biggest and most powerful countries should get what they want – whether it’s Greenland, the Panama Canal, or a chunk of Ukraine.
“I think that the fundamental point is that, as far as Trump is concerned, Ukraine is a bought and paid for vassal state and has to understand its place and accept that, essentially, America will work out some kind of a deal with Russia and then bring it back to Ukraine,” Galeotti said.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

Trump – who recently held separate phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky on implementing a partial ceasefire – projected optimism about reaching an end to the war on Thursday, saying “we’re doing pretty well in that regard.”
Delegations from Russia and the US are expected to resume talks on ending the war on Monday in Saudi Arabia, both countries’ officials said, following an earlier round of talks in February.
Zelensky said a team from Ukraine will also attend, with parallel meetings likely to take place, and urged Putin to “stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war.”
“I believe we’ll get it done. We’ll see what happens,” Trump said on Thursday, referring to the talks.
Hours after Trump spoke, Russia launched a “massive” drone attack on Odesa, hitting civilian targets and injuring at least three people, including a minor, local officials said.
A high-rise residential building and a shopping center were among the targets, local governor Oleh Kiper said.
Videos shared on social media show what appears to be civilian infrastructure on fire and huge plumes of smoke rising over the city. CNN has not been able to immediately verify the videos.
Czech President Peter Pavel was in the port city on an official visit at the time of the attack, Ukrainian official Oleksiy Kuleba said.
Meanwhile, Russian assaults wounded at least five others near the southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Thursday, local governor Ivan Fedorov said.
Nearly 200 drones also hit the Kirovohrad region in central Ukraine overnight into Thursday, wounding 10 people, including four children, and damaging homes, a church, and key infrastructure, Zelensky said.
“Russian strikes on Ukraine do not stop, despite their propaganda claims. Every day and every night, nearly a hundred or more drones are launched, along with ongoing missile attacks. With each such launch, the Russians expose to the world their true attitude towards peace,” Zelensky said Thursday on X.
Ukraine and Russia have exchanged aerial assaults in the days since the Kremlin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy infrastructure targets, but stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire sought by the US.
Overnight into Thursday, Ukraine struck a military airfield deep inside Russian territory, sparking a huge explosion and destroying nearby houses, Russian and Ukrainian officials said.
Ukraine’s military confirmed it was behind the attack on Engels airbase - more than 465 miles from the Ukrainian border - saying it targeted the airbase because it is used by Russia’s air force “to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine and terrorist attacks against the civilian population.”
Zelensky on Wednesday accused Putin of already breaking his pledge, saying that Russia attacked Ukraine with 150 drones, including strikes on energy facilities.
Zelensky has said he is “ready” to pause attacks on Russia’s energy and civilian infrastructure, saying his team will prepare a list of civilian targets to be included in a future deal.
Ukraine “unconditionally agrees” to a ceasefire, but is “waiting for the aggressor to agree,” Zelensky said Thursday while speaking at a press conference in Norway.
Putin announced the halt on energy infrastructure attacks on Tuesday after a lengthy call with Trump. “Vladimir Putin responded positively to this initiative and immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order,” a Kremlin readout said.
As part of its demands for a broader ceasefire, the Kremlin laid out several tough conditions that Putin had previously insisted on – such as a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence to Kyiv, and a halt to any Ukrainian mobilization or rearming during that period.
Zelensky spoke to European leaders on Thursday as they reaffirmed their support for Ukraine, calling on other Western leaders to match words of support for Kyiv with deeds, as Trump escalates his courting of Russia.
“The stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiation table,” the European Union’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas said of the Ukrainians, according to Reuters.
The meetings in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh on Monday are designed for US and Russian officials to hammer out more specific language on the deal reached by Trump and Putin, as well as other areas of negotiation toward a full ceasefire. The talks won’t involve Cabinet-level US officials, the State Department said Wednesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/21/business/europe-russia-frozen-assets-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html,Europe needs money to back Ukraine. Why is it reluctant to spend Russia’s?,2025-03-21 06:01:52,"Three years of war in Ukraine have left Europe with a hefty bill: nearly $122 billion in direct assistance, plus billions more plowed into the continent’s militaries and defense industry.
But the region has so far refused to touch the $229 billion of Russian central bank cash sitting in the European Union, frozen after Vladimir Putin’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Last week, however, French lawmakers passed a non-binding resolution calling on their government to use frozen Russian assets to “finance military support to Ukraine and its reconstruction” – specifically, the assets themselves rather than just the interest they are earning.
Both the United States and Canada had already introduced legislation empowering governments to confiscate frozen Russian assets. In its final days, the Biden administration also tried to persuade European allies to confiscate immobilized Russian funds.
Some progress on that front was achieved last week, when the European Parliament agreed on a resolution to confiscate Russian frozen assets for Ukraine’s “defense and reconstruction.” The text of the resolution has not yet been voted on by the parliament’s lawmakers.
The EU is already using the interest from the frozen funds to back multi-billion-dollar loans to Ukraine. But European governments remain hesitant about confiscating the capital. In an understatement from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on March 15, it’s a “complicated issue.”
Mountain of cash
The concerns are twofold: economic and legal.
“We’re not touching these Russian assets,” French government spokesperson Sophie Primas told journalists last Wednesday, warning that doing so could set a dangerous precedent, discouraging foreign investment in Europe, even as the government examines legal pathways to use the funds.
A country like China, aware that it could face European sanctions if it invaded Taiwan, might be reluctant to place funds in the region, the argument goes.
Indeed, Russia has for years been moving its official funds out of the US, apparently fearful of repercussions over its aggressions in Ukraine and Georgia.
There is a precedent for this sort of US action. It seized German assets after World War II, as well as Afghan and Iraqi assets, said Professor Olena Havrylchyk, an economist at Paris’ Panthéon-Sorbonne university, adding that Moscow hadn’t had the same fear about Europe.
In recent years, Europe’s central banks have expressed concern (cloaked in diplomatic language) that seizing foreign funds could “harm the euro as a reserve currency,” Havrylchyk told CNN.
But continued support for Ukraine will carry on costing Europe money – and interest from Russia’s funds won’t cut it.
That’s a reality that European taxpayers will need to remain on board with, Havrylchyk said, if seizing Russia’s money outright is off the table.
Havrylchyk believes a nuclear-armed Russia will never agree to pay reparations as part of a peace deal, so Kyiv’s hopes for compensation must lie in funds already in the West’s hands.
“The world isn’t ruled solely by economists,” she said. “International law is above all for justice, not just property rights.”
Legal worries
Legally, Europe’s hesitancy over seizing – rather than just freezing – Russia’s assets stems from one of the key principles of international law: the immunity of a state’s overseas assets from seizure.
The justification for seizing the principal of Russia’s assets would therefore be all-important, Frédéric Dopagne, professor of public international law at the University of Louvain in Belgium, told CNN.
Reparations for Russia’s damage to Ukraine and bolstering Ukraine’s own defense capabilities against aggression are the strongest legal arguments Europe could use, he added.
When the US passed the 2024 bipartisan Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act, it justified any seizing of Russia’s assets in the US on the basis that they would be used to rebuild Ukraine. And French lawmakers debating the non-binding resolution last Wednesday voted through an amendment explicitly removing provisions to use Russian assets to fund Europe’s own defense.
With around two-thirds of all frozen Russian funds sitting in the EU, the stakes – and potential benefits – are much higher for European governments than they are for the US.
Dopagne at the University of Louvain said Europe’s hesitancy is partly due to the lack of historical precedent.
After World Wars I and II, a vanquished Germany was compelled to pay reparations through international treaties. But, with even a 30-day ceasefire off the table for Moscow, any such post-war accord with Russia is a distant prospect, Dopagne said.
So, the question for Western decision-makers on Ukraine is: “Can we really have an agreement on reparations before we’ve even got a peace treaty?” Dopagne said.
“It would be a novelty,” he added, even if it can’t be ruled out.
Unanimous consent needed
The arguments on either side of the debate haven’t yet reached critical mass.
States like Belgium, which holds the lion’s share of frozen Russian assets (some $193 billion, according to the Institute of Legislative Ideas, a Ukrainian think tank), remain dubious, and backing from economic powerhouses like Germany would be essential for broader European buy-in.
Any EU-wide action would almost certainly require unanimous consent from member states, an unlikely result, given the support for Russia in the Hungarian and Slovak administrations.
Officials from the Biden administration had hoped to use Russia’s frozen funds as leverage in peace negotiations, forcing Putin to the table. With Donald Trump’s enthusiastic overtures to Moscow and the first moves toward a peace deal in three years of fighting, a European seizure of Russia’s cash is more likely to kill than to aid negotiations.

But it’s unclear how the operation would work in practice, experts say, especially as the plant is on the front line, in territory controlled by Russia.
As part of ongoing talks to inch toward a partial ceasefire, US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky “discussed Ukraine’s electrical supply and nuclear power plants” during a Wednesday phone call, according to the US readout of the call.
“(Trump) said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise. American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,” the readout said.
On Thursday, Zelensky disputed that section, saying: “In terms of ownership, we definitely did not discuss this with President Trump.” Zelensky stressed that “all nuclear power belongs to the (Ukrainian) state, including the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia region.”
Zelensky said the day before that Ukraine is ready to consider the possibility of American investment in the restoration and modernization of Zaporizhzhia. During a news conference after his call with Trump, Zelensky said they only discussed the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant, rather than Ukraine’s wider nuclear power network.
“I believe that the station will not work under occupation. I believe that the station can be restored to operation,” Zelensky said, also cautioning that the process will take an estimated two years or more.
Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the Zaporizhzhia plant supplied roughly 20% of Ukraine’s energy, with six reactors, making it the largest nuclear power station in Europe. Ukrainian staff remain at the plant under Russian occupation, and at one point staff were forced to work at “gunpoint.”
But the plant is now disconnected from the grid and the electricity infrastructure required to operate the plant safely has been damaged by drone strikes and frequent shelling. Russia also destroyed the nearby Kakhovka dam, emptying the reservoir that supplied water to cool the plant.
All six reactors are shut down and there are concerns over the plant’s ongoing maintenance, as explosions continue nearby, according to a UN nuclear watchdog team on the ground.
When asked about how the US could potentially run a Ukrainian nuclear plant, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox News that he didn’t believe it would require American troops on the ground.
“Certainly, we have immense technical expertise in the United States to run those plants. I don’t think that requires boots on the ground,” Wright said. “But I’ll leave the foreign policy to President Trump and Secretary (of State Marco) Rubio. I know they are working tirelessly, ‘How do we bring peace to Ukraine?’
“But, if it was helpful to achieve that end – have the US run nuclear power plants in Ukraine? No problem. We can do that,” Wright added.
But experts question how feasible the idea floated by the Trump administration would be.
Operating the plant safely would require a safe, constant power supply to avoid a reactor meltdown, as well as the restoration of sufficient water supplies for cooling the plant.
“The first word of business would be to establish definitively that there could be no attacks on either the plant directly or on the supporting infrastructure – both power and water resources – and that would have to be iron-clad,” said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “So far, that kind of agreement has been elusive, as shelling occurs at a daily basis in the vicinity of the reactors.”
“There’s no point in trying to rebuild a plant and operate it if it could be jeopardized at any moment,” Lyman said. “And the notion that US-ownership would somehow be more of a deterrent to Russia attacking the plant than now, when the Russians themselves control the plant, that doesn’t make sense either.”
The idea of US operation “raises a whole lot of logistical and technical and practical questions that are very unclear,” Lyman said, including the question of US liability for any accident at the facility. “With ownership or operator status comes responsibility.”
Nuclear experts have also highlighted that the US does not have any nuclear plants that use the same class of technology as Zaporizhzhia, which is a Soviet-designed “water water energetic reactor” (abbreviated as “VVER” in Russian).
“These are different technologies,” said Elena Sokova, director of the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, adding that there are strict licensing requirements for the plant’s operators.
“The US is an advanced country… but to be prepared to immediately take control of something that is of a different design, designed by different country, and where you have no experience of running it – I don’t think it’s a good solution or viable option.”
“Having said that, if we’re talking about a long process, I’m sure certain things could be worked out, particularly if there is an arrangement… to have the majority of the Ukrainian staff and operators running these reactors,” Sokova added.
Ukraine wants role in restoration of plant
Zelensky emphasized on Wednesday night that safe restoration of the plant is in the whole world’s interest, and Ukraine should have a role in that “because it is ours, and this is our land, this is our station.”
The Ukrainian president said any return of the plant would not be possible without control of the area where it is located – the city of Enerhodar – on the Russian-occupied side of the Zaporizhzhia region.
“If you just hand over the station, and a meter away from the station, everything is occupied or there are Russian weapons, no one will work like that,” Zelensky told reporters, raising concerns that the plant could be restored with US and Ukrainian investment, only to have Russia possibly damage or destroy it again later.
As fighting continues along the front line, the dire situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant “remains unchanged,” Andrian Prokip, energy program director at the Ukrainian Institute for the Future, wrote last month.
“It still does not receive adequate maintenance and it continues to serve as a Russian ammunition depot,” said Prokip, also a senior associate at the Wilson Center.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/politics/ukraine-war-trump-putin-zelensky-russia-diplomacy/index.html,How to decode a head-spinning few days of Ukraine war diplomacy,2025-03-19 00:00:00,"President Donald Trump’s calls with President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky this week represent the most intense diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion three years ago.
Early signs are discouraging, since Putin refused to sign up for Trump’s proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. But Trump is framing the opening of any dialogue as a triumph. And each leader is trying to manipulate the diplomacy to their own ends and playing the public relations game – not least to escape blame if everything falls apart.
The White House is spinning a fiction of significant progress both to keep alive the chances of a peace process developing and to support the increasingly tenuous conceit that Trump is a great dealmaker, uniquely able to forge peace.
Putin flatly refused Trump’s big ask on the ceasefire. Quite simply, he’s not ready to end the war yet, as can be seen from a new set of conditions that Ukraine could never agree to if it is to survive as a sovereign state. But the Kremlin also doesn’t want to alienate Trump, and it offered him the tantalizing glimpse of a great power relationship with Putin to draw the president in.
Zelensky is a quick learner. He can’t afford a repeat of the disastrous Oval Office blowup, and now readily agrees to almost everything Trump asks. Ironically, Zelensky’s meltdown-sparking argument – that Putin cannot be trusted to make or keep ceasefire agreements – has now been proven true.
Ukraine and Russia are each vying for the president’s attention and seeking to blame the other for impeding peace. After a violent night, each side accused the other of breaking the partial agreement brokered by the US president to avoid hitting energy infrastructure. Their estrangement over even this minor detail undermines Trump’s bullish statements that a peace deal is within reach.
The US ignores its initial failure and pushes ahead
The White House has publicly ignored Putin’s intransigence, praising the tone of his call with Trump on Tuesday and scheduling technical talks with the Russians in Saudi Arabia in the coming days.
Creating an illusion of progress can be an important aspect of peace negotiations, offering an incentive for warring sides to stay at the table. But in this case, the alternate reality seems also intended to spare the blushes of a president who predicted he’d solve the war within 24 hours if voters sent him back to the White House. In their phone call on Tuesday, Putin clearly got the better of a US president who is unwilling to impose any leverage on the Kremlin strongman.
On the other hand, Trump seems to have eased up on Zelensky, perhaps because of the Ukrainian president’s more flattering tone. He agreed in their hourlong call Wednesday to help locate vitally needed air defense equipment for Ukraine in Europe. And White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US would continue to provide military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. This is important because Trump cut off such assistance to force Kyiv to come to the table on his 30-day ceasefire plan. And it’s a rare rebuke to Putin, who made the halting of US military and intelligence resources for Ukraine a condition of joining a quest for permanent peace.
“Just completed a very good telephone call with President Zelensky of Ukraine. It lasted approximately one hour,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track.” Trump’s bullish assessment was almost absurdly upbeat. But it’s better than a few weeks ago when he was calling Zelensky a “dictator.”
After his calls with Putin and Zelensky, Trump’s dream of a peace deal seems further away than ever. Still, if all this week’s drama is somehow the start of a real push to conjure a fair and permanent settlement, Trump will prove his doubters wrong.
Russia hasn’t changed its goals since the invasion
The Trump administration is about to get a demonstration of Kremlin root-canal diplomacy. By agreeing in principle to the 30-day ceasefire but rejecting it in practice with a flurry of conditions requiring capitulation by Ukraine and the West, Putin stalled. Long negotiations on technical issues will give his forces time to exploit their current battlefield edge and eject Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region of Russia – one of Kyiv’s few territorial bargaining chips for any future peace talks.
Putin’s conditions for a peace deal – including the replacement of the current Ukrainian government, a demobilization of Kyiv’s forces and desire to see NATO retreat from Eastern Europe – haven’t changed.
At talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the coming days would test Moscow’s seriousness in the negotiations. “It’ll be up to them to say yes or no. I hope they’re going to say yes. And if they do, then I think we made great progress. If they say no, then we’ll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.” By Rubio’s own standards, Moscow has now answered in the negative. But he can’t say so for obvious political and diplomatic reasons and has no real choice but to keep pressing on.
Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen best summed up the current state of the talks, in an interview with CNN’s Isa Soares on Wednesday. “Trump wants peace. Europe wants peace. Ukraine wants peace. And there is only one missing – that’s Putin.”
Russia is unlikely to disengage, however. According to the Russian readout of their call on Tuesday, Putin offered Trump the chance to create the kind of broad relationship with Russia that he craves and that seems to cause the US leader to see the war in Ukraine as a sideshow. Next, the US wants to negotiate a Black Sea maritime ceasefire – and that’s fine with Putin too, since just like the proposed halt to attacks on energy infrastructure, it could deprive Kyiv of one of its most successful arenas of combat.
Ukraine has no choice but to play Trump’s game
Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz described Zelensky’s call with Trump as “fantastic.” This represents a diplomatic triumph for the Ukrainian president less than three weeks after he was kicked out of the Oval Office. Zelensky has moderated his approach, apparently reasoning that to spare his country from the worst of the US president’s pro-Putin instincts, he must be the party in the conflict most obviously working for peace, and, by extension, for the diplomatic triumph that Trump badly wants for his legacy.
The Ukrainian president laced his readout of his call with Trump with the gratitude and praise that he was accused of holding back during the Oval Office clash. He thanked Trump for a “good and productive start to the work.”
“We believe that together with America, with President Trump, and under American leadership, lasting peace can be achieved this year,” Zelensky said in a statement that was far more effusive about US efforts than anything the Russians have said. He did raise the key issue for Ukrainians in any peace deal: security guarantees that would be vital to preventing any new outbreaks of fighting after an agreement. And judging by the US readout of the call, he seems to have reacted favorably to a suggestion by the ever-transactional Trump that future US ownership of Ukrainian power stations could improve their security.
While humoring the White House, Ukraine is also working another track with the Europeans, who are building a “coalition of the willing” to aid Ukraine if Trump walks away. Zelensky’s top aide Andriy Yermak, for instance, pressed on Wednesday for the accelerated admission of his country to the European Union, which he said was vital to strengthening Europe’s security.",['Stephen Collinson'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/politics/researchers-lose-access-evidence-alleged-russian-war-crimes/index.html,Researchers have lost access to evidence of alleged Russian war crimes following Trump admin funding cut,2025-03-19 19:53:25,"Researchers have lost access to a major database of evidence on alleged Russian war crimes, including the locations of more than 30,000 abducted Ukrainian children, and funding for their work has been terminated, according to a letter from House lawmakers and a source familiar with the matter.
The Trump administration terminated financial support for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory, a State Department initiative launched in May 2022 “to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.” The funding was initially suspended as part of a sweeping foreign aid freeze in late January.
“The funding has been cut based on the assessments that we’ve been making regarding what was defining work within our framework of what was in America’s interests,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Wednesday.
The evidence collected by the Ukraine Conflict Observatory had been used in efforts to prosecute Russian officials for their alleged involvement in war crimes, including the International Criminal Court arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
According to a source familiar, when the funding was initially frozen, the database was turned off and researchers at Yale University lost access. The researchers have also lost access to all critical resources, like satellite imaging, needed to collect evidence of war crimes.
The database included information not only on the abduction of the Ukrainian children, but on other Russian war crimes as well: attacks on energy infrastructure, attacks on civilian infrastructure, and destruction of cultural sites, the source said.
The database was specifically structured to pull together relevant elements for prosecution of war crimes, the source said. It is unclear who has access to the database, what will happen to the critical evidence it holds, and whether it will be able to be shared with the entities like the European Union law enforcement agency Europol.
According to the letter from House lawmakers, Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) – which had been conducting research for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory – “compiled three reports, sourced from satellite imagery and biometric data, tracking identities and locations of over 30,000 children from Ukraine at dozens of locations.”
“This data is absolutely crucial to Ukraine’s efforts to return their children home,” the lawmakers said in the letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Wednesday.
The importance of returning “the forcibly transferred Ukrainian children” was a key topic in the meeting between top US and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah earlier this month, according to a joint statement after the meeting. In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Wednesday, President Donald Trump asked “about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted,” according to a statement about the call. “President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.”
Wednesday’s letter, led by Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman, noted that the evidence was being preserved “to be shared with Europol and the government of Ukraine to secure their return.”
“Yale HRL’s funding has been terminated and the status of the secure evidence repository is unknown. This vital resource cannot be lost,” it said.
The lawmakers said they have “reason to believe that the data from the repository has been permanently deleted.”
“If true, this would have devastating consequences,” wrote the 17 lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska.
Bruce and another State Department spokesperson said the data had not been deleted.
“The State Department does not hold the data for the Conflict Observatory. The data resides on a platform owned by MITRE as part of the program,” the unnamed spokesperson said, referring questions to the non-profit organization MITRE.
“To the best of MITRE’s knowledge and belief, the research data that was compiled has not been deleted and is currently maintained by a former partner on this contract. Department of State has been made aware of data disposition,” MITRE told CNN.",['Jennifer Hansler'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks-intl-hnk/index.html,"Ukraine and Russia exchange attacks overnight, hours after Trump-Putin call",2025-03-19 00:00:00,"Ukraine and Russia exchanged aerial assaults overnight, just hours after the Kremlin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy infrastructure targets, but stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire sought by the US.
President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump spoke by phone on Tuesday, with the Russian leader not agreeing to the 30-day truce that Trump has endorsed and Ukraine has agreed to. The White House said a narrower pause on attacking energy targets would go into effect followed by negotiations over a broader ceasefire.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday accused Putin of already breaking his pledge, saying that Russia attacked Ukraine with 150 drones overnight, including strikes on energy facilities.
The Kremlin also condemned an overnight attack on an oil facility in Russia, saying it showed Ukraine’s “lack of will” to reach a deal – although Kyiv was not part of the negotiation talks, and no formal agreement has been signed.
Zelensky said Tuesday that while Kyiv supported the pause in attacks on energy targets, he wanted to know the details behind the proposal that Trump and Putin discussed in their bilateral meeting.
“Putin essentially rejected the proposal of a comprehensive ceasefire. It would be right for the world to reject any attempts by Putin to draw out the war,” Zelensky said Tuesday night.
Zelensky and Trump spoke on the phone Wednesday, in a conversation that Trump described as “very good.” Trump said in a social media post that “much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.”
US national security adviser Mike Waltz said the US and Russian technical teams would meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days for further talks.
“I spoke today with my Russian counterpart Yuri Ushakov about President Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine. We agreed our technical teams would meet in Riyadh in the coming days to focus on implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire President Trump secured from Russia,” he wrote on X.
Overnight, Russia attacked Ukraine with 145 drones, 2 ballistic missiles, and 4 anti-aircraft missiles, Ukraine’s Air Force said Wednesday morning. The attacks targeted the Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. 72 drones were shot down, the air force said.
Civilian infrastructure was struck, including a hospital in the eastern Sumy region and an electricity system powering the railways in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, according to officials and Ukraine’s state railway company Ukrzaliznytsya.
Parts of the railway have been left without power, but trains are running as scheduled, the company said.
The attacks killed one person and injured 14 between Tuesday and Wednesday, according to a CNN tally of casualty figures shared by Ukrainian officials.
Zelensky said Wednesday that “Putin’s words are at odds with reality” following the overnight strikes. “When Putin said that he was allegedly ordering a halt to strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones overnight, including on energy facilities. There were strikes on transportation, unfortunately, two hospitals were hit, and on urban infrastructure,” Zelensky said during a news conference in Finland.
Meanwhile, Russia’s defense ministry said Wednesday it had shot down 57 drones launched by Ukraine overnight, with 35 of those intercepted and destroyed over the Kursk border region.
Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said a Ukrainian drone had caused a fire at an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya, Reuters reported. As of Wednesday morning, more than 200 personnel were on the ground working to extinguish the blaze, Russian officials said.
“Unfortunately, we see that there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime. There were attempts to strike our energy infrastructure facilities,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said following the overnight attacks.
Putin also said Wednesday that after a series of rapid operations, Russian forces are now “completing” the defeat of Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, where Kyiv launched its shock incursion last August.
Ukraine currently controls about 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) of Russia’s Kursk region at most, according to a Ukrainian commander who has been fighting in Kursk for six months.
Ukraine’s assault regiments are no longer on the attack, but they are still trying to hold positions, the commander of Ukraine’s 225th Separate Assault Regiment Oleh Shyriaiev told CNN on Tuesday.
“At the moment, we have to hold the lines to block the enemy’s advance,” said Shyriaiev, who was in one of the first groups of soldiers that entered the Kursk region in August. “The 225th regiment is not surrounded, the 225th regiment is fighting and we have a normal tactical position. It is difficult, but it is controlled.”
Maps published by the Ukrainian military show that Kyiv now controls only a sliver of ground inside Russia near the border. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that while forces have been pushed back, they are not encircled.
“The Russian grouping of troops began to act more confidently in the Kursk region,” Shyriaiev told CNN. “The first reason is their quantitative superiority. The enemy group is much larger than our group of troops. According to our data, the enemy’s grouping in the Kursk direction currently consists of 70,000 soldiers.”
The commander also said that the use of guided aerial bombs and North Korean soldiers contributed to Russia’s “rapid advancement.” He said North Korean troops’ assault tactics had become more modern in recent weeks.
“Even if we are now on the defensive, we are still grinding the enemy. (Russia) still suffers losses, both in terms of human casualties and losses of military equipment and weapons. This should also be taken into account,” he added. “Its losses, both now and over the entire period of the Kursk operation, are higher than the losses in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, much higher.”
Trump and Putin ‘trust each other,’ Kremlin says
Putin announced the halt on energy infrastructure attacks on Tuesday after his lengthy call with Trump. “Vladimir Putin responded positively to this initiative and immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order,” a Kremlin readout said.
As part of its demands for a broader ceasefire, the Kremlin readout laid out several tough conditions that Putin had previously insisted on – such as a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence to Kyiv, and a halt to any Ukrainian mobilization or rearming during that period.
“I can say with a high degree of confidence that Presidents Putin and Trump understand each other well, trust each other, and intend to gradually move towards normalizing Russian-American relations,” Peskov told reporters Wednesday, following the phone conversation between the leaders.
Peskov added that significant damage was done to US-Russia relations under former President Joe Biden, and restoring them will take time and effort. He also noted that Putin and Trump see “enormous potential” for major economic cooperation projects.
An expected prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine took place Wednesday, with 175 servicemen exchanged on each side, the Russian Defense Ministry said. “Also, as a goodwill gesture, 22 seriously wounded prisoners of war in need of urgent medical assistance” were handed over, the ministry added.
The statement said mediation efforts were provided by the United Arab Emirates. The Kremlin first announced the prisoner swap on Tuesday during a readout of the call between Putin and Trump. Zelensky said this was “a pre-arranged exchange. But in any case, exchanges are great for Ukraine.”

Before Arda Kardzhali’s game against Levski Sofia in Bulgaria’s First League on Sunday, both sets of players lined up near the center of the field to honor Arda’s former player, Petko Ganchev.
But before the game had finished, Arda published a statement on Facebook apologizing to Ganchev saying they had “received wrong information about his death.”
“The management of PFC Arda would like to express a huge apology to the former Arda player Petko Ganchev and his relatives after the club received wrong information about his death,” the club wrote.
“We wish Petko Ganchev many more years of good health and to enjoy the success of Arda.”
Arda and Levski Sofia would go onto draw the game 1-1.
In the aftermath of the incident, Ganchev detailed to Bulgarian media how he found out about the mistake from his former team.
“I don’t miss a chance to watch Arda matches on TV. Now against Levski, I was late about 10 minutes because I had some work,” Ganchev told Bulgarian news outlet Blitz. “While I was driving home, my phone started ringing a lot. But I’m driving and don’t dare to pick it up.
“I park in front of our house. I enter the yard and my wife welcomes me in tears. She says: ‘Petko, Petko, on the television they announced that you had passed!’ I couldn’t understand what she was telling me and what had happened. She explained that they called her on the phone and told her what they heard was announced ahead of the match between Arda and Levski.
“To bury you alive is very stressful. Truthfully, the situation was not pleasant, but at the end of the day, we have to be positive. Here, yesterday, when I heard the horrible news, I poured myself a small brandy,” Ganchev said with a smile.","['Ben Morse', 'Sam Krumov']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/politics/trump-putin-ceasefire-russia-ukraine-war/index.html,"After call with Trump, Putin agrees to pause attacks on Ukraine’s energy and infrastructure targets",2025-03-18 09:00:52,"Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy and infrastructure targets in Ukraine after a lengthy telephone call with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, the White House said, as Russia stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire to end the three-year-long conflict in Ukraine.
The Kremlin said following the call, that Trump “put forward a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days,” to which Putin “responded positively” and “immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order.”
The two men’s conversation, their second since Trump entered office, appeared unsuccessful in convincing Putin to sign off on the 30-day truce that Trump has endorsed and Ukraine has agreed to. Instead, the White House said a narrower pause on hitting energy targets would go into place, while technical teams begin sorting out other areas in negotiations.
“The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,” the White House wrote in its description of the call. It said the technical negotiations would begin “immediately” in the Middle East.
A temporary moratorium on energy attacks, though short of a full ceasefire, would still amount to the first instance of Russia agreeing to halt certain strikes since it invaded Ukraine in 2022. Both Moscow and Kyiv could benefit from the pause. Ukraine’s energy grid has been among the biggest targets of Putin’s invasion, which has left the country to suffer periodic blackouts even in the freezing cold winters. That has prompted Ukraine to target Russian oil facilities using long-range drones.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the results of the call were announced that he would support a pause on striking energy targets. “Both sides, Russian and Ukrainian, can cease attacking the energy sector. Our side is going to support this,” he said at a news conference, adding that it was “part of our proposal, about the sky and the sea.”
As part of its demands for a broader ceasefire, Putin stressed the need for a halt of foreign military aid to Ukraine, the Kremlin said, though the White House made no mention of that in its statement. And neither the White House nor the Kremlin brought up land concessions in their official descriptions of Tuesday’s conversation. Ahead of the call, Trump said US negotiators had discussed “dividing up certain assets.”
The high-stakes call, which lasted about two hours, came as the White House has insisted it was closing in on a temporary ceasefire deal to pause the war between Russia and Ukraine.
The call was a key test of whether Trump, who’s largely echoed Putin’s view of the war since their call last month, can achieve his campaign trail promise of bringing the war to an end – and whether his friendliness toward Russia has paid off.
“The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside,” the White House said in its statement. “This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.”
Putin told Trump that a prisoner exchange would occur between Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday, according to the Kremlin.
The White House also said the men discussed the Middle East “as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts” as Russia offers to mediate a nuclear deal with Iran.
Trump supported an idea proposed by Putin to organize US-Russia hockey matches in their respective countries, the Kremlin said.
Ahead of the call, sources familiar with the conversation said a key priority would be securing an agreement on concessions Russia is willing to make – including whether it’s willing to withdraw forces from territory it seized in the past three years since invading Ukraine.
Trump himself suggested as much while speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, saying that US negotiators have discussed “dividing up certain assets.”
“We’ll be talking about land. A lot of land is a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We’ll be talking about land, we’ll be talking about power plants, that’s a big question,” Trump said.
Negotiations to end the war kicked off after Trump and Putin spoke by phone last month, marking a resumption of communication after a long period of silence between the White House and the Kremlin. Since then, the president hosted Zelensky for an Oval Office meeting that ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouting at him and asking the Ukrainians to leave, followed by the US temporarily pausing military assistance and intelligence sharing.
Weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations between top US officials — led by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz — and top Ukrainian and Russian officials led to a breakthrough, with the announcement of a US-led ceasefire proposal. After Zelensky said last week that his country had accepted the 30-day proposal, the US made clear the onus was on Russia to agree, with Trump saying, “Russia holds all the cards.”
Efforts to bring Russia closer to an agreement intensified with Witkoff’s visit to Moscow on Thursday, where he met directly with Putin for several hours, CNN previously reported. Witkoff told CNN the meeting with Putin — his second known meeting with the Russian president this year — was “positive” and that the two sides had “narrowed the differences between them.”
Putin believes “philosophically in a truce,” Witkoff argued, after the Russian leader laid out numerous reservations he had.
Witkoff later flew to Florida to brief Trump on the discussions, and the president was so encouraged by Witkoff’s readout, the sources said, that he directed his team to begin preparations for a phone call with Putin.
Over the weekend, Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
“We are on the 10-yard line of peace,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, adding that the US has “never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment.”
A White House official reiterated that sentiment in a conversation with CNN, arguing that just a week ago they were “hundreds of miles apart, now we’re a couple hundred yards apart.” The official described Tuesday’s Trump-Putin phone call as the “natural next step” in negotiations.
Trump and his team have repeatedly argued the fighting needs to stop before they can proceed to the far more complicated issues that need to be resolved in a longer-term peace deal, like drawing territorial lines and negotiating security support for Ukraine.
But Putin has publicly shared skepticism over the US proposal, with one of his top negotiators, Yuriy Ushakov, dismissing the idea as “nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military.”
Asked by CNN on Friday about Putin’s reservations and whether he was playing for time, Rubio: “We’re not going to make our foreign policy decisions on the basis of what a leader says, simply says at a press conference.”
“This is going to play out the way things of this nature and caliber have traditionally and normally play out,” he added, “and that is with the leaders of the countries involved speaking, not in front of the cameras, not in front of the media, but in these negotiations that happen.”
Concessions in question
Ahead of the call, senior US officials had repeatedly argued that any permanent off-ramp from the Russia-Ukraine war would include all sides making concessions, but they had also been reticent to publicly discuss details.
After meeting with the Russians in Riyadh last month, Waltz said, “The practical reality is that there is going to be some discussion of territory.” Asked by CNN if it would be acceptable for Russia to retain territory it has annexed since 2022, Waltz said it was something “to be discussed.”
Rubio, ahead of a meeting with the Ukrainians last week, said they were in “listening mode” and “not going to be sitting in a room drawing lines on a map,” but wanted to “get a general sense of what concessions are in the realm of the possible.”
In an interview Sunday, Waltz was asked if “Russia could be given the Donbas in addition to hanging onto Crimea” – two Ukrainian regions it has occupied.
“Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea?” he told ABC News. “We can talk about what’s right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that’s what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/europe/analysis-putin-trump-phone-call-ukraine-intl-latam/index.html,"Putin just called Trump’s bluff on Ukraine, with the Russian art of the ‘no’ deal",2025-03-18 23:57:16,"A “no” is not a “yes” when it is a “maybe,” a “probably not,” or an “only if.”
This is the painfully predictable lesson the Trump administration’s first real foray into wartime diplomacy with the Kremlin has dealt. They’ve been hopelessly bluffed.
They asked for a 30-day, frontline-wide ceasefire, without conditions. On Tuesday, they got – after a theatrical week-long wait and hundreds more lives lost – a relatively small prisoner swap, hockey matches, more talks, and – per the Kremlin readout – a month-long mutual pause on attacks against “energy infrastructure.”
This last phrase is where an easily avoidable technical minefield begins. Per US President Donald Trump’s post and that of his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, the agreement concerned “energy and infrastructure.” These are two entirely different sets of ideas.
Russia says it will not attack Ukraine’s electricity grids and gas supplies, as it has mercilessly over the past years, to the extent that Ukraine’s winters have always been a dicey dance with icy families and reserve power sources. The White House, confusingly – in a disagreement, typo or translation nuance – has extended this truce to potentially every part of Ukraine that is considered infrastructure: bridges, perhaps key roads, or ports, or railways. It has created conditions that are almost impossible for Russia’s relentless pace of air assaults – which resumed, as they do every night, on Tuesday night – to adhere to.
Arguably, with summer close and the urgent need for Ukrainians to have heating reduced, Moscow ceasing energy infrastructure attacks is less of a concession. For Kyiv, however, the demand they stop hitting Russia’s energy infrastructure removes one of the most potent forms of attack Ukraine has. For months they have used long-range drones and missiles to strike Russia’s oil refineries and pipelines, causing serious damage to the Kremlin’s main fundraising tool: the export of its hydrocarbons, principally to China and India. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared amenable to the idea of a pause Tuesday, but said he still needed to know the “details.”
It is important to emphasize that Trump’s long-heralded call with Russian President Vladimir Putin yielded almost nothing bar the predictable fact that the Kremlin head feels he can outmaneuver his counterpart effortlessly. The swap of 175 prisoners and return of 23 seriously wounded Ukrainians is a minor arrangement, and smacks of something already in the works, given the frequency of similar past swaps and the fact it is due to happen as quickly as Wednesday.
Outside of this and the pause in attacks (whichever ones they agreed), Russia used this week-long delay and phone call to emphasize it wants all foreign aid and intelligence sharing halted as part of a deal and a series of “working groups” on Ukraine and Russia-US relations established. “Working groups” is a Russian diplomatic euphemism for fervid disinterest. Putin evidenced as much by apparently executing a pause in energy attacks immediately, but leaving all the stuff he didn’t want to do to another set of meetings at an undefined time. Putin seems set on returning to the idea that all aid to Ukraine be stopped, something which Trump has already done once, for about a week. It will return to their conversation again.
Some of these technical traps were laid by the basic nature of the initial Jeddah statement by the US and Ukraine. It was admirable but wildly simplistic to demand an immediate month-long stop to all hostilities in a three-year savage war. The proposal did not take into account how long such a step would take to enact with soldiers often cut off from their command, and made no mention of who would monitor adherence to it.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested “satellites” could provide all the surveillance needed. That is almost certainly true, but as an idea it assumes Moscow would be happy with the United States poring over its front-line positions in great detail and being the arbiter of who violated what. A cynic might say the Jeddah proposal was geared to pander to Trump’s simplistic, yet desirable, demand for immediate peace, but also allow Moscow’s customary and pedantic search for loopholes to get ensnared on its lack of technicalities. And Putin immediately sought to dangle the deal’s feet into these plentiful weeds.
Ultimately, the Kremlin did not seek to discuss “nuances” – the finer points, for example, of whether the OSCE or the UN would police the front line – but instead offered as few concessions as it could without providing Trump with a flat “no.”
But a flat “no” is what Trump has received. It is packaged as a “partial ceasefire,” but that is simply the first phase of Russia renewing its decade-long deceptive diplomacy. They have agreed to a pause in attacks that – largely from now on – will damage Moscow’s bank balance. Indeed, the initial and amateur confusion over what was agreed has opened a chasm in any future peace deal wide enough for Putin to drive another full-scale invasion through. Did both sides not set staffers aside after the call to prepare an identical readout of what was agreed?
The vaudeville theater of the past month should provide little comfort that the war is suddenly headed toward peace. Yes, the Trump administration has talked peace in a way that nobody has done so far in this war. But they have also managed to confirm, in short shrift, that Moscow looks for cracks of weakness and mercilessly drives a tank through them.
Trump felt he could either persuade, coax, or outsmart Putin. He has yet to do any of that. He has palpably lost in their first direct diplomatic face-off. For millions of Ukrainians his next choice defines their lives. Does he lose interest, apply pressure, or again provide concessions? It is a dizzying prospect.
His adversary is focused not on improved relations with Russia’s decades-long adversary, the United States, or with its current president, Donald Trump, but instead on victory in its most existential conflict since the Nazis.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/europe/ukraine-russia-kherson-front-lines/index.html,Kherson: On the streets of Ukraine’s front-line ghost city,2025-03-18 10:00:53,"Kherson is eerily quiet. The main square of this port city is almost entirely empty. There is little danger from traffic for the lone cyclist or the old woman who passes by, using her cane as she walks as quickly as she can to the grocery store.
This is a city on the front lines of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Russian troops are just across the Dnipro River, less than three miles from Ukrainian forces and the beleaguered population they’re charged with defending.
At the grocery store, large barriers protect the entrance, wood covering the glass doors. Residents — mostly older women and men — nip inside to see what is on the shelves, buying necessities for the day before heading back to shelter and home.
Kherson was the first major city to fall to the Russian forces that invaded Ukraine. When it was liberated eight months later, joyous crowds draped in blue and yellow Ukrainian flags took to the streets, hugging and kissing soldiers, and singing as car horns blared.
The flags are still out — a large one flying on top of a downtown bank building, smaller ones lining the streets and even painted on lampposts. But the noise and the joy are gone.
With Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin set to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine, the fate of this city and its people hangs in the balance. The illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 gave Putin a swath of land on the Black Sea south of Kherson, but the full-scale invasion that began in 2022 saw Moscow’s forces grab more and more territory.
Many of the buildings show the scars of the years of conflict — windows blown out and boarded up, chunks of rubble strewn around from shells hitting concrete.
The shells still fly overhead, producing deafening and destructive thuds when they land.
But it’s the whirr of drones that terrifies people here these days.
“It’s impossible to explain how scary it is,” says Olena Vassilievna Shigareva. “It flies, it buzzes, you don’t see it. And when you spot it, it stops and starts following you wherever you go.”
Shigareva says she and another woman were walking together when they were targeted by drones, in what some Kherson residents call a “safari” on them. Dozens of videos on the Telegram social media channel appear to show the phenomenon of armed camera drones chasing civilians and dropping explosives, set to music.
“They could see we were women, not soldiers,” Shigareva says. “We didn’t do anything to them. It’s just horror.”
Shigareva talks from her hospital bed, where she is being treated for a damaged knee and shrapnel in her leg.
The hospital is one of the few places we see where there is noise and movement, with medics hustling down the hallways to treat the war wounded — the majority, civilians hit by drone strikes.
Beds are crowded into available rooms, each with a patient. An elderly woman has her ankle pinned together; a teenager called Boris says he was on a bus when it was hit; and a man looks where his legs used to be — they were amputated high on both thighs.
Roman Mrochko, the mayor of Kherson, works in a basement, underground away from the danger of the drones. He says as many as 100 drones can be flown toward his city each day. “A large number are suppressed by our jammers but of course there are drones… that reach the target and hit our people,” he tells CNN. “We call it a hunt for civilians. The Russians send fresh drone units to Kherson, and they train by attacking civilians with drones,” he says.
Intentionally directing attacks against civilian infrastructure and civilians who are not directly taking part in hostilities is considered a war crime under international law.
Russia has been repeatedly accused of targeting Ukrainian civilians by Kyiv, its Western allies, the International Criminal Court and the United Nations. Throughout the war, Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations, despite substantial evidence to the contrary.
The exposed eastern outskirts of the city are where most of the drone attacks occur, its residents effectively pinned down. Early morning is the safest time to be on the streets, so it’s when volunteers are out delivering boxes of food aid from the back of a truck.
Women emerge nervously from homes, bundled up against the cold. Cardboard boxes are placed into grateful arms and then they return quickly inside. No one really wants to stop and talk.
And for good reason. After just a few minutes, the word comes in that drones have been launched from the Russian side of the river. In this ghost city, it is too dangerous to be outside. The aid workers secure the undelivered boxes and return to their depot. The other families on their route may go hungry this day or have to take their chances outside.","['Clarissa Ward', 'Brent Swails', 'Scott McWhinnie', 'Kosta Gak', 'Rachel Clarke']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/europe/ukraine-russia-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-negotiations-intl/index.html,Zaporizhzhia: Trump suggests Ukraine’s largest nuclear plant is on the line in talks with Putin. What’s next for the facility?,2025-03-18 14:17:08,"The fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been a concern since Moscow’s forces stormed the facility in March 2022.
The UN’s nuclear watchdog has repeatedly warned about the security dangers facing the plant – the largest nuclear power station in Europe – which sits on the front line of Russia’s invasion.
Now, the Zaporizhzhia plant is expected to be part of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, Trump administration officials said this week.
The White House press secretary on Monday falsely asserted that the occupied nuclear power plant is “on the border,” given that its location in the city of Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia, is almost 200 miles from Ukraine’s internationally recognized border. Its position on the Dnipro River is, however, right on the front line on the Russian-controlled side of Zaporizhzhia.
Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant supplied roughly 20% of Ukraine’s energy, with six reactors.
But the plant is now disconnected from the grid and has suffered some damage amid drone strikes and constant shelling. All six reactors are now in shutdown and there are concerns over the plant’s ongoing maintenance, as explosions continue to hit nearby, according to the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team on the ground.
Ukrainian officials have previously accused Russia of endangering the nuclear facility and surrounding population, while Moscow has accused Ukraine of instigating attacks on the plant. Ukraine has also previously raised concerns that Russia could try to connect the plant to its own power grid.
Speaking to journalists in Kyiv last Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the plant “is a problem for the Russians.”
“Its existence is impossible without Ukraine. We need money and specialists to restore it. And time too, it will take several years,” Zelensky said. “This is also a problem for us because it is our plant. Lost money, lost opportunities.”
“I am sure that they (Russia) will make political, public statements that the station will soon be operational and will supply electricity to the territories controlled by the Russians. It will not happen quickly,” Zelensky added. “And the (UN nuclear watchdog) IAEA will be under constant political pressure because the IAEA cannot allow them to do this.”
Trump said on Sunday that negotiators had already pinpointed certain topics up for discussion in his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including “dividing up certain assets” and saying: “We will be talking about land, we’ll be talking about power plants.”
Asked about Trump’s comment on power plants, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday: “There’s a power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine that was up for discussion with the Ukrainians, and he will address it in his call with Putin,” specifying that she was talking about the nuclear plant.
“I won’t get ahead of those negotiations, but I can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace, and we’ve never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment, and the president, as you know, is determined to get one done,” Leavitt also said.
Zaporizhzhia is one of the four regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022. The Kremlin annexed the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia following so-called referendums in the regions that were dismissed as “shams” by Ukraine and Western nations. Russia had previously annexed Crimea in 2014.
Putin has continued to make maximalist demands to control all of those regions, even though Ukraine still holds significant amounts of territory in Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.
The Kremlin said last month that the four occupied and annexed regions are “an integral part of Russia” and “non-negotiable.”

Trump’s comments come after he announced last week that Ukraine had accepted a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire, putting the ball in Russia’s court as to whether it would accept his proposal to swiftly end the war.
“We’re doing pretty well, I think, with Russia. We’ll see if we have something to announce maybe by Tuesday, I’ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday,” he told reporters on board Air Force One during a flight back to the White House after his weekend at Mar-a-Lago.
“A lot of work’s been done over the weekend, we want to see if we can bring that war to an end,” he said. “Maybe we can, maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance.”
Trump said negotiators had already pinpointed certain topics up for discussion.
“We’ll be talking about land. A lot of land is a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We’ll be talking about land, we’ll be talking about power plants, that’s a big question,” he added.
“But I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much, by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We’re already talking about that – dividing up certain assets.”
The Kremlin spokesperson confirmed that the two leaders would speak Tuesday but did not disclose any further details.
Putin’s response so far to the Trump-backed ceasefire proposal has been ambiguous. He said that Moscow agreed with the proposal in theory. But he also set out tough conditions and demanded concessions from Kyiv, and repeated his claim that the current Ukrainian government was part of the “root cause” of the war.
Meetings between American negotiators with representatives from Ukraine and Russia will continue this week. The Kremlin also said last week that US negotiators would travel to Russia for further talks, though it did not share details on the participants.
Russia first started seizing parts of Ukraine in 2014 before launching its full invasion in 2022, triggering the largest land conflict in Europe since World War Two. Since the 2022 invasion, Ukraine has lost control of about 11% of its land, according to CNN analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor.
Land concessions are among the most sensitive issues left to hammer out. American officials have said Ukraine will likely need to cede territory for the war to end, and Putin has made it a condition of entering into a ceasefire.
But conceding territory has long been a nonstarter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and some European leaders have voiced concern about appearing to reward Putin for launching his invasion. Russia has also made clear it has no desire to give up the swathes of Ukrainian territory it has occupied.
Trump’s willingness to grant Moscow concessions even before talks began and his embrace of Putin have also rattled NATO allies in Europe who are now openly questioning whether decades of US security guarantees towards the continent can be relied upon.
Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN on Sunday that the ongoing talks over Ukraine were productive, but didn’t say how the matter of territorial concessions would be resolved.
Putin “accepts the philosophy of President Trump” in wanting to see the war come to an end, Witkoff said. He described his meeting last week with Putin as a “solution-based discussion,” and voiced confidence that a pause in fighting could arrive within weeks.
Putin also said Friday that his country is working at restoring relations with the US, after they were “practically reduced to zero, destroyed by the previous American administration.”
“Overall, the situation is starting to move,” he said, referring to relations with the Trump administration. “Let’s see what comes out of this.”",['Jessie Yeung'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/europe/ukrainians-search-missing-captured-intl-cmd/index.html,How Ukrainians are searching for missing persons using AI and an army of families,2025-03-16 05:00:52,"“Hi, Mom. All good. I will be offline, probably for a long time, maybe a week or month. Don’t worry.”
That was the last message Nazar Ocheretnyi sent his mother, on March 30, 2022. Nearly three years later, he still hasn’t been in touch. The Ukrainian combat medic disappeared aged 33 in Mariupol, the eastern Ukrainian city that was then under siege in one of the bloodiest chapters in the Russian war against Ukraine.
On April 12, 2022, Ocheretnyi’s mother, Valentyna Ocheretnaya, was officially informed that her son was missing in action, “possibly captured.” Despite his 61-year-old mother’s tireless search, as of March 2025 he remains neither confirmed dead nor known to be alive.
Ocheretnyi is one of the almost 60,000 military personnel and civilians recognized as missing under special circumstances in the government’s Unified Register. However, the real number could be much higher.
“If the person is in the register - there are two main versions - the person either is in Russian captivity, or the person is dead,” said Artur Dobroserdov, Commissioner for Persons Missing under Special Circumstances.
But the longer the war continues, the more difficult it is for the Ukrainian government to find those who were captured or killed.
The way the war is fought has also changed since 2022. Both armies now use drones extensively, so returning bodies from the front lines is increasingly difficult – which is why Russia and Ukraine regularly exchange bodies. Ukraine has managed to bring home more than 7,000 bodies since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
“All military units know that they have to take the bodies of both our defenders and the enemy. If taken, the enemy’s body is an asset for the ‘exchange fund’ to be used in (a) repatriation procedure,” said Dobroserdov.
Mandatory DNA testing
During the last such repatriation, on February 14, Ukraine brought home the bodies of 757 fallen soldiers. But for their relatives, that still wasn’t the moment when they could finally bury their beloved according to Ukrainian traditions.
“I will tell you the bitter truth. You still have to be lucky to find your loved one and bury them,” says a comment on social media in a discussion about soldiers who are missing in action.
Identifying missing persons among repatriated remains is a long and complex process. Often, what’s returned is just remnants of bodies, Dobroserdov said - mutilated, fragmented, rotted or burnt.
“The most difficult for an expert is when one package arrives and it contains a large number of body fragments. When you open it, you don’t understand whether it belongs to one person or 10 to 20,” said Ruslan Abbasov, deputy director of the State Scientific Research Forensic Center.
Experts say that sometimes, but not often, bodies are brought back with indications of their identity. This information needs to be cross-checked, however. There have been cases where a name was assigned to a body but, after DNA testing, it turned out to be that of a completely different person.
Even if relatives recognize a fallen soldier, DNA testing is still mandatory for final identification. This is particularly essential in repatriation exchanges, said Dobroserdov, where the returned remains can belong to multiple people.
“We take a DNA sample from each body part and create a DNA profile. We release the body only after we have examined everyone from this repatriation. Because you can’t make an identification order, bury a person, and then find some more remains after a while,” explained Dobroserdov, adding that there were cases in which the remains of one body were delivered during different repatriations at different times.
In cases where the missing person has no relatives, experts also analyze the belongings they left behind – specifically items that have been in direct contact with their skin – in order to search for a DNA match.
Facial reconstruction techniques
To speed up the search, the Ukrainian authorities are turning to advanced technologies. On February 20, the National Police of Ukraine posted computer-generated images on social media of five unidentified men who were killed in action.
“If you recognize any of your relatives or friends who went missing because of the war or know people who are looking for them, please contact us,” said the message.
It was the first time that Ukrainians had made use of 3D-reconstruction techniques for this purpose.
“We are testing the technology for restoring facial features of unidentified bodies based on the shape of the skull and available genomic information,” Khrystyna Podyriako, head of the National Police’s war crimes investigation department, told CNN.
This allows the restoration of distinguishing features such as hair and skin color, face shape, and approximate age.
Ukrainians also use facial recognition software provided by Western partners and conduct searches in databases, social media, and online. One tool employed is the Clearview AI application, which allows users to recognize faces from photos posted on social networks and has enabled researchers to identify missing soldiers who are in captivity.
According to Dobroserdov, Russia does not always keep accurate lists of prisoners of war, which means that the Ukrainians must find and confirm the identities of many of those held captive.
CNN was granted rare access to one of the facial identification facilities in Kyiv, where a team of four people hunts for images of any captured soldier who appears on Russian Telegram channels or media, and tries to identify them. Such work requires special attention to detail; dozens of soldiers’ photos are on computer screens. If the team finds a match, it will notify the soldier’s family that their loved one is likely in captivity.
‘Bring my son back to me’
In support of the government efforts, Ukrainians unite into so-called “armies of families,” searching across Russian TV channels, social media and news videos for signs of the missing.
Families often also conduct their own investigations. Ocheretnaya obtained information from at least three different people that her son, the combat medic, had been seen in captivity in Russia.
“Everything matches what the eyewitnesses are saying. They recognized him from his photo, his callsign, told me where and what kind of tattoo he had. One guy said Nazar for two weeks gave him bandages on his arm after the Russians burned a tattoo of a Ukrainian emblem on his body,” Ocheretnaya said.
She learned of three locations where Ocheretnyi had likely been seen: in Russia’s Volgograd and Sakha regions, and in Olenivka prison in Russian-occupied Donetsk region. She gave all the information she’d gathered to Ukrainian authorities and the International Committee of the Red Cross. But her son is not on any official Russian list.
Ocheretnaya also provided her DNA, but the database has found no match. “It means that he is alive; I know it. Maybe he’s in a prison where they haven’t released the prisoners yet, so his name’s nowhere to be found,” she said.
Over the past three years, Ocheretnaya has attended many meetings held by relatives of those missing in action and joined almost every Telegram group where they talk. She’s contacted everyone from Ocheretnyi’s brigade, and is still searching for him everywhere.
“I have an old video with him in which he is driving, joking, and laughing with other guys. I watch this video several times per day. I know every second, every turn of the eye, every wave of the hand,” said Ocheretnaya.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly said that Ukraine is ready for an “all-for-all” exchange. Russia releasing all the Ukrainian captives it holds would be a good step toward peace.
That is exactly what Ocheretnaya, like thousands of other Ukrainian families, is waiting for.
“I’m really asking God to bring my son back to me. I don’t need anything else. Just to bring him back,” she said.",['Daria Tarasova-Markina'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/starmer-not-good-enough-putin-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Putin’s response to Ukraine ceasefire not good enough, UK PM says, as Kyiv allies seek to pressure Russia",2025-03-15 09:49:50,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s response to a US-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine is “not good enough,” Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, after hosting a virtual summit aimed at drumming up support for Kyiv and piling pressure on Russia.
After hosting a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – a group of Western nations that have pledged to help defend Ukraine against Russia – Starmer said leaders had agreed that “the ‘yes but’ from Russia is not good enough” and that Russia would have to come to the negotiating table sooner or later.
“We agreed collective pressure will be put on Russia from all of us who were in the meeting this morning,” he added.
Saturday’s meeting involved some 25 countries, including European nations, the EU Commission, NATO, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as well as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.
After Kyiv this week accepted the terms of a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine – endorsed by US President Donald Trump – Moscow’s response was ambiguous, with Putin saying that “we agree with the proposal” but also that the deal “wasn’t complete.”
The meeting also comes at a critical time in the three-year war, with Russia advancing in its Kursk border region where it is attempting to reverse Ukraine’s gains.
While he offered few new details, Starmer announced that the militaries of Ukraine’s allies will meet in the United Kingdom on Thursday, to “put strong and robust plans in place” to keep the peace in the event a ceasefire is struck in Ukraine.
“We will now move into an operational phase,” Starmer said. “Our militaries will meet on Thursday this week here in the United Kingdom to put strong and robust plans in place to swing behind a peace deal and guarantee Ukraine’s future security.”
During Saturday’s talks, Starmer said that Ukraine’s allies agreed to “keep the military aid flowing to Ukraine, and keep tightening restrictions on Russia’s economy, to weaken Putin’s war machine and bring him to the table.”
Starmer said that Putin was delaying the US-backed ceasefire proposal that Ukraine agreed to this week, and that Ukraine “is the party of peace.”
US President Donald Trump “has offered Putin the way forward to a lasting peace – now we must make this a reality,” Starmer said.
Responding to a question from a journalist about US support, Starmer stressed that the “position on the US hasn’t changed,” and that achieving peace in Ukraine “needs to be done in conjunction with the United States.”
It comes after Starmer said in opening remarks to the “coalition of the willing” that “if Putin is serious about peace, it’s very simple: He has to stop his barbaric attacks on Ukraine and agree to a ceasefire.” He continued, “The world is watching. My feeling is that sooner or later he’s going to have to come to the table and engage in serious discussion.”
The “coalition of the willing,” a group of who have pledged to help defend Ukraine from Russian aggression in the face of dwindling and uncertain support from Washington, last met in London two weeks ago before reconvening Saturday for the virtual meeting.
Although Europe has shown considerable unity amid the blows the Trump administration has dealt to the transatlantic alliance, significant divisions remain over whether individual European countries are willing to deploy troops to Ukraine to keep the peace.
A statement from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s office said that Meloni, who joined Saturday’s virtual summit, does not envisage Italy’s participation in a possible military presence in Ukraine.
Trump said Friday that he got “pretty good news” on a potential ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, without elaborating, and that his administration had “very good calls” with both countries earlier in the day.
In a separate post on Truth Social, Trump said “there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.”
Putin met with US special envoy Steve Witkoff on Thursday in Moscow – a visit that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said gave “reason to be cautiously optimistic.”
With Kyiv losing its grip on the western Russian region of Kursk, its sole territorial bargaining chip, many believe that Putin may be delaying talks on the ceasefire proposal until the region is firmly back under Russian control.
Russian forces have retaken two more settlements in Kursk – Zaoleshenka and Rubanshchina – its defense ministry claimed on Saturday. It comes days after Russia recaptured the key town of Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine had occupied in the region.
Zelensky said Saturday his troops were holding back Russian and North Korean forces in Kursk and denied Russian claims that Ukraine’s army was surrounded.
Meanwhile the aerial assaults continued, with hundred of drones crossing the border.
Russia fired 178 drones and two ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, killing at least two people and injuring 44, according to Ukrainian officials. The two were killed in Kherson region, the head of its military administration said, after Russia targeted critical infrastructure and residential buildings, damaging seven high-rise buildings and 27 houses.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses had shot down 126 Ukrainian drones overnight, without saying how many drones bypassed its defenses.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/europe/romania-election-trump-us-right-georgescu-tate-intl/index.html,How America’s online right became obsessed with a low-profile European country,2025-03-15 10:05:45,"Romania, a country on Europe’s eastern fringe, is perhaps a surprising focus of attention for a new US administration whose foreign policy priorities include ending the war in Ukraine, reshaping the Middle East and expanding American territory.
Accustomed to flying under the radar, many in the country have been stunned by the Trump administration’s interest in its politics, which rarely garners international attention.
“It’s been unprecedented,” said Oana Popescu-Zamfir, director of the GlobalFocus Center, a think-tank in the capital, Bucharest. She said she cannot recall a time in Romania’s post-Soviet history that its affairs have been so closely scrutinized from afar.
The attention has centered on Calin Georgescu, a Kremlin-friendly ultranationalist candidate in Romania’s abruptly aborted presidential election last year, and Andrew Tate, a “manosphere” celebrity charged with rape and human trafficking by Romanian authorities, allegations that he denies.
The two men have little in common, but their claims to have both been subjected to a “witch hunt” by corrupt liberal institutions – à la President Donald Trump – have helped turn them into cause célèbres in conservative American circles and made an enemy of the Romanian state.
In Georgescu, the online right sees a politician with unorthodox views being denied an election victory on flimsy claims of “foreign interference.” In Tate, it sees an influential man facing trumped-up charges to cut him down. And in Romania, it sees the grossest case of what JD Vance called Europe’s “threat from within.”
The two men have amplified the US vice president’s claim. Since Romania lifted travel restrictions on Tate – reportedly following US pressure – the self-proclaimed misogynist influencer has stressed that the charges against him were fake, comparing his legal troubles to those of Trump.
“Remember what they did to Trump. Remember his accusations. Remember calling him a convicted felon… he was innocent,” Tate said in a video recorded from a sunlounge in Florida. “The greatest men in history have suffered this law fare [sic] and slander,” he said in a post, listing Trump alongside Nelson Mandela and Malcolm X.
Georgescu, who was virtually unknown before Romania’s election, has also compared claims made about his election campaign to those about Trump.
The 62-year-old former soil scientist – who opposes sending aid to Ukraine, calls Russian President Vladimir Putin a “patriot” and has voiced sympathy with Romania’s fascist leadership during World War II – unexpectedly won the first-round vote in November. But the constitutional court annulled the election after declassified intelligence reports uncovered possible Russian interference in Georgescu’s TikTok-fueled campaign, which Moscow denied.
After prosecutors charged him with establishing a fascist group and other crimes, which he denies, the electoral bureau banned Georgescu from standing in May’s re-run, outraging American conservatives and causing violent protests in Bucharest.
“It has nothing to do with [Russia],” Georgescu told Fox News last week. “It’s just a copy-paste of the accusations made against Donald Trump.”
While Tate has long championed Trump, Georgescu is a newer convert. As recently as last summer, Georgescu publicly disparaged the US president and spread conspiracy theories about Vance.
But Georgescu soon sensed an opportunity to “ride the Trump wave,” said Corneliu Bjola, professor of digital diplomacy at the University of Oxford.
“[Georgescu] drew inspiration from a style of political discourse that seems to operate without rules – marked by conspiratorial thinking, disinformation and personal attacks against opponents,” Bjola told CNN.
“Trump’s apparent legal immunity, despite his association with the January 6 insurrection and numerous political and personal scandals, further inspires [him and] reinforces a ‘victimhood narrative,’” he added.
‘Red meat to the base’
But while courting the Trump administration has seemed to benefit both men, it is less clear why some of Trump’s deputies have tried to propel Georgescu to power and, reportedly, used diplomatic capital to free Tate and his brother, Tristan.
Last month, the Financial Times reported, citing sources, that Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell had pressed Romania’s foreign minister to ease restrictions on the Tate brothers during talks at the Munich Security Conference. Romania’s foreign ministry told CNN there was “no pressure, no solicitations” in the talks. Grenell has also denied pressuring Romanian officials.
Less than two weeks after the conference, Romanian authorities lifted a travel ban on the Tates. The pair had been charged with forming a criminal gang and human trafficking, and Andrew has been charged with rape. In another probe, both are under investigation for money laundering. They have denied wrongdoing.
“Why would you release these people? They are accused of horrible things,” Bjola asked, saying it was a “bad look” for both countries. “The US used to defend Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Lech Walesa, these types of people – and all of a sudden it’s defending alleged sexual predators.”
When asked about the Tates’ return to the US, Trump said he knew “nothing” about it.
Others have said they were not surprised by the Trump administration’s reported efforts to free the Tates.
“Trump and MAGA are a very transactional group. If you do something to help them, they’ll do something to help you,” said Jamie Tahsin, a documentary maker who has reported on Tate for years.
“It’s red meat to the base,” Tahsin told CNN. “They can say, ‘Look, here’s another example of where the mainstream media, the legal system and governments have weaponized the law against an individual because they don’t like the things he says – just like what happened with Trump.”
The Tates are expected to return to Romania for their next court appearance later this month, but some doubt whether they will do so voluntarily, or whether Washington will force them to.
“There’s this general understanding in America right now that if you’re on Trump’s side… you will be OK, regardless of what you’ve done,” Tahsin said.
Standoff with Brussels
Georgescu has also proved valuable to the Trump administration, analysts say. In his blistering Munich speech, Vance singled out Romania as an instance of democratic backsliding in Europe.
“If your democracy can be destroyed by a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,” Vance said, pillorying Romania’s decision to annul its election.
Marietje Schaake, a fellow at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center, told CNN the American right had turned Georgescu into a “symbol of what’s wrong with European democracy” that “fits into their broader agenda of weakening the European Union.”
Having shown little interest in the bloc in his first term, Trump has claimed the EU was created solely to “screw the US” and threatened the bloc with huge tariffs.
The Euroskeptic Georgescu has been lionized by American conservatives who share Trump’s ire towards Brussels. While interviewing Georgescu on a podcast, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones said the election annulment was “one of the most naked coups I’ve seen in the last 100 years – and I study history.”
Mario Nawfal, another “manosphere” influencer who interviewed Georgescu, said the authorities’ attempts to stop him running was “the EXACT playbook they tried against Trump.”
As well as undermining trust in elections, Popescu-Zamfir said Georgescu helps the Trump administration because “the more the world looks like it’s ideologically aligned with their beliefs and practices, the more (Trump) gets reconfirmed back home.”
Calm after the storm?
The intense online scrutiny and chaos after postponing its election has left Romania reeling. Many are outraged that Georgescu cannot run in May, while others are dismayed that the Tates might not face justice.
The experience of being caught in the crosshairs of the online US right has led to a strange irony, Popescu-Zamfir said.
Since the collapse of Communism in 1989, Romania has often needed steering from Washington to stay its Euro-Atlantic course. “But now, this is the first time in 35 years, since the regime change, that the Romanian state… decided to keep to the pro-European, pro-democratic path, not because of external pressure, but despite it,” she said.
While the country’s institutions may have weathered the storm for now, Bjola, the Oxford professor, said Romanian politicians have yet to explain satisfactorily why Georgescu has been banned from running, which could provide fertile ground for conspiracies.
“[Their silence] has tremendous cost in a digital age, because if you don’t speak about what happened, this vacuum is going to be filled by Russian and domestic actors who have a different agenda,” he said.",['Christian Edwards'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/europe/putin-kursk-ukrainian-troops-zelensky-intl/index.html,"Putin calls on Ukrainian troops in Kursk to surrender, as Zelensky asks US to put pressure on Russia",2025-03-14 23:05:10,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has called on Ukrainian troops in the Russian region of Kursk to surrender, as diplomatic back-and-forth continues over a potential US-brokered ceasefire with Kyiv.
At a meeting with members of Russia’s security council on Friday, Putin accused Ukrainian troops in the region of committing crimes against civilians, but acknowledged US President Donald Trump’s wish to spare the soldiers’ lives as Russian forces retake the area and claimed surrendering soldiers’ lives would be guaranteed.
He also said that his country is working at restoring relations with the US, after they were “practically reduced to zero, destroyed by the previous American administration.”
“Overall, the situation is starting to move,” he said on relations with the Trump administration. “Let’s see what comes out of this.”
With Kyiv losing its grip on Kursk, its sole territorial bargaining chip, many believe that Putin may be delaying talks on a US-Ukraine ceasefire proposal until the region is back under Russian control. Earlier this week, Ukrainian officials accepted a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire covering the entire front line after holding talks with US counterparts in Saudi Arabia.
Putin’s remarks came after he met with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on Thursday in Moscow – a visit that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said gave “reason to be cautiously optimistic.” Trump earlier in the day had struck a similar note, calling the discussions “good and productive” in a post on Truth Social, adding that “there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.”
Trump also said that he has “strongly requested” for Putin to spare the lives of Ukrainian troops in Kursk.
“We understand President Trump’s call to be guided by humanitarian considerations with regard to these servicemen,” Putin said on Friday. “In this regard, I would like to emphasize that if they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and decent treatment in accordance with international law and the laws of the Russian Federation.”
Ukraine’s military would first have to order troops in Kursk to surrender, however, he added.
In February, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said it was alarmed at reports that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered to Russia since the end of August 2024 had been “shot dead on the spot.”
“All allegations of execution of captured Ukrainian military personnel and public statements calling for, or condoning, such actions must be investigated,” Danielle Bell, head of the mission, said at the time.
‘Every day of war means losing lives’
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile on Friday expressed skepticism about Putin’s motives and urged the US to take “strong steps” to pressure Russia into ending its war against Kyiv.
In a series of posts on X, the Ukrainian leader said his country wants peace, writing that “from the very first minutes of this war, we have wanted only one thing – for Russia to leave our people in peace and for Russian occupiers to get off our land.”
“Every day of war means losing the lives of our people – the most valuable thing we have,” he said.
Zelensky also accused Putin of attempting to sabotage peace negotiations and lying about the “real situation” on the battlefield. The Russian leader on Thursday had suggested a number of conditions for truce, including that any deal address what the Kremlin sees as “root causes” of the conflict.
Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion in 2022. At the time, Putin demanded that Ukraine never be allowed into NATO, and that the bloc roll back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – which the US and its allies dismissed as non-starters, condemning the invasion as a blatant land grab.
“Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing,” Zelensky said. “That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire.”
Zelensky said that he “strongly urges” countries that can influence Russia, especially the US, to take steps to help end the war.
“Pressure must be applied to the one who does not want to stop the war. Pressure must be put on Russia. Only decisive actions can end this war, which has already lasted for years,” he said.
The Ukrainian leader is expected to take part in a virtual meeting with European and NATO leaders on support for Ukraine on Saturday, hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.","['Catherine Nicholls', 'Mariya Knight']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/politics/fact-check-trump-immigration-biden-ukraine-doj/index.html,"Fact check: Trump’s false claims on immigration, Biden, Ukraine in DOJ remarks",2025-03-14 21:58:11,"President Donald Trump made multiple false claims in a Friday speech at the Department of Justice in which he discussed the legal system and crime but also a wide range of other topics, including immigration, the war in Ukraine and former President Joe Biden.
Trump also made numerous allegations for which he provided no evidence, alleging unspecified “egregious crimes” in the government during the Biden administration, corruption among unspecified judges, illegality by media outlets that he claimed cover him too negatively and “crooked” behavior by law firms connected to cases involving Trump.
Here is a fact check of some of his assertions.
Trump’s prosecutions and Biden: Trump repeated his regular unsubstantiated claim that former President Joe Biden used his office to wield the legal system against Trump.
“Etched onto the walls of this building are the words English philosopher John Locke said: ‘Where law ends, tyranny begins.’ And I see that, and I saw it over the last four years when somebody was allowed to attack, viciously, with this department and the FBI, his political opponent. How did that work out? It didn’t work out too well, but it wasn’t pleasant. I was attacked by a political opponent,” Trump said.
There has never been any evidence that Biden personally used the Department of Justice or FBI to attack Trump.
Trump’s two federal prosecutions, one over Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and one over his retention of classified documents after his first presidency, were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed in November 2022 by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, but that is not proof that Biden was involved in the prosecution effort, much less that Biden personally attacked Trump using the department; Garlandsaid in 2023 that he would resign if Biden ever asked him to act against Trump, and added that he was sure that would never happen.
Trump’s two other prosecutions were brought by local district attorneys, one in Manhattan, New York, and one in Fulton County, Georgia. Both are Democrats, but there is, again, no evidence that Biden or his White House directed their decisions. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records in the Manhattan case; the Georgia case was put on hold in June 2024 while an appeals court considered whether the district attorney, Fani Willis, should be disqualified from the case.
The two federal cases were dropped by Smith because of Trump’s 2024 election victory. The documents case had previously been dismissed by a Trump-appointed federal judge, but Smith had appealed her ruling that his appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional.
Biden documents investigation: Trump falsely claimed in his remarks that former President Joe Biden was “essentially found guilty, but they said he was incompetent and therefore let’s not find him guilty, I guess.” He added, “Nobody knows what the ruling was.” He continued, “I think I would have rather been found guilty than what they found with him. They said he didn’t know what the hell he was doing and therefore … let him go.”
Biden was not found guilty, “essentially” or not, and there was no judicial “ruling” at all; Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel who was appointed to look into Biden’s handling of classified documents, Robert Hur, wrote in his public report that “the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” adding that “several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.”
Trump appeared to be referring Friday to the fact that Hur wrote in the report, “We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” But Hur did not say he would have brought charges against Biden if not for this. Hur wrote at length about various facts of the case and possible Biden defenses that meant that he thought would make it too difficult for the government to win a unanimous guilty verdict.
Immigration under Trump: Trump repeated two false claims about immigration statistics during his presidencies.
First, he said, “In our first full month in office, we achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings ever recorded.” He could have accurately said the number of migrant apprehensions by the Border Patrol in February 2025 – 8,347 – was the lowest in many decades, but it’s not the lowest number on record. Official federal statistics show there were fewer Border Patrol encounters with migrants at the southwest border in some of the months of the early 1960s and in years prior.
Second, he said that “by the time I got out” of office the first time, “we had the lowest numbers ever. My favorite chart of all time was brought down that day and, on that chart, it said we had the lowest numbers ever.” But the chart doesn’t actually show that illegal immigration was at its lowest level at the time Trump left office, though text beside a red arrow on the chart claims that’s what it shows. In fact, the arrow actually points to April 2020, when Trump still had more than eight months left in his first term and when global migration had slowed to a trickle because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
After hitting a roughly three-year low (not an all-time low) in April 2020, migration numbers at the southern border increased each month through the end of Trump’s first term.
US and European aid to Ukraine: Trump repeated his debunked claim that the US has spent “maybe $350 billion” aiding Ukraine compared to $100 billion from Europe.
Neither figure is correct. The $350 billion figure Trump has repeatedly cited is particularly inaccurate.
According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, Europe – the European Union plus individual European countries – had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December 2024 (about $269 billion at current exchange rates) than the US committed (about $129 billion). Europe had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $144 billion) than the US allocated (about $124 billion).
It’s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump’s “$350 billion” figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the Ukraine response says on its website that the US had appropriated about $183 billion for the Ukraine response through December 2024, including about $83 billion actually disbursed – and that includes funding spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine.
US elections: Trump, vowing to restore “fairness” in the country, baselessly impugned the integrity of US elections, saying, “The elections, which were totally rigged, are a big factor.” He didn’t invoke the 2020 election in particular, as he usually does, but there is nonetheless no basis for a broader claim that recent “elections” in this country, plural, have been “totally rigged.”",['Daniel Dale'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/europe/russia-us-ceasefire-talks-intl/index.html,Russia-Ukraine ceasefire: Putin lays out sweeping questions and tough demands about US proposal,2025-03-13 00:00:00,"Russian President Vladimir Putin questioned the United States-brokered proposal for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war on Thursday, setting forth tough conditions and demanding concessions from Kyiv despite saying he supported a truce in theory.
“We agree with the proposal to cease hostilities but we have to bear in mind that this ceasefire must be aimed at a long-lasting peace and it must look at the root causes of the crisis,” Putin said at a news conference – repeating the Kremlin’s previous claims that the current Ukrainian government is part of the underlying problem.
Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion in 2022. At the time, Putin demanded that Ukraine never be allowed into NATO, and that the bloc roll back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – which the US and its allies dismissed as non-starters, condemning the invasion as a blatant land grab.
Putin also suggested that Ukraine halt mobilization and any training of its troops, and that other nations stop supplying weapons to Kyiv during the ceasefire – at a time when “Russian troops are advancing on almost all areas of combat contact.”
Though the US idea is “great and correct,” many things still need to be discussed, he said, adding that “maybe” he would call US President Donald Trump.
The news conference came as American special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow to brief Kremlin officials on the peace plan. Ukrainian officials had accepted the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire covering the entire front line after holding talks with US counterparts in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.
Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow late Thursday night, two Trump administration officials told CNN. The meeting lasted several hours and stretched into early Friday morning, the officials said. Witkoff left Russia shortly after the meeting wrapped.
The officials provided no detail on the substance of the meeting. However, Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that “We do have some cautious optimism.” The interview took place after the meeting between Witkoff and Putin ended.
Putin sent “additional signals” to Trump through Witkoff, the Kremlin said on Friday. “Additional information was provided to the Russian side. Putin also passed information and additional signals to President Trump through Witkoff,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a conference call.
Meanwhile, Putin’s Thursday comments quickly drew condemnation from Kyiv, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accusing the Russian leader of dragging out the negotiations rather than rejecting the deal completely.
“Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians,” he said, criticizing Putin’s response as “very manipulative.”
Later on Thursday, Trump called Putin’s response “promising” but not complete.
“I’d love to meet with them or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast. You know, every day, people are being killed,” he said in the Oval Office, adding that it will be a “very disappointing moment for the world” if Russia does not agree to the ceasefire.
He also said the US has been discussing with Ukraine what land would be kept and lost in any final deal. “So, a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed,” he said.
Russian officials take harder line
Putin raised a host of questions echoed by other Russian officials, some of whom took a stronger stance against the proposed ceasefire.
The concerns Putin raised included what would happen in Russia’s western Kursk region, where Ukraine occupies some territory; how the ceasefire would be verified; and how Kyiv would use the 30-day truce.
“What will we do with this area in the Kursk region – if we stop military actions for 30 days, does this mean that everyone who is there will leave without a fight? Should we release them from there after they have committed a lot of crimes against civilians?” Putin said, though he’d also said earlier that Kursk was back under Russian control and Ukrainian troops were “completely isolated.”
Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin aide Yuriy Ushakov said Moscow doesn’t want a temporary ceasefire, claiming it would give a break to the Ukrainian army. Ushakov said he explained Russia’s stance to US National Security Adviser Michael Waltz in a Wednesday phone call.
“(I) outlined our position that this is nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military and nothing more,” Ushakov said in an interview with Russian state media, pouring cold water on the proposal before Thursday’s talks began.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quick to clarify that Ushakov’s remarks should not be seen as a Russian rejection of the US proposal, and that Moscow was awaiting further information before making a decision.
Ushakov also claimed that “the Americans and we think that there can be no talk about NATO in the context of the Ukrainian settlement and in the context of Ukraine’s future.”
Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova went further, saying on Thursday there must not be “any” foreign military presence in Ukraine.
“For us, it is absolutely unacceptable to deploy units of the armed forces of other states in Ukraine under any flag, whether it be a foreign contingent, military bases, or some peacekeeping operations,” Zakharova said, adding that Russia would respond with “with all available means.”
When US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was asked Wednesday about the possibility of European troops acting as peacekeepers, the top US diplomat responded: “There’s different ways to construct a deterrent on the ground.”
Meanwhile, the Russian military said Thursday it had recaptured Sudzha, the largest town that Ukraine once occupied in Kursk, threatening Kyiv’s sole territorial bargaining chip amid pressure to negotiate an end to the war, in what would represent a symbolic victory for the Kremlin.

It’s a promise fraught with risk for Ukraine. The last time it signed a peace accord with Russia, 10 years ago this February, it brought only sporadic violence, mounting distrust, and eventually full-scale war.
“I told President Trump about this,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview last month with CNN affiliate CNN Turk. “If you can get Putin to end the war, that’s great. But know that he can cheat. He deceived me like that. After the Minsk ceasefire.”
The Minsk accords – the first signed in September 2014 and, when that broke down, a second known as Minsk II just five months later – were designed to end a bloody conflict between Kyiv’s forces and Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk, in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s then-leader Petro Poroshenko were signatories, along with the OSCE.
The accords were never fully implemented and violence flared up periodically in the seven years that followed.
Now, as Ukraine and its allies attempt to forge another path to peace, experts warn the failures of Minsk serve as a cautionary tale for today’s peacemakers, and that the risks of history repeating are clear. Here’s what we’ve learned:
1. Strengthening Ukraine militarily is critical
In 2015, Western military aid to Ukraine was minimal, and mostly limited to non-lethal supplies, though the Obama administration did supply defensive military equipment. “The crisis cannot be resolved by military means,” said then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a speech at the 2015 Munich Security Conference, which coincided with the talks on Minsk II. Her assessment of those diplomatic efforts was blunt: “It’s unclear whether they’ll succeed.”
It didn’t help that both Minsk accords were signed right after, or during, major military defeats for Ukraine.
The first agreement followed what’s believed to be the deadliest episode of the conflict in the Donbas, at Ilovaisk. In late August 2014, hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed as they tried to flee the town to avoid encirclement.
Six months later, Minsk II was signed while fierce fighting raged for another Donetsk town, Debaltseve. That battle continued for several days beyond the initial ceasefire deadline.
Marie Dumoulin, a diplomat at the French Embassy in Berlin at the time, says those defeats put both Ukraine and its allies firmly on the back foot in the talks.
“Basically the main goal, both for France and Germany, but also for the Ukrainians, was to end the fighting,” she told CNN. But, she added, “Russia through its proxies, but also directly, was in a much stronger position on the battlefield, and so could increase the intensity of fighting to put additional pressure on the negotiations.”
From a military perspective, Ukraine’s Western-backed, almost million-strong army of today is almost unrecognizable from the underfunded and under-equipped force that took on the Russian-backed separatists in 2014.
And yet, as Ukraine “accepts” a temporary ceasefire proposal, it faces a double challenge.
Firstly, Russia, has been inching forward in recent months on the eastern front (albeit at a huge cost to personnel and equipment), and inflicting almost daily aerial attacks on Ukraine’s cities. And secondly, the US, Ukraine’s biggest backer, has now withheld crucial military aid, in response to a public falling-out between Zelensky and US President Donald Trump. The aid is now restored, but the episode has left Ukraine on shaky ground.
“That makes Ukraine’s situation now very precarious,” said Sabine Fischer, senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “Ukraine from… the Trump administration’s perspective has become an obstacle to this normalization that they want for their relationship with Russia.”
2. No quick deal
Experts agree the Minsk accords were put together hastily as violence escalated. Johannes Regenbrecht, a former German civil servant who was involved in the negotiations, pointed out in a recent paper that Ukraine’s allies had reached the point in February 2015 where they worried that allowing Russia to continue unchecked “would have resulted in the de facto secession of eastern Ukraine under Moscow’s control.”
With hindsight, experts say, the resulting document left too much ambiguity when it came to implementing the deal. The thorniest issue was how to link the military provisions (a ceasefire and withdrawal of weapons), with the political ones (local elections, and a “special regime” in the separatist-controlled areas).
“Ukraine was saying, we need security first and then we can implement the political provisions. Russia was saying, once political provisions are implemented, separatists will be satisfied and will stop fighting,” said Dumoulin, now director of the Wider Europe program at the European Council on Foreign Relations. That initial disagreement was an early sign of what Dumoulin and other experts see as Moscow’s ultimate intention to use the political provisions of Minsk to gain greater control over Ukraine.
Fischer argues that Trump’s desire to end the war quickly suggests the US may not only be at risk of reaching a flawed deal in haste, but may actually be willing to settle for something that doesn’t offer long-term solutions. “Comprehensive ceasefire agreements are not negotiated quickly… they’re very complicated, many intricacies… And I don’t think that this is what the Trump administration is aiming for,” she told CNN.
3. Beware the false narratives
In the end, the biggest issue with the Minsk accords, especially Minsk II, wasn’t what was in the text, but what wasn’t. There’s not one mention of “Russia” in the entire text, despite clear evidence that Russia was both arming the separatists, and sending reinforcements from the Russian army.
“Everyone knew that Russia was involved, but for the sake of the negotiations, this was not recognized,” said Dumoulin. “The agreements were based on the fiction that the war was between separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk and Kyiv, and that it was ultimately a domestic conflict.”
There is no direct parallel today but there is, experts say, a risk Moscow is now using the false narrative that Zelensky is illegitimate because he failed to hold elections – Ukrainian law clearly states elections cannot be held during martial law – to rebrand the war as something that should be solved internally in Ukraine, and ultimately bring about regime change.
And even more concerning for Ukraine is that the US has taken a similar line, with Trump last month labeling Zelensky “a dictator without elections,” although he subsequently appeared to distance himself from that statement.
The failure of the Minsk accords leaves no doubt as to the risks of perpetuating such falsehoods.
Back then, the fiction that Russia wasn’t an aggressor or party to the conflict, along with insufficient pressure on Moscow in the form of sanctions or the provision of lethal military supplies to Ukraine, ultimately meant Minsk never addressed the root cause of the conflict.
“The fundamental contradiction of Minsk,” wrote Regenbrecht, “was that Putin sought to end Ukraine as an independent nation… Consequently, he had no interest in a constructive political process.”
There’s no evidence that that position has changed. In his speech on February 21, 2022, three days before the full-scale invasion, Putin described Ukraine as “an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” before claiming, “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood.”
In January this year, one of his closest aides, Nikolai Patrushev, said he couldn’t rule out “that Ukraine will cease to exist at all in the coming year.”
And so, even amid US promises of keeping Ukraine out of NATO, and forcing them to accept territorial losses, the negotiating teams in Saudi Arabia have so far, it seems – just like their predecessors in Minsk – come nowhere close to tackling that core issue.",['Clare Sebastian'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/politics/cnn-poll-ukraine-war/index.html,CNN Poll: Most Americans disapprove of Trump’s approach to Ukraine war,2025-03-14 09:00:52,"Americans are skeptical that President Donald Trump’s approach to the war between Russia and Ukraine will bring peace to the region, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Most Americans view Trump’s handling of the conflict negatively, and 50% say his approach to the war is bad for the United States.
US diplomats are currently working to persuade Russia to agree to a temporary ceasefire in the war that has dragged on for more than three years since Russia’s invasion. While the Biden administration strongly backed Ukraine and unambiguously blamed Russia for the conflict, Trump has blamed Ukraine for causing the war and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator, drawing complaints from European allies and domestic critics.
CNN’s latest poll finds that 59% of Americans think it’s not too likely or not at all likely that Trump’s approach will bring long-term peace between Russia and Ukraine, while 41% say it’s at least somewhat likely. More broadly, nearly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the US relationship with Russia (59%), and 55% disapprove of his handling of the situation in Ukraine.
Half of Americans think that Trump’s approach to the war between Russia and Ukraine is bad for the US, compared to only 29% who think it’s good for the US (20% say it does not make a difference). This mirrors Americans’ broader views of Trump’s foreign policy moves so far in his second term: while 30% say his decisions have helped America’s standing in the world, more than half (54%) say that they’ve hurt America’s standing.
A sizable share of Republicans express doubts about Trump’s approach to foreign policy, including 15% who see his foreign policy decisions as having hurt America’s standing in the world, 18% who say his approach to the war between Russia and Ukraine is bad for the US and 28% who believe his approach is unlikely to result in long-term peace between the two countries. Democrats are more unified around negative views of Trump’s foreign policy choices.
Deep partisan splits
A broad majority of Americans view Ukraine as either an ally or friendly to the US (72%) and Russia as either unfriendly or an enemy to the US (81%). The share that considers Ukraine to be an ally has climbed 7 points since 2014, just after Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Negative views of Russia have also changed since then, with the share describing Russia as an enemy climbing from 25% in May 2014 to 41% by 2018 and 44% now.
Americans are closely split on whether the US is doing too much (32%), too little (38%) or the right amount (30%) for Ukraine in its war with Russia. In January 2024, 30% of Americans said the US was doing too little for Ukraine.
The public’s view of Trump’s handling of the war breaks sharply along partisan lines, with 84% of Republicans approving of how Trump is handling the situation in Ukraine compared with just 10% of Democrats. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats say the US is doing too little to help Ukraine in its war with Russia, while roughly half of Republicans say the US is doing too much.
Democrats and Republicans also differ in how they view the two countries. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to view Ukraine as at least friendly (82% of Democrats say so, compared with 64% of Republicans) and to view Russia as an enemy (54%, compared with 36% for Republicans).
In the aftermath of a highly publicized confrontation in the Oval Office between Zelensky, Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Americans are more likely to view Zelensky positively than negatively (39% to 33%, with 28% expressing no opinion). Roughly two-thirds of Democrats view Zelensky positively, and 63% of Republicans view him negatively. The poll finds both Trump and Vance with net negative favorability ratings overall (42% favorable to 52% unfavorable for Trump, 33% to 44% for Vance).
Broader foreign policy doubts
The poll also finds a majority of Americans with negative views towards Trump’s broader approach to international relations. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say they disapprove of his handling of foreign affairs, while 54% say that Trump is not an effective world leader and 56% say that Trump’s cuts to federal programs will hurt the nation’s standing in the world (compared to 28% who say the cuts will help, and 15% saying they will neither help nor hurt).
This assessment of Trump’s handling of foreign affairs comes amid a chaotic start to his second term: since the election in November, Trump has threatened to seize territories from allies, frozen foreign aid programs (resulting in intensifying humanitarian crises), announced a wide range of tariffs (including some targeting the United States’ largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico), cut off military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine in the aftermath of the Oval Office meeting with Zelensky, and suggested a plan to displace all Palestinians from Gaza.
Americans are split on whether the US should take a leading role in solving international problems (51% say it should and 49% say it should not). This cuts across party lines, with 58% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, and 50% of Republicans and Republican-leaners saying that the US should take a leading role. This is a reversal from the past: in 2015, only 37% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted the country to take a leading role and a slim majority, 54%, of Republican-aligned adults said the same.
Shifting views of allies, enemies
The poll also finds Americans’ views toward other nations shifting, as fewer see a deep connection to the US’s traditional European allies, and unfriendly sentiments about Canada and Mexico are on the rise.
American sentiment towards traditional European allies tested in the poll has dropped uniformly since August 2018. Just 58% now describe Great Britain as an ally, down from 66% in 2018. That figure has dropped from 49% to 39% for Germany, and from 56% to 45% for France. Americans are also more likely to view Mexico and Canada negatively compared to the past – only about half of Americans call Canada an ally now (that has been as high as 65% in a 2000 CNN poll) and only 25% feel that way toward Mexico (40% felt that way in 2000).
Americans’ views of Israel have also shifted somewhat more negative. While 73% call Israel an ally or friendly, similar to the 75% who felt that way in 2018, the 27% who describe it as unfriendly or an enemy is the highest share to say so in CNN polling back to 2000.
Across the countries tested in the poll, respondents are most likely to rate Iran as unfriendly to or an enemy of the United States (88%), followed by North Korea (85%), Russia (81%), and China (74%). Respondents split on their views of Saudi Arabia, with 50% describing it as an ally or friendly and 49% saying it is unfriendly or an enemy.
The poll also finds continued deterioration in American’s views of China. In 2011, 62% of Americans viewed China as an ally or friendly to the US, which declined to 45% in 2018 and 25% in CNN’s most recent poll.
Americans’ generally warm views of Ukraine and Israel don’t always translate to a desire for the US to support their war efforts. A quarter of those who view Ukraine as at least friendly say that the US is doing too much to help the nation in its war with Russia, and 29% of Americans who view Israel as at least friendly say that the US is providing too much assistance to the nation in its war with Hamas.
Overall, 34% say that the US is doing too much for Israel in its war against Hamas, with 47% saying the US is doing the right amount and 19% too little. In January 2024, 29% said the US was doing too little for Israel.
The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from March 6-9 among a random national sample of 1,206 US adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among all adults have a margin of sampling error of ±3.3 percentage points.

“In the course of the offensive operations, units of the North military group liberated the settlements of Melovoy, Podol and Sudzha,” the Russian defense ministry said Thursday.
The US-based conflict monitor the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) also said footage from the ground indicated that Russian forces had seized Sudzha and advanced to southern Zaoleshenka, a settlement just northwest of the town.
Its recapture would represent a major symbolic victory for Russia. Although Sudzha is a small place, with a population of about 5,000 people before Ukraine’s incursion, it was one of the only key towns still held by Ukraine.
It comes as US special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow Thursday, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Witkoff is expected to brief Russian officials on the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire covering the entire frontline, which Ukraine has already accepted.
Speaking on the regular call with reporters Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed confidence that all parts of the Kursk region held by Ukraine will soon be liberated.
“President (Vladimir Putin) said that this needs to be done as quickly as possible. (It will take) as much time as is necessary to save the maximum number of lives of our military and civilians. But there is no doubt that the Kursk region will be liberated fairly soon,” Peskov said asked how long it might take to push the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the area.
Putin made a surprise visit to the Kursk region on Wednesday. Wearing military uniform in video broadcast by Russian state television, the Russian president told frontline troops that Moscow’s goal is to “completely liberate” Kursk as soon as possible, during his first trip to the western region since Ukraine’s unexpected incursion there last year.
The carefully choreographed visit appeared designed to boost morale as Russian forces advance on the final remnants of Ukraine’s holdouts inside Russia.
Putin delivered a speech to soldiers, in which he urged them to oust the remaining Ukrainian forces in the region and raised the possibility of creating a “buffer zone” along Russia’s border with Ukraine.
Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk should be treated as “terrorists,” Putin added.
Ukraine launched its shock incursion into Kursk in August, swiftly capturing territory in what was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II. As well as capturing land that could potentially be swapped for Russian-occupied territory, the campaign aimed to divert Moscow’s resources from the frontlines in Ukraine’s east.
But Kyiv has struggled to hold onto its captured territory, with its grip on the region rapidly deteriorating in recent days.
On Wednesday, Ukraine’s top general Oleksandr Syrskyi hinted at further tactical retreats to “more favorable positions,” saying his priority was to “save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.” Russia had carried out airstrikes on its own land, including the town of Sudzha, which was “almost completely destroyed,” Syrskyi added.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told reporters on Wednesday: “The Russians are clearly trying to put maximum pressure on our troops. The military command is doing what it has to do, saving as many lives as possible.”
Russia’s top general Valery Gerasimov claimed Wednesday that Russian forces had recaptured more than 86% of the area taken by Ukraine, that 430 Ukrainian soldiers had been taken prisoner – and the remaining Ukrainians were surrounded.

Russia’s lightning advance in Kursk threatens Kyiv’s sole territorial bargaining counter at a crucial time in the war when a potential ceasefire hangs in the balance.
US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the ball is now in Putin’s court as US representatives headed to Russia “right now as we speak,” to discuss the ceasefire proposal.
“We’re going to have to see. It’s up to Russia now,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, as he declined to comment on whether he has a meeting scheduled with the Russian leader.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that Putin was “carefully studying” the proposal, as Moscow waits to be briefed by US officials in the coming days.
Hours later, Russian state media footage showed Putin meeting with his top general Valery Gerasimov in Kursk before delivering a speech to soldiers, in which he urged them to oust the remaining Ukrainian forces in the region and raised the possibility of creating a “buffer zone” along Russia’s border with Ukraine.

Peskov on Thursday said the operation to oust the remaining Ukrainian forces has entered its final stage, state news agency TASS said.

The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said in its update on Thursday that geolocated footage indicated Russian forces had seized Sudzha and were already advancing past the town.
Trump’s Special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to travel to Russia later this week, though it is unclear whether he plans to meet with Putin, with whom he met last month.

The ceasefire proposal accepted by Ukraine covers the entire front line of the fighting with Russia, not just the air and sea, Zelensky said after the more than eight-hour long meeting.
“Ukraine accepts this proposal, we consider it positive, we are ready to take such a step, and the United States of America must convince Russia to do so,” Zelensky said, adding that the ceasefire would start the moment Moscow agrees to it.
The United States said in a joint statement with Ukraine following the meeting in Jeddah that it would “immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.” A Ukrainian official confirmed on Tuesday that US security assistance to Ukraine had resumed.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said immediately after the meeting that the onus is now on Russia to take steps to end the war. “We hope that they’ll say yes, that they’ll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court,” he said of the Russians.
US President Donald Trump later welcomed the news and vowed to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the plan, potentially this week.
On Wednesday, Zelensky said he believes Kyiv “can expect” the US to take “strong steps” against Russia if Moscow was to reject the ceasefire proposal.
“I don’t know details, but we are talking about respective sanction actions and strengthening of Ukraine,” Zelensky told reporters at a news conference in Kyiv. “Everything depends on Russia. The US took steps, Ukraine made (its) position clear. Now Russia needs to respond.”
Tuesday’s talks occurred at a crucial time in the war, as Moscow’s forces continue to advance in the Kursk region of Russia – where Ukraine launched a shock incursion in August – threatening Kyiv’s sole territorial bargaining counter.
The US-Ukraine joint statement emphasized that Kyiv had “expressed readiness to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation.”
“The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace,” it said.
Zelensky said Ukraine’s proposals for the ceasefire had included “silence” in the sky and at sea, the release of Ukrainian prisoners “to establish confidence in this whole situation,” and the return of Ukrainian children from Russia.
The two sides also agreed to conclude a rare minerals deal “as soon as possible” to expand Ukraine’s economy and guarantee the country’s long-term security.
The developments will be a huge relief for Kyiv after the extraordinarily public blowup between Trump and Ukraine’s leader less than two weeks ago.
The Ukrainian delegation, which did not include Zelensky, met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Both Rubio and Waltz attended direct talks with Russia last month.
Trump and European allies welcome ceasefire plan
The US president heralded the news, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday, “Hopefully President Putin will agree to that also and we can get this show on the road.”
“I think it’s a very big, I think it’s a big difference between the last visit you saw in the Oval Office, and that’s a total ceasefire,” Trump said, referencing last month’s explosive Oval Office confrontation.
“Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it – we’re going to meet with them later on today and tomorrow, and hopefully we’ll be able to (work) out a deal,” the president said. “But I think the ceasefire is very important, if we can get Russia to do it, that’ll be great. If we can’t, we just keep going on, and people are going to get killed.”
Pressed in a follow-up exchange on if he’d invite Zelensky back to the White House, he told reporters, “Sure, absolutely.”
Trump added that he hopes to speak with Putin later this week and that he hopes a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine will take effect “over the next few days.”
“I’ll talk to Vladimir Putin, I want to get – look, that’s the other, it takes two to tango, as they say, right?” Trump said. “So hopefully he’ll also agree.”
A spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry told CNN Tuesday that it does not rule out contact with US representatives in “the next few days.”
Asked about another possible meeting with Trump, Zelensky told reporters Wednesday: “I have not heard about the invitation. I think that any meeting we have with the president of America should end with a positive outcome for both sides. And I think that’s how we should approach any of our meetings.”
European leaders were quick to endorse the ceasefire proposal, days after pledges were made to rearm the continent amid fears the US was ripping up 80 years of security guarantees.
The European Union called the agreement a “positive development,” while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer congratulated the leaders of both countries on a “remarkable breakthrough.”
Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said the talks are “an important step toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” but added that “the responsibility rests solely on Russia.”
Other European officials from countries including The Netherlands, Sweden, the Czech Republic and France – whose President Emmanuel Macron proposed a one-month truce earlier this month, a plan backed by the United Kingdom – also welcomed the news.
The Ukrainian and American officials met in Jeddah just hours after Russia said it was hit by a “massive” Ukrainian drone attack. Moscow’s defense ministry said it had downed 337 drones it claimed Ukraine had fired at Russia, of which 91 had targeted the Moscow region. Local officials said three people were killed and at least six wounded.
If the figure is confirmed, the aerial attacks would represent one of the largest on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, and a clear attempt to show strength on the part of Kyiv.
Russian forces currently occupy nearly 20% of Ukraine’s territory, up from the roughly 7% Moscow controlled before it launched its unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022. Some 6 million Ukrainians live under Russian occupation.
Putin has made clear that he wants Moscow to gain control over the entirety of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.
According to the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, Russia currently occupies about 99% of the Luhansk region and 70% of the Donetsk region, as well as roughly 75% of both the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/europe/analysis-trump-russia-ukraine-ceasefire-intl-latam,Analysis: This Russia-Ukraine ceasefire proposal just called Putin’s bluff,2025-03-12 01:13:44,"The Kremlin is keeping tight-lipped on the US peace plan, but with Ukraine signed up to the ceasefire, the pressure is now on Moscow to decide if it will also accept President Donald Trump’s proposals to bring the Ukraine war to a halt, albeit a temporary one.
On his daily media call, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, refused to be drawn on the issue, saying that the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz are first expected to brief Moscow about the terms of the ceasefire, which were set out at US Ukrainian talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.
“Rubio and Walz stated that they would provide us with detailed information about the essence of the conversations that took place in Jeddah through various diplomatic channels. First, we must receive this information. We also have contacts with the Americans planned for these days, during which we expect to have complete information,” Peskov told reporters.
For Moscow, this is fast becoming a pivotal moment of truth and one which may require awkward compromises if it is serious about peace.
The Kremlin has long claimed to be open to negotiations to end the conflict, while always insisting it must achieve its ambitious war aims, such as securing control over all annexed areas of Ukraine.
Only last week, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin strongman who launched this brutal war three years ago, vowed to a group of tearful widows and mothers of killed Russian soldiers, that Moscow would never “give in.”
Most Russians, fatigued by the conflict and anxious about its dire economic impact, may be keen to see the fight end, which could result in biting sanctions being eased. But pro-war Russian hardliners, at times encouraged by the Kremlin, will see any early ceasefire as a betrayal.
But a climbdown of some sort may be inevitable.
Even if Russian negotiators can impose their own conditions on the ceasefire – a Ukrainian withdrawal from Kursk, for example, the small pocket of Russia captured by Ukraine, where fighting is now raging – it is hard to imagine that its greater territorial demands, yet alone the goal of removing NATO from its western flank, would be met.
Likewise, there may some acceptance of any Russian calls for limitations on Ukrainian long-range weaponry. But as this stage, demands for the demilitarization of Ukraine, a stated Russian war aim, are likely to be seen as a step too far.
The Kremlin’s response is also a moment of truth for the oddly warm Putin-Trump relationship.
For weeks, Russians have reveled, gleefully, in America’s apparent shift in their favor, a move that has bewildered Washington’s traditional Western allies.
The two countries are engaged in significant talks aimed at rebuilding economic and diplomatic ties, most recently an agreement was reached between the CIA and the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR, to reduce confrontation between Moscow and Washington, according to an SVR statement.
Even Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov – until recently a harsh critic of Washington – has welcomed the fresh US stance toward Moscow.
“I think what is going on in the United States is a return to normalcy,” he told US bloggers when asked whether the US had changed since Trump’s second inauguration.
But in exchange for all the courting, concessions and praise, Trump may now expect the Kremlin leader to play ball – or risk his wrath.
Indeed, “the ball is now in their court,” is precisely what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said of the Russians after his talks with Ukrainian officials concluded in Jeddah. On Wednesday, the top US diplomat suggested that Moscow is “probably processing” the news of the temporary truce “the same as the rest of the world.”
Trump, of course, prefers a poker metaphor.
Just days ago, Trump claimed “Russia holds all the cards.” Now, intentionally or not, he may have called Putin’s bluff.

A 30-day ceasefire is, unhesitatingly, good news, at first. But a truce is the most complex, and damaged idea of this decade-long conflict. And how it endures will define Ukraine’s support, sovereignty and survival.
After likely hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian and Russian dead, it will be hard for any side to refuse the concept of a truce. Moscow will be under pressure to show it is not the obstacle to US President Donald Trump’s goal of peace at almost any cost.
This is a surreal place for the Kremlin to occupy, after three years of savage aggression and little public desire to end the war outside of the US-Russia diplomacy of the past two months. To maintain the illusion he is Trump’s partner in this, Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely accept some form of peace. It may not be an immediate ceasefire, and he may, as Russia has before, choose to delay its start to pursue military goals first, particularly in the Kursk region, where Ukraine is close to being kicked out of the sliver of Russia it’s held since August.
But then reality will greet the theory of telephone diplomacy. The first argument to be tested is the Kremlin cannot be trusted to engage in meaningful diplomacy as its history shows it rarely does. The second argument is Kyiv retains maximalist ambitions to regain its territory, and is refusing the freezing of the front lines, as this would mean the likely permanent loss of a fifth of its land, and because Ukraine will likely not re-equip with the same vigor as Moscow and be at a disadvantage when Russia attacks again. These ideas too will be challenged.
It is, however, clear now that most Ukrainians feel a counteroffensive to retake territory is a fever dream, when the basic task of fending off Russian assaults is beset by ammunition and manpower shortages.
But the ghastly grit and chaos of this war is unlikely to be kind to a truce. Instead, any ceasefire will likely devolve into a pitched battle to assign blame for its collapse.
The Kremlin head’s main goal, for now, is to continue to enforce Trump’s suspicions that Zelensky is the impediment to his peace. Putin cannot refuse a ceasefire, without losing the fictitious moral high ground. But it is what comes next – or during any pause in hostilities – that will define the outcome of the war.
Firstly, it is a complete ceasefire, across all front lines, for an entire month. This is, in and of itself, a very big ask. Across hundreds of miles, both sides have for years used armor, then artillery, then drones to hunt each other viciously, amid what is now called ‘beetroot’ – the horrific mulch of corpses discarded in combat – on the zero line. The expectation is that for a month, suddenly, this can all stop. That there will be no mistakes. That nobody will open fire in panic, or to settle scores. That a cooking gas cannister won’t detonate in error, and spark a shoot-out that breaks the peace permanently.
For this reason, some European officials and Ukraine had initially proposed a partial ceasefire of air, sea and attacks on energy infrastructure. Their argument was this would be more easily monitored – that violations would be more simply attributed to either side. Yet this argument has been rejected in Jeddah for something much wider-ranging. If Moscow agrees, everything has to suddenly stop for a month.
It is near impossible there will not be errors, or clashes. In the past Russia has exceled at misinformation, maskirovka – deceit as a tactic on the battlefield – as well as false flag operations, when incidents are staged to provide the impetus for retaliation. There will be moments, in any month’s pause, where small arms clashes, or drone strikes, prove impossible to attribute to either side as the aggressor: where AI-manipulation, or faked accounts, or entirely fictitious incidents, fill the information space.
Algorithms will seek to amplify falsehoods. World leaders will struggle to have a cogent grasp of minor details of who-shot-who on the front line. Areas where seismic events have occurred will prove out of reach to investigators owing to the violence that erupts again.
The evidence of the past decade should lead to pessimism, and deceit has flown almost entirely one way. Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 but pretended it had not. Russia agreed to a ceasefire in 2015, and in its first days took the Ukrainian town of Debaltseve. Russia said it would not launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but did. Russia said at first it was not using prisoners on the front line, but now some of its jails are near empty.
Moscow’s track record should underpin every assessment of how any peace lasts. To quote the poem Trump cited to defend his hostile position on migrants: “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” We should be clear-eyed about the Kremlin’s goals. They will not be achieved by the freezing of the front line. Putin needs a wider victory to justify the losses this far, and to satisfy his exaggerated idea of the threat the West now poses to him.
The risk is clear: that a truce collapses, likely due to Russian action, Trump incorrectly believes Ukraine is to blame for spoiling his peace, and Ukraine’s aid is again frozen, this time with a more vindictive edge as they have been deemed the aggressor. Moscow claims it is the victim again, and launches another intense assault on Ukraine, where a brief calm has led to a slowing in Western aid and military readiness.
As Marco Rubio, US Secretary of State, said of Moscow: “The ball is now in their court.” This is true and admirable as an outcome. But it is also the case that Russia excels at grabbing the ball, pocketing it, debating the rules of the game and points lost three sets ago, before claiming the ball has in fact been stolen clean from them by the other team.
The White House is about to get a masterclass in real Kremlin diplomacy. Trump’s disruptive and at times blunt methods brought us here. If applied to Moscow as bluntly and disruptively, they may reduce the biggest security threat in Europe since the Nazis. But they may also appear too fleeting in application, and too basic in scope to deal with the cool deception and glacial patience of Moscow.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

Ukraine also agreed to a proposed ceasefire in its war with Russia. President Donald Trump had recently halted all future shipments of military aid.
As shipments could begin again soon, CNN looks at what exactly was in the military aid sent by the United States so far, how much was sent and how a resumption could impact Ukraine’s war efforts.
The US has given $69 billion in military aid
The US is the largest single donor to the war-torn nation, sending at least $123 billion in total aid to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Military aid made up $69 billion of that, or 56% of the US total, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine.
Ukraine has expanded its domestic production of military equipment including the manufacturing of drones and artillery munitions. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said recently it now produces more than 30% of the equipment and ammunition needed to defend itself.
Zelensky has stated that military supplies from the US cover about 40% of its defense needs, with other — mostly European — allies making up the other approximately 30%.
Europe had rallied behind Ukraine in the days following the disastrous Oval Office meeting, pledging to strengthen its support for Kyiv as US foreign policy shifts away.
What the military assets are
Among the specific equipment sent from the US to Ukraine are air defense systems, drones, rocket launchers, radars, tanks and anti-armor weapons.
The US has been supplying Ukraine with military equipment under the Presidential Drawdown Authority since August 2021 in response to Russia preparing to launch its full-scale invasion. The mechanism allows the president to draw equipment for Ukraine directly from US stocks.
The US has used this method on 55 occasions to provide about $31.7 billion worth of military assistance for Ukraine, according to a report from the State Department.
Stopping the flow of this aid would have been disastrous for Ukraine, with one Ukrainian official warning that the country could have run out of vital artillery shells by May or June.
While the EU intended help fill some gaps, there are some things only the US can provide, for example the Patriot air defense system, which has proven uniquely effective in countering Russian ballistic missiles. The US controls the licensing and the production of that system and its missiles.
The US beats out Europe on supplying heavy weapons
As Ukraine’s top military aid donor, the US has sent the most howitzers (a type of artillery weapon), anti-aircraft surface-to-air missile systems and multiple launch rocket systems. Meanwhile, Poland has supplied and pledged the most tanks, Kiel Institute data shows.
Here’s the status of delivered and pending shipments as of the end of 2024:
It would have been extremely difficult for Ukraine’s European allies to fill the United States’ shoes. In 2023, overall military expenditures for the 27 EU member states and the United Kingdom totaled around $388 billion, whereas the US spent $916 billion, or about two times as much. The US also allocated 9% of government spending to defense, which was the highest among NATO countries, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Moscow’s defense ministry said it had downed 343 drones it claimed Ukraine had fired at Russia, of which 91 had targeted the Moscow region. It also said six Ukrainian strike drones were intercepted near Russia’s Kursk nuclear power plant.
If the figure is confirmed, the aerial attacks would represent one of the largest on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.
Falling debris damaged buildings in Moscow, in what mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Telegram was a “most massive” attack.
Three people were killed and at least six wounded in the Moscow region, local officials said. Regional Gov. Andrey Vorobyev said on Telegram that the falling debris started a fire in a parking lot that burned through more than 20 cars.
Ukraine’s Armed Forces said it targeted the production facilities of the Moscow Oil Refinery, and claimed “civilian infrastructure facilities were damaged as a result of the Russian aggressor’s air defense.”
Video geolocated by CNN shows an explosion at an apartment building in the southern Moscow region.
The attacks forced two Moscow airports to close for safety reasons, as well as two airports east of the city, according to state-run news agency TASS, adding that several flights to Moscow were redirected to other airports.
Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Air Force said it had defended against Russian ballistic missile and drone attacks overnight. At least one person was killed and 18 injured, according to a CNN tally of figures released by various Ukrainian officials.
Talks in Saudi Arabia
The attacks come ahead of Tuesday’s talks between the US and Ukrainian delegations in Saudi Arabia, which are now in progress. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security adviser Mike Waltz are meeting the Ukrainian national security adviser, foreign minister and defense minister.
“We will protect Ukrainian interests, have a clear vision of ending the war, and work effectively with our American partners,” Zelensky’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said earlier on Tuesday.
Ahead of the meeting, Rubio said the US wanted to hear what concessions Ukraine would be willing to make in negotiations to end the war with Russia, and that the talks could determine whether Washington resumes providing military aid and full intelligence sharing with Kyiv.
CNN previously reported that the US is still sharing intelligence with Ukraine that can help its troops defend themselves but has “scaled back” sharing details that could be used for offensive targeting of Russian forces, according to two US defense officials.
Fighting on the ground has intensified in recent weeks as the US-Ukraine relationship has soured, following the shouting match between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.
Russia launched a major aerial assault on Ukraine last Friday and Saturday that killed more than two dozen people, according to Ukrainian authorities; another series of attacks killed six more civilians from Sunday to Monday.
Ukraine’s presence in Russia’s Kursk region is also shrinking sharply, with the Russian advance threatening Kyiv’s sole territorial bargaining counter at a crucial time in the war.
Ukraine’s reported attack on Moscow Tuesday appeared to be larger than its previous largest assault on the Russian capital last November.
Russia said it downed 34 Ukrainian drones during that attack, which injured a woman, forced the temporary closure of airspace and caused two houses to catch fire.
Last September, Russia said it destroyed at least 20 Ukrainian drones near Moscow in an attack that killed at least one person and forced airport closures in the capital.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman embraced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after he landed in the Red Sea city of Jeddah Monday night. His arrival came ahead of a meeting between top US officials and Ukranian officials and just a week after US President Donald Trump publicly scolded Zelensky for being “ungrateful” in an awkward showdown at the White House.
Saudi Arabia mediated between top US and Russian officials last month for the first direct talks between Washington and Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The location for these talks – described at the time by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as one that “generally suits” the United States and Russia – is widely considered a win for the kingdom’s 39-year-old de facto leader, Prince Mohammed. He’s on a mission to transform his oil-rich country and its fundamentalist Islamist past, into a nation that can cultivate soft power from immense wealth.
“I don’t think there’s another place where the leader has such a good personal relationship with both Trump and Putin,” Saudi commentator Ali Shihabi said, adding that for “Saudi Arabia, (the event is) prestigious and enhances the Saudi soft power regionally and globally.”
It’s all part of a wider shift. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has realigned its policies towards neutrality in global conflicts with the hope of steering away from war and closer to attracting the billions of dollars in investments that could help achieve “Vision 2030” – the crown prince’s plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil. Prince Mohammed has significantly pulled back from Yemen after years of war with the neighboring Iran-backed Houthis, he is mending ties with regional rival Iran and has maintained close relationships with China and Russia – all while preserving the close Saudi relationship with the West.
Ties with both Putin and Trump
In addition to hosting international boxing bouts and electronic music festivals, Saudi Arabia has sought to project an image of being a global peacekeeper, hosting aid donor meetings and peace conferences. In August 2023, it hosted a two-day peace summit on Ukraine with representatives from more than 40 countries (albeit without Russia), and in February of the same year, pledged $400 million in aid to Ukraine.
Prince Mohammed’s ascension as a powerbroker in the talks stems from his close relationship with Trump, who supported the young royal when he was internationally shunned following the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 by Saudi agents.
In 2017, Trump broke with tradition by choosing Saudi Arabia for his first international presidential visit. Even after he lost the 2020 election, Saudi Arabia continued close business ties with Trump, investing $2 billion in a firm chaired by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and announcing plans to build Trump towers in the kingdom.
Trump announced on Friday that he will once again choose Saudi Arabia as his first foreign visit as president, following the kingdom’s pledge to invest $1 trillion in American companies over four years.
“This time. they’ve gotten richer and we’ve all gotten older, so I said I’ll go if you pay 1 trillion dollars to American companies… they’ve agreed to do that so I’m going to be going there. I have a great relationship with them,” Trump said on Friday.
The crown prince also has warm ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who refused to isolate the prince after the Khashoggi murder. Prince Mohammed resisted Western pressure to alienate Moscow after Ukraine’s invasion and continued coordinating closely with Putin to control global oil supply, even siding with Russia by rebuffing calls from the Biden administration to ramp up oil production in 2022. Putin visited the kingdom in 2023 and has courted Riyadh to join BRICS – a bloc of countries seeking to counter US economic influence.
The hedging of Saudi Arabia’s relations in an increasingly polarized world has proven beneficial, analysts say. Prince bin Salman was “instrumental” in the release of American teacher Mark Fogel from Russian custody last month, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said. Saudi Arabia, along with its neighbor the United Arab Emirates, was also successful in mediating several prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia.
Last month’s talks between Russia and the US did not include Ukraine. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security adviser Mike Waltz are set to meet the Ukrainian national security adviser, foreign minister and defense minister.
An eye on Gaza
Longer term, Saudi Arabia may aim to use its role as a mediator in the meeting between Russia and the US to capitalize on a pressing regional matter – Trump’s controversial suggestion that the US take ownership of Gaza and permanently relocate its residents.
In February, Trump laid out a vision of bringing peace to the Middle East by redeveloping the war-torn Gaza strip with “Riviera”-style premium housing and permanently relocating its more than 2 million residents.
Arab countries swiftly rejected the idea and leaders met in Cairo this month to endorse a $53-billion reconstruction plan that would ensure that Palestinians aren’t relocated from Gaza.
“By facilitating President Trump’s stated goal of ending the Ukraine war, Saudi Arabia is well-positioned to accumulate goodwill in Washington. The kingdom… could capitalize on its rising stock with the Trump administration to help bridge the gap between the US and Arab positions on the fate of Gaza,” said Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain.
The next four years could see Prince Mohammed banking on his close relationship with Trump – but the prince may still find himself in tough spots trying to balance his regional interests amid aggressive demands from the transactional American president.
Trump would like to see Saudi-Israel relations normalized, but amid growing anger in the Middle East over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, defending a path to Palestinian statehood is politically non-negotiable for Prince bin Salman.
“Achieving lasting and just peace is impossible without the Palestinian people obtaining their legitimate rights in accordance with international resolutions, as has been previously clarified to both the former and current U.S. administrations,” the kingdom said in a statement earlier this month in reaction to Trump’s Gaza plan.",['Mostafa Salem'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/politics/rubio-ukraine-saudi-meeting/index.html,Rubio says the US wants to hear what concessions Ukraine is willing to make at Saudi meeting,2025-03-10 19:50:21,"The United States wants to hear what concessions Ukraine would be willing to make in negotiations to end the war with Russia, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said ahead of a high-stakes meeting between the two nations on Tuesday.
“We really want to sort of ascertain where they stand on this and what they’re willing to do in order to achieve peace,” Rubio told reporters on Monday.
The discussions in the Saudi port city of Jeddah comes as the relationship between Washington and Kyiv is at its lowest point since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago. Following a contentious Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the US announced a “pause” on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Russia has continued its deadly barrage of attacks against Ukraine in the time since that suspension was put in place.
The move followed weeks of antagonism by Trump towards Zelensky that has seen the US president repeat Kremlin talking points blaming Kyiv for the war and after Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff sat down in Riyadh with a high-level Russian delegation – and without Ukrainian participation.
Speaking Monday, Rubio said the outcome of Tuesday’s meeting “will be key” to whether the pause in military aid and intelligence sharing is lifted.
“I think if we emerge there with a good meeting that we feel good about and can report back to the president, then I think decisions will be made in regards to the pause,” he said.
CNN has reported that the US is still sharing intelligence with Ukraine that can help its troops defend themselves but has “scaled back” sharing any intelligence that Kyiv could use for offensive targeting of Russian forces, according to two US defense officials.
“My hope is we’re going to have a really good meeting tomorrow, and we’ll be in a different place very soon,” Rubio said.
Rubio and Waltz, who are slated to meet with the Ukrainian national security adviser, foreign minister, and defense minister, will be “in listening mode,” the top US diplomat said.
“They’ve suffered greatly, and their people have suffered greatly, and it’s hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions, but that’s the only way this is going to end, to prevent more suffering,” Rubio said, adding that he’s “not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do.”
The top US diplomat acknowledged that the moves Ukraine would be willing to make “may be incompatible with what the Russians are willing to do.”
“That’s what we need to find out. We’re not going to find out on X. We’re not going to find out, you know, on media, press conferences. We have to find out in rooms that are closed,” Rubio added, just over a week since the meeting between Trump and Zelensky went off the rails in front of cameras.
Rubio said the conversation would not be overly detailed – “we’re not going to be sitting in a room drawing lines on a map” – but that the US aims to “get a general sense of what concessions are in the realm of the possible for them and what they would need in return and then find out what the Russian position is in that regard. And that’ll give us a pretty good assessment of how far apart we truly are.”
In a post on X last Thursday, Zelensky said he hoped the meeting would be “meaningful.”
“Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first moment of the war, and we have always stated that the war continues solely because of Russia. Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing those steps,” he said. Zelensky is not expected to attend Tuesday’s meeting, although he is in Saudi Arabia.
In a separate post last Tuesday, Zelensky said the way the Oval Office meeting ended was “regrettable.” He proposed, as a first phase to end the war, “the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.”
“Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal,” he said.
On a minerals deal between the US and Ukraine – which had been largely negotiated before the Oval Office meeting – Zelensky said “Ukraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format.”
Rubio, however, said Monday he did not necessarily expect the agreement to be finalized on Tuesday.
“There’s still more details to work out,” he said.

The attacks come as the Ukrainian war is at a critical point, with the United States having halted military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv as part of efforts to pressure it into accepting a peace agreement. The move has left Ukraine even more vulnerable to Russian attacks.
“This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X Saturday. “More bombs, more aggression, more victims. Another tragic night in Ukraine.”
Russian strikes on the eastern city of Dobropillia killed 11 people and wounded at least 50 – including seven children, in attacks that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said were “deliberately calculated to cause maximum damage.”
“It was one of the most brutal strikes, a combined one,” Zelensky said in his nightly address on Saturday. He described a double strike on Dobropillia, where the second one hit just as rescue workers arrived on scene to attend to the victims of the first.
On Friday, after threatening Russia with sanctions to force through a ceasefire, US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was “doing what anybody else would do” in taking advantage of the current battlefield dynamics.
The White House also has suspended Ukraine’s access to commercial satellite imagery purchased by the US government through the company Maxar, spokespeople for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Maxar said Friday.
Ukrainian authorities said that more people could be trapped under the rubble in Dobropillia, with at least eight residential buildings in the area damaged in the attack.
Zelensky accused Moscow of “thinking not about how to end the war, but about how to destroy and capture more” as long as the world “allows” the war to continue.
He said Kyiv continued to “actively communicate” with European countries and was “in constant contact with the American team” to coordinate efforts to end the war.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on Friday and told him Trump was “determined to end the war as soon as possible and emphasized that all sides must take steps to secure a sustainable peace,” the State Department said.
Zelensky has said he will meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia next week ahead of negotiations between Kyiv and Washington. After that, his team will stay in Saudi Arabia “to work with our American partners,” he added.
Local officials said on Saturday that over the past day, Russian attacks had killed at least 23 people and wounded more than 50 in eastern and southern Ukraine.
In addition to those killed in Dobropillia, Russian attacks elsewhere in Donetsk killed nine others and wounded 13, according to local authorities.
Separately, a drone attack in the eastern Kharkiv region also killed three people and injured seven, Ukraine’s emergency service said, while five people were injured in attacks on the southern Kherson region, according to local officials.
Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 79 out of 145 drones launched by Russia overnight, while 54 drones did not reach their target.
Russia also used at least three missiles in its attack, the air force said, adding that it shot down at least one of the projectiles.
The attacks came just days after a deadly Russian airstrike on Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of Zelensky.
Under pressure in Kursk
Meanwhile, Ukraine is under severe pressure in the Russian region of Kursk and may soon lose a key logistical support route to its forces, according to Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers, after the arrival of fresh North Korean troops bolstered Russia’s offensive operations inside its own borders.
Ukraine launched a shock incursion into Kursk in August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – in the hope that it could divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and improve its hand ahead of potential ceasefire negotiations.
Although the invasion may have slowed Russia’s offensive in Ukraine, Kyiv has since lost about half of the territory it once occupied in Kursk. Moscow has called in foreign reinforcements and deployed some 12,000 North Korean troops to the region, according to Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports.
This week, military bloggers from both countries have warned that Ukraine’s hold on the territory is more tenuous than at any point since it launched the incursion, with Moscow’s forces entering Ukraine’s Sumy region and threatening to cut off Kyiv’s troops in Kursk.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/08/europe/ukraine-war-us-policy-shifts-analysis-intl/index.html,US policy shifts on Ukraine have left Kyiv reeling. This week may bring a clearer focus,2025-03-08 16:17:03,"The seismic shift of the past fortnight is hard to digest.
Ukraine and its allies hope, deeply, that the plank Kyiv has been slammed in the face with, is – to paraphrase US President Donald Trump’s presidential envoy to Ukraine – just to get its attention. That the White House is merely pausing military aid and intelligence sharing, demanding about half of the country’s mineral wealth to repay an alleged debt, and expecting a public apology from its president, as a negotiating ploy. That this is just tough talk ahead of a hard deal.
But a deeper change is apparent, and one that Europe has been reluctant to accept, and is scrambling to adjust to. The Trump administration sees itself not as an ally to Ukraine and its European backers, but as an intermediary between them and Moscow, hoping to rehabilitate Russia on the world stage. Trump has said he is “seriously considering” more sanctions on Moscow. Yet he has not applied them. So far, Russia has only tasted carrots and felt no sticks.
The pressure applied so far ahead of any deal is that of the contractor on its subcontractors – America on Ukraine and Europe – squeezing their terms to create a more attractive proposition for Russia. Hopes are high that a summit in Riyadh on Tuesday, between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s team, will heal the Kyiv-Washington relationship.
Yet almost too much hinges on this meeting. Personal enmities must be put aside. A deal on rare earths and other minerals – which is, in the last draft CNN saw, essentially toothless yet a bold sign of American ambitions as to Ukraine’s natural wealth – must be inked. And, most importantly, the White House must reveal what sort of peace it has in mind.
This is the chasm that lies beneath Trump’s insistence that Zelensky “commit to peace.” Does Trump mean an indefinable vibe only he can determine? Does he mean the germs of a European peace plan, which so far involves a prisoner swap, a partial ceasefire at sea, in the air and on energy infrastructure, followed by a limited European peacekeeping force? (Russian officials have rejected much of this already). Or does he mean another version of peace that may be concocted between Moscow and Washington, without Europe or Ukraine at the table?
This last idea should be the most troubling for European security and Ukrainian sovereignty. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia, denied that a draft deal discussed in March 2022 in Istanbul – a rushed peace bid which fell apart in the early stages of the war due to the massacres in Irpin of Ukrainian civilians – would be the framework. But he called it a “departure point, at least.”
These proposed accords demanded that Ukraine relinquish its ambitions to join NATO, an aim which is now enshrined in the country’s constitution. The draft deal also demanded major cultural changes, the least of which was Russian being made an official language.
But above all, it tried to set limits on the armed forces Ukraine could retain which would have made them significantly smaller than Russia’s vast military. Its essence was capitulation. Not in terms of submitting to peace. But in removing Ukraine’s ability to convincingly defend itself in the event that Russia, as Ukraine says it has done more than 20 times in the last decade, violates a ceasefire and attacks again.
The pressure being laid onto Ukraine would suggest Tuesday’s meeting in Riyadh – already extremely high stakes after the Oval Office catastrophe just over a week ago – is not intended to be a simple, glad-handing moment of making up. We may learn the kind of peace Trump envisions, and how much of that mirrors Moscow’s ambitions.
Europe’s future security depends on how much “art of the deal” there is in this deal. Trump’s accustomed business world is one where he would seek to make a purchase or a contract attractive to the other side. Perhaps he might fire the head of the subcontractor if the other side didn’t like them (hence the loose talk of Zelensky’s fitness for office). He might screw down on their terms to improve margins (pausing military aid). He might flatter his prospective client (his reluctance to speak ill of Putin).
But the deal would ultimately involve the purchase of bricks and mortar, or their construction: a simple and predictable future course of actions or change in ownership of property, protected and cosseted by lawyers and courts – by the rule of law. If the other side broke the deal, Trump could sue. The precedents and courses of action were well-defined, and the rule of law on his side in ensuring the terms of the deal were kept.
Russia is not a massive fan of the rule of law. It negotiates normally to buy time to pursue its military goals. It seized the eastern Ukrainian town of Debaltseve literally during the first days of a ceasefire in 2015, negotiated following its limited invasion of Ukraine the previous year. Putin was raised in the KGB, lives on a diet of “maskirovka” (masking) and openly denied it was his troops who invaded Crimea in 2014, before laughingly accepting they were actually his a few years later. Were he a business, his credit rating would probably be distressed.
But Trump’s belief, his hunch, that Putin can be trusted and wants peace, is now guiding US policy, and rewriting America’s role in the largest war in Europe since the 1940s.
Signs of the damage this psychological blow has inflicted are already bubbling to the surface. Ukrainian forces are in peril in the Kursk region, and may lose this sliver of Russian land that was their only territorial card at the negotiating table. If they fall, the North Korean and Russian troops engaged there can then turn their attention to the rest of the eastern frontline where Moscow has made slow progress for months.
Ballistic missile and drone attacks have caused a horrific loss of civilian life this weekend, even after Trump threatened sanctions for Moscow “pounding” Ukraine, and may worsen as the pause in military aid reduces the US-supplied Patriots that Ukraine has depended on for air defense for its cities.
So far, the collapse in American support for Ukraine has mostly been confined to wild theater in foreign capitals. This week, we may learn details of the unclear peace Trump seeks. And then the grim toll of these remote, sanitary hotel meetings in suits will likely turn into dust and loss across Ukraine.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/08/style/ukraine-art-artifacts-russia-war-cec/index.html,The hunt for Ukraine’s stolen artworks,2025-03-08 10:01:17,"For Ukrainians, more than three years into Russia’s full-scale invasion, the war isn’t just being fought in the trenches. It’s in the museums, and in the cultural heritage they seek to preserve.
Amid the continuing onslaught, the country’s historical centers — which, one could argue, hold the cultural identity of Ukraine — have struggled. Heritage sites have been damaged; museums have been looted; artifacts have been stolen. And these catastrophes aren’t random — legal experts and historians claim Russia intentionally targets artistic and cultural sites as a way to eradicate Ukrainian identity.
“Even if we have an advantage on the battlefield, but they destroy all our museums, burn all our books, will we be able to remain Ukrainian?” asked Halyna Chyzhyk, a legal expert working to protect Ukraine’s remaining cultural sites. “What will we have left?”
Politically, Ukraine has also seen its largest ally, the US, see-saw from backing its cause to diplomatically aligning with Russia, as US President Donald Trump attempts to rush a peace deal. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its offensive, launching its largest drone attack of the last three years on the eve of the war’s anniversary.
Still, Ukrainian art historians and museum directors are doing everything they can to retrieve stolen works and protect what remains.
As of January, UNESCO has verified damage to 476 cultural properties — ranging from cathedrals to museums, monuments and libraries. The Ukrainian Heritage Monitoring Lab puts the toll higher, telling CNN that in its 128 expeditions it has “reliably documented more than 1,200 damaged cultural heritage sites and cultural infrastructure” across the country. As Chyzhyk, and countless cultural industry experts have said, many sites have been directly targeted and destroyed by Russian forces, not just collateral damage.
Death-defying evacuations
As the war grinds on, historians and museum workers have begun taking evacuation measures into their own hands.
Historian Leonid Marushchak, co-founder of NGO Museum Open for Renovation, has evacuated almost 2 million artifacts — paintings, sculptures and so on — as Russian forces continue to target and desolate museums around the country.
Among the evacuated exhibits was a stone sculpture of a lion, which may be up to 1,000 years old. It was stored at a museum in Bakhmut, a town captured by Russians after heavy fighting that lasted for more than six months.
“I couldn’t sleep because of this lion,” Marushchak said. “When the city was almost destroyed and even museum walls were falling down, we went there to get that lion out.”
For many historians and museums, documenting the destruction is a significant part of the restoration process. Crimes have to be recorded while there are still traces of them, said Vasyl Rozhko, founder of the Ukrainian Heritage Monitoring Lab.
As an example, he used a church built in the 1860s in the northern village of Vyazivka, which sustained some damage in the attacks in 2022 and collapsed less than a year later. The team made a 3D model of the church, and later a laser scan. But while deciding how exactly to save the structure, the church collapsed. The only thing left was that 3D model, Rozhko said.
“Some objects can stand (after damage) but some cannot,” he added. “And if we don’t document and record them, we won’t even know what to save.”
For others, preservation looks a little different. At the Khanenko Museum in Kyiv, one of the biggest art museums in the country, director Yulia Vaganova and her team have determined that the only way to save the collection — comprised primarily of art from other Western European countries, not Ukraine — is to show it.
Sometimes, that means transferring the artwork to other museums in Europe. In 2023, for protection, Vaganova transferred 16 works to the Louvre, which briefly showcased five of them as an exhibit. At the Royal Castle in Warsaw, 37 works from the Khanenko are also on display.
“In the museum, we asked ourselves: What should we do? And who are we as a museum? What is our work during the war? And if we were just a storage facility, we would probably just have to close down,” Vaganova said. “But a museum is always broader than just preserving works.”
Show of support
Still, showcasing an exhibit is different now than before the invasion. Every two weeks, curators select one small item from the collection and show it for one day, before packing it up and moving it back to safety. For a museum housing 25,000 works, presenting just a single item is a downsize. But it also gives the curators a chance to highlight something that may have gone overlooked before the invasion. And the audience has responded.
“You can see how much people miss the collection. You can see how longingly and sometimes tenderly they appreciate that the museum is open, that they can come here,” Vaganova said. “There is a lot of support, warmth and tenderness in this, but also fragility.”
At any point, she explains, the museum can be targeted. Their collections are vulnerable, and the team may not be able to secure everything. Even for a museum of mostly international works, its existence is part of Ukrainian heritage, Vaganova said.
‘I sat on the floor in the empty storage rooms and cried’
Other museum bosses are still on a mission to retrieve tens of thousands of artifacts stolen early on in the full-scale invasion.
A few months before February 24, 2022, founder of the Kherson Art Museum Alina Dotsenko and her team happened to have packed away the site’s entire collection, to prepare for restoration work on the building.
But seven months later, in October 2022, a different kind of invasion occurred. Groups of museum workers from Russian-occupied Crimea found out about the hidden collection and loaded about 10,000 of the museum’s artifacts and works into trucks and drove them away.
Weeks later, after Kherson was liberated by the Ukrainian army, Dotsenko visited the once-full and methodized storage facilities. There were only empty racks left.
“I’m not touchy,” Dotsenko says, recalling the moment from years prior. “But I just slid down the wall, sat on the floor in the empty storage rooms, and just cried.”
Just like that, the Kherson museum’s once robust collection dwindled to just about 3,000 artifacts.
Dotsenko tracked down some of the works thanks to pictures from a journalist showing the same trucks unloading at a museum in Crimea. When Dotsenko and her team claimed theft, the Crimean museum said it was “trying to preserve the collection,” Dotsenko said.
Dotsenko still has the documents detailing the Kherson museum’s stock. Those records have allowed her and her team to uncover exactly what and how much was taken. They’ve hidden the remaining collection and helped open criminal cases for the rest, she said, but there’s little else she can do.
“We are working for this every day,” Dotsenko said. “And I don’t know how it will end.”
Such retrieval attempts aren’t just a way to preserve valuable history. In some ways, the aim is to preserve Ukraine itself.
In 2022, the historic home of Hryhorii Skovoroda — a famous Ukrainian poet and philosopher — was destroyed in a missile strike, along with the museum of his work. The home, located in a tiny village and not nearby any obvious military targets, has been considered an act of cultural vandalism.
Recalling that attack, Chyzhyk said these offenses are of “great symbolic importance.” The goal doesn’t seem to be any particular monument or structure, she said. Instead, the goal is seemingly destroying as many historical and cultural artifacts as possible, even the ones that only matter to small communities. Even if they can’t kill the people, Chyzhyk said, they can kill the very things that make them Ukrainian.
An impossible task
However, fully protecting any of the artwork is impossible, said Vaganova. You can’t just move a museum from the east, which borders Russia, to the west. There aren’t huge storage facilities; no bunkers with doors big enough for thousands of priceless art to be contained. Wherever you store the art, she said, it could still be bombed.
Even if a museum diligently evacuates its work, there can still be damage, added Rozhko. Some of them aren’t packed well or accounted for; there can also be deterioration.
“Often, such evacuation can be even more harmful than being in the occupied territory,” he said.
In short: There’s no correct answer; no handbook dictating the exact right way to preserve an entire country’s cultural history. If you hide the works, like Dotsenko, they can be found and stolen. If you evacuate them, they can be damaged. If you leave them, they could be destroyed.
“There is no right solution to this case at all. It simply does not exist,” said Vaganova. “And this is, of course, the nightmare of every museum director.”","['Leah Asmelash', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/07/world/russia-aerial-assault-ukraine-us-pause-military-aid-intl/index.html,Russia launches major aerial assault on Ukraine days after US shut off military aid,2025-03-07 00:00:00,"Russia fired cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine in a major overnight attack, Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday, as the Ukrainian president renewed his plea for a partial ceasefire at the end of a week in which the United States suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv.
Russia’s assault targeted several regions across Ukraine, using nearly 70 missiles and almost 200 drones, Zelensky said on X, adding that the “massive” attack was “directed against infrastructure that ensures normal life.”
Following the strikes, Zelensky again stressed his desire for a partial ceasefire – a plan first floated by French President Emmanuel Macron and since discussed by Ukraine’s European allies, who met Thursday in Brussels for a crucial European Union defense summit.
Echoing the plan outlined by Macron, Zelensky said he hoped there can be “silence in the skies – banning the use of missiles, long-range drones and aerial bombs,” as well as “silence at sea – a real guarantee of normal navigation.”
He added later Friday that “the most intensive work ever” is underway with US President Donald Trump’s team ahead of Zelensky’s visit to Saudi Arabia next week for negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.
But the Trump administration has dealt further blows to Ukraine this week, pausing military shipments to the country and cutting off intelligence sharing.
The White House also has suspended Ukraine’s access to commercial satellite imagery purchased by the US government through the company Maxar, spokespeople for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Maxar said Friday. Kyiv has long used this overhead imagery to track Russian troop movements, assess terrain and help in the planning of military operations.
After weeks of more amicable relations with Russia, Trump issued a surprising threat to Moscow on Friday, saying “based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine,” he is considering placing large-scale banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it agrees to a ceasefire and final peace settlement.
“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,” Trump said on TruthSocial.
But despite Trump’s harsh tone, the prospect of higher tariffs will mean little to Moscow, given the tiny amounts of trade between the US and Russia. Last year, Russia exported just $3.5 billion of goods to the US, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.
The halting of American military equipment may have devastating effects on Ukraine’s capabilities and could leave millions of civilians vulnerable to Russian missile strikes.
Russia’s overnight barrage included 43 cruise missiles, including eight Kalibr cruise missiles, as well as three Iskander ballistic missiles and 194 drones, according to Ukraine’s air force.
The air force said it downed 134 projectiles, including 25 of the cruise missiles, all eight Kalibr missiles, a guided aircraft missile and 100 drones – but it was unable to repel the ballistic missiles, which travel at about five times the speed of sound.
However, it was unable to repel the ballistic missiles, which travel at about five times the speed of sound. The only weapon in Ukraine’s arsenal capable of downing ballistic missiles is the US-made Patriot system, which were already in short supply before the US cut off military aid to Kyiv.
Zelensky said that F-16 fighter jets, as well as Mirage aircraft provided by France, had been used to help repel the attack, and that the Mirages had successfully intercepted some of the cruise missiles.
In the late hours of Friday, Russian strikes on the city of Dobropillia in eastern Ukraine killed at least five people and injured another 18, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, Vadym Filashkin, said in a Telegram post. Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa also endured a wave of drone attacks late on Friday, said the head of the Odesa region military administration Oleh Kiper.
Russia’s Defense Ministry meanwhile said its air defenses shot down 43 Ukrainian drones over several regions in a span of two and a half hours on Friday.
Over the week since Zelensky’s disastrous meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Ukrainian leader has tacked more closely to his European allies. Led by Macron, several European leaders are pushing for a one-month ceasefire that could pave the way for a more lasting peace.
“The first steps toward real peace must include forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks against life. And this is something that can be effectively monitored,” Zelensky said after the overnight attack.
Russian pressure in Kursk
Meanwhile, Ukraine is under severe pressure in Kursk and may soon lose a key logistical support route to its forces in the Russian region, according to Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers, after the arrival of fresh North Korean troops bolstered Russia’s offensive operations inside its own borders.
Ukraine launched a shock incursion into Kursk in August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – in the hope that it could divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and improve its hand ahead of potential ceasefire negotiations.
Although the invasion may have slowed Russia’s offensive in Ukraine, Kyiv has since lost about half of the territory it once occupied in Kursk, after Moscow called in foreign reinforcements and deployed some 12,000 North Korean troops to the region.
This week, military bloggers from both countries have warned that Ukraine’s hold on the territory is more tenuous than at any point since it launched the incursion, with Moscow’s forces entering Ukraine’s Sumy region and threatening to cut off Kyiv’s troops in Kursk.
“The situation in the Kursk sector is very difficult – Russian troops have entered Sumy region,” Andriy Tsaplienko, a prominent Ukrainian military blogger, wrote on Telegram on Friday.
Tsaplienko warned that “Russian troops are rushing towards the road to Sudzha,” a major town in Kursk, in order to “cut off the Ukrainian bridgehead.” He added that Russia is “also trying to reach Zhuravka,” a village in Ukraine’s Sumy region just a few hundred meters from the Russia-Ukraine border.
In a major report last month, the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, estimated that Ukraine has at most 30,000 troops stationed in the region, while Russia has gathered around 78,000 troops, including the North Koreans.
One Russian military blogger suggested that Moscow’s gains could be tied to the United States’ decision this week to pause intelligence sharing with Ukraine’s military.
“The breakthrough in Kursk regions… occurred exactly two days after the Americans stopped issuing target designations for cruise missiles and missiles of the ‘HIMARS’ system on the territory of Kursk region,” Yuriy Podolyka wrote on Telegram.
In the face of Russia’s gains, some Ukrainian bloggers have suggested that the Kursk incursion may have exhausted its strategic value.
“I didn’t think I would ever say this. But maybe it’s time to ‘close the shop’ from the Kursk direction. It’s hard for our guys there,” said Serhii Flesh. “As a diversion of enemy resources, I think this operation has long since justified itself. As a political bargaining card, it is now questionable.”","['Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'Christian Edwards']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/07/europe/europe-security-urkraine-defense-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,Europe scrambles to rearm as Trump threatens security guarantees and Russian threat looms. Here’s what to know,2025-03-07 05:55:48,"European leaders have vowed to rearm the continent at historic emergency talks held after the United States threatened to rip up 80 years of security guarantees over the trajectory of Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Since taking office in January, US President Donald Trump has fundamentally changed transatlantic relations, suspended all military aid and intelligence sharing to Kyiv and again cast doubt that the US would defend its NATO allies if attacked.
With Russia posing what French President Emmanual Macron called an “existential threat” to Europe, the continent is now scrambling to prepare for the once-unthinkable prospect of defending itself in a potential future conflict without the help of America.
And as the European Union leaders push for Ukraine and Europe to heard in peace talks, they were joined by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on Thursday.
Zelensky announced he will visit Saudi Arabia next week to present an initial ceasefire plan ahead of talks between Kyiv and Washington, following his unprecedented televised argument with Trump in the White House last week.
Here’s what to know:
Billions in defense spending
At an extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Brussels, the EU leaders agreed to plans that could free up billions of euros to ensure Europe’s security, boost defense spending, and shore up support for Kyiv.
The EU’s executive arm presented leaders with a proposal that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($862 billion) to bolster defense on the continent.
Part of the rearmament plan would provide countries with loans totaling up to 150 billion euros ($162 billion).
European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen called it a “watershed moment” for Europe and said detailed legal proposals will be studied ahead of another meeting at the end of the month.
A senior EU official told CNN they expect the bloc’s leaders to give a green light allowing the defense plan to be moved “forward very swiftly.”
Macron also announced the EU will give Ukraine more than $33 billion in assistance, taken from Russians sanctioned by Europe. “In 2025, the EU will provide Ukraine with 30.6 billion euros, financed by Russian assets,” Macron said.
The leaders said that Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine constituted an “existential challenge for the European Union,” and that Europe must become “more sovereign, more responsible for its own defense and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats.”
Alarm over Article 5
A joint declaration from the NATO leaders’ summit in Washinton, DC last year, stated that “Russia remains the most significant and direct threat to NATO security.” In the eyes of his allies, Trump is throwing that central theme to the wind.
On Thursday, Trump again suggested the US may abandon its commitments to the security alliance – a key bedrock of Western security against the risk of a Russian attack – saying that member countries were not spending enough on defense.
“I think it’s common sense. If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trump said.
At the core of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty is the promise of collective defense — that an attack on one member nation is an attack on all.
Trump has long complained about the amount NATO members spend on defense compared with the US.
But his comments could raise alarm around the world, coming as the US changes its position on the Ukraine war, and amid accusations the Trump administration is aligning with Russia over its allies.
“We see now the White House takes steps towards the Kremlin, trying to meet them half way, so the next target of Russia could be Europe,” Kyiv’s ambassador to the United Kingdom Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Thursday. He added that the US is “destroying” the current world order.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Thursday emphasized the importance of the US’ commitment to NATO, saying, “Let me be clear, the Transatlantic relationship and the Transatlantic partnership remains the bedrock of our Alliance.”
A peace deal with Europe’s involvement
As European leaders voiced near-unanimous support for Ukraine, European Commission President Von der Leyen warned that negotiations for peace would only be possible with Europe’s support.
Of the 27 EU leaders present in Brussels, all but one signed a text calling for a peace deal that respects “Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” while including Ukraine in the negotiations. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban abstained.
France’s Macron had outlined a plan for a one-month “air, sea and energy infrastructure” ceasefire in Ukraine, which could pave the way for a more lasting peace deal.
But he warned that allies “must avoid a ceasefire that is discussed in haste.”
And Ukraine withdrawing its NATO bid without a security guarantee as a condition of any ceasefire is “obviously unacceptable,” he added.
Zelensky said he is “preparing practical proposals” to end the war with European leaders. The first step would be for Russia to stop airstrikes on energy and civilian infrastructure and halt “all military operations in the Black Sea,” Zelensky posted on X.
The Ukrainian president will meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia next week, and his team will stay in the country “to work with our American partners,” he said.
The UK and Turkey, two NATO allies and key backers of Ukraine – but not EU members – were not present at the summit. Britain’s leader Keir Starmer has said he is ready to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help keep any truce agreed between Kyiv and Moscow.
Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry, rejected the one-month ceasefire proposal, and said the idea of European peacekeeping troops being deployed in Ukraine would be “unacceptable.”
The ministry said the “normalization” of the Russia-US relationship is “causing panic” in Europe.
Meanwhile, China’s special envoy for European Affairs Lu Shaye said he hopes Europe can be stirred by the “Trump administration’s aggressive and domineering policies toward Europe” to “at least reflect on some of their past policies toward China.”",['Helen Regan'],en

At the summit in Brussels, 26 European leaders signed a text calling for a peace deal that respects “Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” while including Ukraine in the negotiations. Hungary abstained.
In a separate text, all 27 leaders of Europe greenlit proposals that could free up billions of euros to boost defense spending, calling on the European Commission to find new ways to “facilitate significant defense spending at national level in all Member States.”
Leaders noted a proposal from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that would provide countries with loans totaling up to 150 billion euros ($162 billion) and said the plan would be studied ahead of another meeting at the end of the month.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky attended Thursday’s special session, and thanked the leaders of the European Union (EU) for supporting him as his relationship with US President Donald Trump disintegrated over recent days.
“During all (of) this period, and last week, you stayed with us,” Zelensky said at the meeting. “From all the Ukrainians, from all our nation: big appreciation. We are very thankful that we are not alone.”
Following the Special European Council summit in Brussels, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Thursday that the EU will give Ukraine over $33 billion in assistance, taken from Russians sanctioned by the EU.
“The priority is to support Ukraine and its army in the very short term,” Macron said. “In 2025, the EU will provide Ukraine with 30.6 billion euros, financed by Russian assets.”
In Washington meanwhile, Trump reiterated his criticism of unequal defense spending among NATO countries. “I think it’s common sense. If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trump said.
Heads of the 27 EU nations had traveled to Brussels to find a path forward in the conflict; the latest in a string of sessions aimed at finding a ceasefire deal with Ukraine’s support before the US and Russia force one on Kyiv. But some fear that the involvement of ambivalent countries could derail efforts to put together a peace plan which might satisfy both Kyiv and Washington. And there is uncertainty across Europe that Trump would even be interested in any plan the continent presents him with.
Asked about how Europe can convince the US to include them in negotiations over the war in Ukraine, von der Leyen said that all parties want “peace from a position of strength.”
“This is also in the interest of President Trump, to have a peaceful strength, and if he wants to achieve this, it is only possible with the support of the European Union and its member states, because pre-conditions have to be met,” she said.
A ‘new era’
Europe is “entering a new era,” Macron admitted in a televised address on Wednesday night, describing an increased weariness over the shift in Trump’s tone toward Moscow.
“The United States, our ally, has changed its position on this war, is less supportive of Ukraine and is casting doubt on what will happen next,” Macron warned.
And Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who was dismissed as Ukraine’s military chief last year in a major shakeup before becoming Kyiv’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, said in unusually blunt and potentially incendiary remarks that the US is “destroying” the current world order.
“We see now the White House takes steps towards the Kremlin, trying to meet them half way, so the next target of Russia could be Europe,” he said at London think tank Chatham House on Thursday. “It’s not just the ‘axis of evil’ and Russia trying to revise the world order, but the US is finally destroying this order.”
Hungary was the only country whose leader refused to sign Thursday’s Ukraine text at the summit, though Prime Minister Viktor Orban did agree to the statement on defense. By doing so, Hungary “isolated” itself from the consensus of Europe, European Council President Antonio Costa said in a statement to press after the meeting.
A meeting with a key difference
Thursday was the third hastily organized European meeting over the future of the war since the Trump administration dramatically pulled back its support for the continent.
A Sunday summit in London saw some progress: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said a small group of European nations would work with Zelensky on a ceasefire proposal, then present it to the US – a workaround that might avert another meltdown in relations between Trump and Zelensky.
But this meeting had a key difference: It involves every nation in the bloc, not just the countries who opted to attend Starmer’s summit. And some countries are neither willing nor interested in supporting Ukraine’s fight for survival.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly resisted calls to support Kyiv militarily. Unlike most of his European counterparts, he supported Trump following the president’s argument with Zelensky, writing on X: “Strong men make peace, weak men make war.”
The Ukrainian leader said on Telegram Wednesday that Kyiv and Europe “are preparing a plan for the first steps to bring about a just and sustainable peace. We are working on it quickly. It will be ready soon.”
As talks gather to talk peace, Russia continues assaulting Ukraine on daily basis.
Zelensky arrived to Brussels just hours after the latest wave of Russian drone and missile attacks targeted his home town of Kryvyi Rih. A strike against a hotel in the southeastern city killed four people and injured many more, the president said early Thursday, adding that foreign citizens including Americans and Britons were among those staying at the hotel.
Sharing the burden
A senior EU diplomat told CNN that discussions around burden sharing are likely to feature heavily in Thursday’s summit, stressing that the burden for Ukraine’s aid needs to be “shared more evenly” between member states.
Reaching an agreement on that will prove difficult. Without singling any countries out, the diplomat highlighted how the countries that aren’t paying their “fair share” when it comes to Ukraine are also usually failing to spend over 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.
Some serious progress is nonetheless expected. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a plan to rearm Europe in the build-up to the summit, and said the bloc could mobilize funds up to 800 billion euros ($862 billion) to achieve it. “We are in an era of rearmament,” she said in a statement Wednesday.
“The question is no longer whether Europe’s security is threatened in a very real way,” she added. “Or whether Europe should shoulder more of the responsibility for its own security. In truth, we have long known the answers to those questions.”
A senior EU official told CNN that they expect EU leaders to give a green light allowing von der Leyen’s defense plan to be moved “forward very swiftly.”
There are immediate discussions taking place too: including on what the peacekeeping force deployed to Ukraine to uphold a potential ceasefire might look like. First proposed just two weeks ago, the force has quickly morphed from an idea to an apparent condition of any deal.
The UK, France and Turkey would likely contribute the bulk of any such force, a European official familiar with the negotiations told CNN in the build-up to the summit.
But the official said Eastern European states that neighbor Russia were concerned that contributing to the force might leave their own borders vulnerable – a fear that Poland has been particularly open about since it was first raised.
“European NATO has about 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) of eastern border, so you don’t want to empty the eastern border,” the official said. “Most likely the boots on the ground, if there is to be such a component, will not come from countries like Finland or Poland who are frontline countries already and need to keep the boots on their own ground.”
The official said it was a “reasonable assumption” that most of the troops would come from Britain, France and Turkey.
The official said a timeline for confidence-building measures was under discussion, but said it might prove “challenging” for a limited ceasefire in Ukraine and prisoner swaps to begin by Easter. Agreeing and implementing a full-blown ceasefire across the whole front line in that timeframe would be “completely unrealistic,” they added.","['Rob Picheta', 'Niamh Kennedy']",en

Across state-controlled Russian media, disparaging references to “the collective West” and “Anglo-Saxons” – thinly-veiled diplomatic code for US-led states – have been quietly dropped. Instead, it’s just what the Kremlin calls “the old world” of Europe, without its US partner, being singled out for criticism.
On his top-rated news show, Dmitry Kisylov, a prominent state mouthpiece who once boasted how Russia could reduce the United States to a smouldering pile of radioactive ash, is now talking about a “great troika,” dominating the globe: China, Russia and the US.
“Now the European war party wants to further escalate the Ukrainian conflict,” Kisylov tells his millions of Russian viewers.
But “if we simplify it, everything now is decided by the great troika - Russia, China and US - that will form the new structure of the world. The European Union as a single political force no longer exists,” he adds.
It is a bleak vision already being played out on the battlefields of Ukraine, where the Trump-administration, determined to end the bloodshed, is piling pressure on an embattled Kyiv.
To the alarm of the Western allies, US President Donald Trump has made breathtaking concessions to the Kremlin, most recently suspending US military aid to Ukraine – to the glee of the Kremlin. Trump has also rejected the idea of future NATO membership for the country, which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022, and have US security guarantees.
By unilaterally starting negotiations with Russia over the heads of Ukraine and Europe, Trump has begun a controversial process of bringing Moscow in from the diplomatic cold, sowing disunity among Washington’s traditional allies. Both are longtime Kremlin objectives.
Trump’s public humiliation of Ukrainian President Zelensky during a recent visit to the White House underlined for many Russians just how seismic the US shift has been.
At times, Kremlin-controlled media struggled to reconcile the shocking events.
“On the one hand, Trump speaks about peace, and politicians close to him say they’re interested in Ukraine’s success,” observed Igor Naymushin, a reporter for Russian state media.
“But on the other, from Washington it looks like he’s giving Russia all the cards and tools to successfully continue the special military operation and directly achieve success on the battlefield,” Naymushin added, using a common euphemism in Russia for its actions in Ukraine.
In Russia, the heavily-controlled media reflects the mood of the Kremlin, as do the words of Russian officials now driving home US-European divisions while flip-flopping on Washington’s historical record.
“I do not want to be anti-European,” claimed Sergey Lavrov, the veteran Russian foreign minister. “However…. all the tragedies of the world originated in Europe or happened thanks to European policy. Colonization, wars, crusaders, the Crimean War, Napoleon, World War One, Adolf Hitler. If we look at history in retrospect, the Americans did not play any instigating or even inflammatory role,” he insisted in an interview posted on the official foreign ministry website.
Beyond the flattery, however, it’s hard to see what the US has extracted from Russia in return for Washington’s geopolitical about-face.
Privately, one Russian official told me the US-Russian economic cooperation deals being discussed behind closed doors may have appealed. Such deals are Putin’s “Kryptonite” for a transactional Trump, as one Russian commentator put it.
“Trump is like Superman, and our President (Putin) has found his weakness,” said Nikita Danyuk, a member of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation to Russian state media outlet Channel 1.
“As soon as Trump hears ‘rare earth metals’, it doesn’t matter if those metals are there or not. He forgets about anything and is ready to accept any terms. It’s truly a grandmasters game by our President,” Danyuk said.
Other pro-Kremlin figures, like Olga Skabaeva, a state TV presenter, highlight the free hand the Trump administration appears to have granted Moscow.
After a senior Ukrainian official, Andrey Yermak, posted a social media calling for Russia to “stop its daily shelling of Ukraine, and immediately, if it really wants to end the war,” Skabaeva responded: “This morning Yermak woke up and thought he was Trump…”
“But he forgot that Trump does not set any conditions for Russia and Putin. Only for Zelensky and Ukraine.”
Little wonder the Kremlin’s propagandists have been falling over themselves to praise the United States.

Beyond the flattery, however, it’s hard to see what the US has extracted from Russia in return for Washington’s geopolitical about-face.
Privately, one Russian official told me the US-Russian economic cooperation deals being discussed behind closed doors may have appealed. Such deals are Putin’s “Kryptonite” for a transactional Trump, as one Russian commentator put it.
“Trump is like Superman, and our President (Putin) has found his weakness,” said Nikita Danyuk, a member of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation to Russian state media outlet Channel 1.
“As soon as Trump hears ‘rare earth metals’, it doesn’t matter if those metals are there or not. He forgets about anything and is ready to accept any terms. It’s truly a grandmasters game by our President,” Danyuk said.
Other pro-Kremlin figures, like Olga Skabaeva, a state TV presenter, highlight the free hand the Trump administration appears to have granted Moscow.
After a senior Ukrainian official, Andrey Yermak, posted a social media calling for Russia to “stop its daily shelling of Ukraine, and immediately, if it really wants to end the war,” Skabaeva responded: “This morning Yermak woke up and thought he was Trump…”
“But he forgot that Trump does not set any conditions for Russia and Putin. Only for Zelensky and Ukraine.”
Little wonder the Kremlin’s propagandists have been falling over themselves to praise the United States.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/politics/kellogg-trump-ukraine-envoy-intelligence-pause/index.html,Trump’s Ukraine envoy says Kyiv brought the pause in US intelligence sharing ‘on themselves’,2025-03-06 17:18:51,"The Trump administration’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia said Thursday that Ukraine “brought it on themselves” in regard to the cutoff of intelligence sharing from the US.
“That’s a pretty major concession to Russia, to constrain Ukraine’s ability to target and hit Russian forces,” CBS’ Margaret Brennan, who was moderating the conversation with Keith Kellogg at the Council on Foreign Relations, said of the cutoff on intelligence sharing. “This pressure really seems to be directly impacting potentially what they can do on the battlefield.”
“Very candidly, they brought it on themselves, the Ukrainians,” Kellogg said.
CNN reported Wednesday that the Trump administration ordered at least a partial halt of intelligence sharing that was assisting Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. The administration has also paused shipping military aid to Kyiv following the deterioration of the relationship between the US and Ukraine, which was clearly on display in the heated argument in the Oval Office last week between President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The cut-off of American military equipment will likely have devastating effects on Ukraine’s capabilities on the battlefield, and could leave civilians in Ukrainian cities vulnerable to Russian strikes.
Asked what Ukraine will have to do to turn intelligence sharing and flow of military aid back on, Kellogg pointed to the proposed minerals deal between the US and Ukraine.
“The reason he came to the White House was to sign a document that was going to say this is us going forward — it’s not signed,” Kellogg said of Zelensky. “My point would be, and my personal belief would be, you don’t move forward until you get a signed document. Period.”
“But he’s offering is offering to do it,” Brennan said. “He is offering publicly at least to do it.”
“There’s a difference between offering to do it and doing it,” Kellogg replied.
“By the way this is not something that is unusual. When I was in Kyiv two weeks ago, I was very clear to President Zelensky the outcome if we didn’t have a signed agreement,” Kellogg later added. “I was absolutely— I was blunt, and clear, that this was a thing that could have happened.”
Asked during the CFR event what the impact of turning off intelligence sharing and military aid will have, Kellogg said, “The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a 2x4 across the nose, you got their attention.” He gave another example in which he compared talking to Ukraine how his two granddaughters try to get his attention when he strays in a conversation, by grabbing his face and telling him, “Pop Pop, listen to me.”
“We’re going to end this war, and this is one way to make sure you understand we’re serious about it,” Kellogg said Thursday. “So is it hard, of course it is, but it’s not like they didn’t know this was coming. They got fair warning it was coming.”",['Haley Britzky'],en

Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who was dismissed as Ukraine’s military chief last year in a major shake up before taking up the diplomatic post and is seen as a possible presidential candidate, also cautioned against the US trying to meet Russia “half way.”
In the wake of the angry exchange in Washington DC, the US halted military aid to Ukraine and paused intelligence sharing, underscoring fears in Kyiv that the Trump administration was swinging behind Russia.
“It’s not just the ‘axis of evil’ and Russia trying to revise the world order, but the US is finally destroying this order,” Zaluzhnyi said, speaking on a panel at British think tank Chatham House on Thursday.
Zaluzhnyi said that the US government had “questioned” the unity of the Western world, with the Trump administration opening talks with Russia, sidelining Ukraine and Europe.
“Now Washington is trying to delegate the security issues to Europe without participation of the US,” he said.
He cast doubt over the future of the NATO military alliance, saying; “We can say that in the near future NATO likewise could stop existing.”
“We see now the White House takes steps towards the Kremlin, trying to meet them half way, so the next target of Russia could be Europe,” he added.
His words come as Europe has been scrambling to sure up its defense capabilities after Donald Trump’s dramatic reversal of US policies sparked fears that Europe may not be able to rely on American support amid the ever-present threat from Russia.
Ukraine’s European allies have rallied around Zelensky following the showdown between him and Trump in the Oval Office, which culminated in the Ukrainian leader being thrown out of the White House.
Since then, Zelensky has sought to ease tensions with the Trump administration, saying that the fiery meeting “did not go the way it was supposed to,” describing it as “regrettable” and noting that Ukraine is ready to negotiate about an end to the conflict.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/europe/macron-france-nuclear-arsenal-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html,Macron says France to consider protecting European allies with its nuclear arsenal,2025-03-05 00:00:00,"France will consider extending the protection of its nuclear arsenal to its allies, French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday, while warning that Europe needs to be ready for the United States to not “remain by our side” in the Ukraine-Russia war.
“I’ve decided to open the strategic debate on the protection by our deterrence of our allies on the European continent,” he said in a live broadcast on his official social media channels, during which he stressed the need for Europe to continue assisting Ukraine and strengthen its own defense.
“Our nuclear deterrence protects us, it is complete, sovereign, French from end to end,” Macron said of France’s nuclear arsenal. “This protects us much more than many of our neighbors.”
“Whatever happens, the decision has always remained and will remain in the hands of the president of the Republic, commander of the military,” Macron added.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Macron of posing a direct threat to Russia with his rhetoric.
“If he considers us a threat, he calls a meeting of the chiefs of general staff of European countries and Britain, says that it is necessary to use nuclear weapons, prepares to use nuclear weapons against Russia, this is, of course, a threat,” Lavrov said at a news conference on Thursday.
Macron also warned that Europe was “entering a new era,” and that it would be “folly” to remain a “spectator” to the threat from Russia.
“The United States, our ally, has changed its position on this war, is less supportive of Ukraine and is casting doubt on what will happen next,” Macron said, adding: “I want to believe that the United States will remain by our side, but we need to be ready if that were not the case.”
Although France remains committed to both NATO and its partnership to the US, it needs to “do more” to strengthen its own “independence in matters of defense and security,” Macron said.
He announced he would invite European leaders to a meeting in Paris next week to work on a plan to deliver a “durable peace,” which may include deploying peacekeeping troops to Ukraine “once peace has been signed” to prevent Russia from re-invading.
His comments come after Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, advocated for talks with France and the United Kingdom - Europe’s two nuclear powers - to extend their nuclear protection.
But the current German chancellor Olaf Scholz urged for a “calm and wise approach,” telling reporters in Brussels on Thursday that Europe should not give up on US involvement in nuclear deterrent support.
“We are joined together with each other in NATO. There are very specific rules on this and what is particularly important is what we have in terms of nuclear sharing, which is organized in Germany. I believe that this should not be given up, that is the common view of all central parties in Germany,” Scholz said.
Macron has nodded to the idea before, telling Portuguese TV station RTP last month: “If my [fellow European leaders] want to proceed towards greater autonomy and a capacity for deterrence, well we must open that discussion.”
And on Monday, he told French newspaper Le Parisien, in comments confirmed to CNN by the Elysee Palace, that “Europeans who wish to deepen dialogue with us [on the question of nuclear deterrence] could … be involved with [the French military’s] deterrence exercises.”
The Wednesday speech came days after Macron met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a critical summit, following the disastrous show-down between Zelensky and US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.","['Joseph Ataman', 'Jessie Yeung']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/europe/analysis-ukraine-russia-security-guarantees-intl-latam/index.html,Ukraine wants security guarantees from the US and Europe. But will anyone step up?,2025-03-05 20:55:39,"Security guarantees. It’s the phrase Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky used countless times during an explosive clash with US President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance at the White House last week – and since.
How can Ukraine be assured that Russian President Vladimir Putin would abide by any ceasefire deal – and not resume fighting in a year or two, Zelensky asks. And how can Ukraine be protected from the unyielding ambitions of its more powerful neighbor?
Trump has been openly dismissive of Zelensky’s preoccupation with such guarantees. “Security is so easy, that’s about 2% of the problem,” he said during Friday’s Oval Office showdown.
Trump’s answers to the wider issue of Ukrainian security have been vague, beyond claiming the Europeans will handle it and that there’ll be no need for a US backstop.
“It should not be that hard a deal to make,” Trump said Monday, hours before he announced a pause in shipments of US military aid to Ukraine.
He also suggested that the presence of American companies exploiting Ukraine’s rare-earths and other minerals would be enough to keep Russia at bay. “I don’t think anybody’s going to play around if we’re there with a lot of workers,” he said.
There were plenty of US companies operating in Ukraine on the day before Russia’s full-scale invasion of 2022.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio might have a more realistic take. In a Fox News interview last week, he said that “what Ukraine really needs is a deterrent … to make it costly for anyone to come after them again in the future.” He added that this “doesn’t have to just be America. I mean, the Europeans can be involved in that.”
Other US officials have said the US won’t be part of that deterrence. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said European troops in Ukraine would not enjoy protection under NATO’s principle of collective security. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has said the matter of security guarantees is “squarely going to be with the Europeans.”
A Ukrainian DMZ?
European leaders met in London on Sunday to begin to search for some answers for Ukraine as well as longer-term solutions to the unravelling of transatlantic relations.
“This is a once-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, calling for a “coalition of the willing.”
“Europe knows one thing: the deal, if it happens, is not simply about carving up Ukraine or securing a quick ceasefire … it is about a lasting and secure peace agreement, about existential security issues for all of Europe,” Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington, wrote in Foreign Affairs.
But Claudia Major and Aldo Kleemann at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs said in a recently published paper that the Europeans “lack both the necessary military capabilities and the political will and unity” to shoulder the burden.
French President Emmanuel Macron optimistically suggested negotiations would take “several weeks and then, once peace is signed, a (troop) deployment.” The deployment would have to be agreed with Russia.
Macron acknowledged, however, that a truce along the 1,000-kilometer (6,200 mile) front line would be “very difficult” to enforce. Peacekeepers would have to operate in a landscape of forests, fields and the wreckage of industrial towns, surrounded on three sides in some areas, with poor or non-existent roads.
The UK and France have expressed a willingness to be part of a post-conflict force to maintain the peace. Australia has also said that it is open to discussing a role.
But the response of other Europeans has been underwhelming. Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it “will require an effort that many are not yet really sufficiently prepared for.” Other allies evaded questions about their readiness to join a peacekeeping mandate. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that deploying Italian troops “has never been on the table.”
Starmer says other countries are ready to contribute but has not identified them. But the UK prime minister also said that the “effort must have strong US backing,” which is far from assured.
Estimates for the size of this proposed force vary as wildly as ideas for its mission and powers. Is it a small tripwire force that deters because it is backed by a more robust response to any violation? Is it a fully equipped mission able to defend itself?
A UN force is unlikely because “Russia, as a concerned state and permanent member of the UN Security Council, would have to agree to a deployment,” Major and Kleemann wrote in a paper, yet to be published and shared with CNN.
But they warn that “a ‘bluff and pray’ approach that deploys too few troops and relies essentially on the hope that Russia will not test it would be irresponsible.”
Zelensky pressed the same point in London over the weekend, insisting on the need for “very specific security guarantees and with very specific providers of these (guarantees)” that would make “100% impossible any kind of opportunity for Russia to come with another aggression.”
A full-fledged peacekeeping force would need to be at least 100,000-strong, an overwhelming commitment for European armies alone, especially when necessary rotations are included. By comparison, the peacekeeping mission that began in Kosovo in 1999 had 48,000 soldiers. Ukraine is more than 50 times the size of Kosovo.
Analysts also say that such a force would require a substantial demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the combatants and a constant liaison with both sides to handle violations.
There would need to be a Line of Control and the withdrawal of heavy weapons to a minimum distance of 40 kilometers (around 25 miles), they say. And neither side could fly drones in the DMZ.
There is also the issue of drones. Intervening in a conflict where drones and missiles have changed the nature of warfare, the peacekeeping force would require “electronic warfare, counter-drone and counter-intelligence capabilities,” Mick Ryan, the author of the blog Futura Doctrina, said.
There are countless escalation risks, too. If Russian forces were to drop long-range shells on an outpost of French or British soldiers, would that put NATO states at war with Russia? That might even be tempting for the Kremlin. If it targeted European troops near Ukraine’s front lines, NATO’s European members might find themselves at war with Russia without US support.
Meanwhile, a lightly policed ceasefire is unlikely to cut it.
“At best, a highly unstable situation would obtain, where a renewal of hostilities would be easily possible or even likely,” Marc Weller, a professor of international law at the Cambridge Initiative for Peace Settlements, said.
The best-case scenario
Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven, told CNN that realistic security guarantees involve three components: a substantial international presence on the ground, US backing, and a modernized and enlarged Ukrainian army.
Up to 100,000 peacekeepers, alongside a Ukrainian land force of some 200,000 soldiers, might suffice as a deterrent, he said. That would amount to roughly one-third of the Russian force deployed in or around Ukraine.
Starmer insisted that the “effort must have strong US backing.”
Even a well-equipped peacekeeping force would require US airlift capabilities, satellite coverage and missile defenses to deter fresh Russian offensives, all assets the Europeans lack.
Zelensky asserts that the “best security guarantee is a strong Ukrainian army and a strong Ukrainian army that has enough numbers.”
Ukrainian capabilities would also have to include longer-range Western missiles that would allow Ukraine to go after Russian supply lines and logistics hubs, as well as far more potent air power, in the event hostilities resume.
But unless the Kremlin is forced to negotiate, this is all a pipedream. The Russian Foreign Ministry has already said that the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine, whether under the Alliance banner or not, would be “categorically unacceptable.”
Official Russian news agency RIA Novosti quoted the Foreign Intelligence Service on Tuesday as saying that a force of 100,000 peacekeepers “would amount to the de facto occupation of Ukraine.”
Russia “has made maximalist demands and will prove very difficult to budge,” Ischinger wrote. “It is an illusion to believe that a durable peace with Russia will break out simply by enshrining the line of contact in eastern Ukraine.”
Russia’s upper hand?
By Putin’s theory of war, Russia is winning. It’s making incremental gains that may be accelerated if Ukraine loses critical US military hardware. The Institute for the Study of War said Putin’s priorities are to “prevent Ukraine from acquiring and sustaining the manpower and materiel needed to stop gradual but continued Russian advances.”
With Trump in the White House, the Kremlin sees Zelensky as isolated, and the Europeans as left to fend for themselves. Russia has no incentive to compromise on its demands, which include possession of all four eastern regions of Ukraine that have been illegally annexed (even if Russia doesn’t occupy all of them); strict limits on the size and capabilities of the Ukrainian military; and Ukrainian neutrality.
“Ukraine should adopt a neutral, nonaligned status, be nuclear-free, and undergo demilitarization and denazification,” Putin told an audience last summer. By Moscow’s logic, Zelensky must go, because Russia cannot sign a deal with an “illegitimate” leader.
When push comes to shove, would the Trump administration turn the screws on the Kremlin? Trump and other senior US officials have said that Russia will be expected to make concessions, without providing details.
Under international law, recognition of Moscow’s rule over the four eastern regions of Ukraine would break every precedent, so the territorial question would have to be deferred, as has been the case in the Korean Peninsula for more than 60 years.
‘Steel porcupine’
As the Trump administration indicates that a defense review will lead to an eventual reduction of the American military footprint in Europe, and in the wake of its decision to pause military aid to Ukraine, all eyes are on European leaders’ next moves.
Europe can only contribute to the security guarantees that Ukraine needs through developing its own defense identity, combining joint research, production and training. This will not happen overnight, but steps to resuscitate Europe’s defense industries are already underway. Now they need to be turbo-charged.
The European Commission has been bullish about developing a fund for the defense industries, and on Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed allowing EU countries to draw up to €150 billion in loans and unlocking up to €800 billion of additional defense spending over the coming years.
She said EU members could “pool demand and to buy together and, of course, with this equipment, member states can massively step up their support to Ukraine.” The goal: to turn Ukraine into a “steel porcupine” that proves “indigestible for future invaders.”
Looming over any prospect of a ceasefire deal, however, is the question of Russia’s long-term intentions – whatever the Kremlin might publicly agree to.
The 1994 Budapest Memorandum included an assurance that Russia, along with the UK and the US, would “respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine” in return for Ukraine giving up Soviet-era nuclear weapons it had inherited.
Moscow repeatedly undermined the Minsk process designed to resolve the status of territories in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region that were seized in 2014-15 by pro-Russian militia. Putin persistently insisted Russia had no intention of invading Ukraine, until it did.
Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko recalled Monday how the ceasefire deal for Donbas signed by Russia in Paris in 2019 was violated by Moscow within weeks.
“Then, on February 18, 2020, Russians launched one of the largest assaults of the war. This is the Kremlin’s pattern: deception, false promises, and escalation,” Svyrydenko said.
More than Zelensky’s demands for security guarantees, that pattern is the greatest obstacle to peace.",['Tim Lister'],en

The Institute for the Study of War said Putin’s priorities are to “prevent Ukraine from acquiring and sustaining the manpower and materiel needed to stop gradual but continued Russian advances.”
With Trump in the White House, the Kremlin sees Zelensky as isolated, and the Europeans as left to fend for themselves. Russia has no incentive to compromise on its demands, which include possession of all four eastern regions of Ukraine that have been illegally annexed (even if Russia doesn’t occupy all of them); strict limits on the size and capabilities of the Ukrainian military; and Ukrainian neutrality.
“Ukraine should adopt a neutral, nonaligned status, be nuclear-free, and undergo demilitarization and denazification,” Putin told an audience last summer. By Moscow’s logic, Zelensky must go, because Russia cannot sign a deal with an “illegitimate” leader.
When push comes to shove, would the Trump administration turn the screws on the Kremlin? Trump and other senior US officials have said that Russia will be expected to make concessions, without providing details.
Under international law, recognition of Moscow’s rule over the four eastern regions of Ukraine would break every precedent, so the territorial question would have to be deferred, as has been the case in the Korean Peninsula for more than 60 years.
‘Steel porcupine’
As the Trump administration indicates that a defense review will lead to an eventual reduction of the American military footprint in Europe, and in the wake of its decision to pause military aid to Ukraine, all eyes are on European leaders’ next moves.
Europe can only contribute to the security guarantees that Ukraine needs through developing its own defense identity, combining joint research, production and training. This will not happen overnight, but steps to resuscitate Europe’s defense industries are already underway. Now they need to be turbo-charged.
The European Commission has been bullish about developing a fund for the defense industries, and on Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed allowing EU countries to draw up to €150 billion in loans and unlocking up to €800 billion of additional defense spending over the coming years.
She said EU members could “pool demand and to buy together and, of course, with this equipment, member states can massively step up their support to Ukraine.” The goal: to turn Ukraine into a “steel porcupine” that proves “indigestible for future invaders.”
Looming over any prospect of a ceasefire deal, however, is the question of Russia’s long-term intentions – whatever the Kremlin might publicly agree to.
The 1994 Budapest Memorandum included an assurance that Russia, along with the UK and the US, would “respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine” in return for Ukraine giving up Soviet-era nuclear weapons it had inherited.
Moscow repeatedly undermined the Minsk process designed to resolve the status of territories in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region that were seized in 2014-15 by pro-Russian militia. Putin persistently insisted Russia had no intention of invading Ukraine, until it did.
Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko recalled Monday how the ceasefire deal for Donbas signed by Russia in Paris in 2019 was violated by Moscow within weeks.
“Then, on February 18, 2020, Russians launched one of the largest assaults of the war. This is the Kremlin’s pattern: deception, false promises, and escalation,” Svyrydenko said.
More than Zelensky’s demands for security guarantees, that pattern is the greatest obstacle to peace.",['Tim Lister'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/politics/us-pause-intelligence-support-ukraine/index.html,Trump officials say US paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine but signal it may not last long after fiery meeting,2025-03-05 13:30:36,"The Trump administration appears to have ordered at least a partial halt to the crucial intelligence that the United States shares with Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion, according to a US military official and public remarks made by top Trump administration officials.
Statements from national security adviser Mike Waltz and CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Wednesday morning indicated that a pause in intelligence sharing is in place but the extent of the limitations was not clear. Both officials also suggested that the pause may be short-lived if the president can be satisfied that Ukraine has taken steps towards negotiations to end the war – a controversial effort that appeared to be derailed after Friday’s fiery Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
“We are pausing, assessing, looking at everything across our security relationship,” national security adviser Mike Waltz told CBS News, asked directly about intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. The Trump administration had already announced a freeze in weapons deliveries to Ukraine, part of the White House effort to attempt to pressure Kyiv into a swift end to a war it didn’t start.
Still, Waltz told reporters after the interview that he spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart over the phone this morning, and he projected optimism on the state of talks since Zelensky issued a statement yesterday saying that he is ready to negotiate peace.
“We are having good talks on location for the next round of negotiations, on delegations, on substance. So, just in the last 24 hours since the public statement from Zelensky, and then the subsequent conversations, which I’m going to walk inside and continue, I think we’re going to see movement in very short order,” Waltz said.
Zelensky’s top aide Andriy Yermak said later Wednesday that Ukrainian and US officials have agreed to meet “in the near future,” following the phone call with Waltz.
Yermak, who is Zelensky’s chief of staff, said he and Waltz “discussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace” during the call.
CIA Director John Ratcliffe in an interview on Fox Business on Wednesday also suggested that the pause on intelligence sharing may soon be ended.
“You saw the response that President Zelensky put out,” Ratcliffe said, referring to recent statements from the Ukrainian president that the country was ready to negotiate. “So I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away.”
If the freeze is total and sustained, multiple sources familiar with the information shared with Ukraine over the past three years of war said, it could deal a devastating blow to Kyiv’s ability to fight on.
“It’s pretty bad,” one source familiar with the arrangement said. “Combined with the stopping of military assistance and foreign aid, it pretty much guarantees a Russian victory without there needing to be a peace deal.”
A top Russian lawmaker, Andrei Kartapolov, in recent days called for the US to stop providing Ukraine with intelligence, underscoring the boon Trump may have already offered Moscow on the battlefield.
“It would be much more important if the Americans stopped giving them with intelligence information, then this would allow us to achieve results more quickly,” Kartapolov said.
Since the early days of the conflict, the US has provided extensive information on Russian force movements and locations, as well as intercepted communications about their military plans and the movement of their spies – intelligence that officials say has been as important as any American weapon system to both Ukraine’s ability to protect its cities and push back on Moscow on the battlefield.
When Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2022, the source familiar with the sharing said, Russia was planning an airborne operation to seize key facilities in Kyiv that could have allowed them to sack the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine was able to successfully derail the operation because of intelligence that the US shared.
In the lead up to Trump’s inauguration, Ratcliffe and the transition team were told of the value of intelligence sharing with Ukraine by US officials who stressed that it was a hallmark of their achievements on the battlefield, according to another source familiar with those discussions.
One US military official said that the US is now offering fewer surveillance flights to the Ukrainians, as well as less satellite coverage – both of which are essential to Ukraine’s ability to defend its cities against Russian missile attacks.
But underscoring the fluid nature of the situation, as recently as Tuesday, another US military official in the region said that American military contact with the Ukrainians, including some intelligence sharing, was continuing.
A key concern for Ukraine is whether the administration — or Trump’s ally, Elon Musk — will allow the satellite internet system Starlink to continue operating. That system has been a critical component to the Ukrainian military response that has allowed its forces to communicate on the battlefield.
For some US officials, the decision to limit intelligence sharing with Ukraine not only helps Russia — it is tantamount to a betrayal of Ukraine. The CIA has worked closely with Ukrainian special operations forces since 2014, when Russia first took action to seize control of Ukraine, supporting a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and annexing Crimea.
In the early days of the 2022 conflict, prominent Republicans — including now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio — complained that the Biden administration wasn’t sharing intelligence with the Ukrainian military quickly enough.
Now, many US military and intelligence officers “feel we are abandoning our allies on the battlefield,” said one former intelligence official who remains in contact with old colleagues.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/world/trump-cut-ukrainian-aid-patriot-missiles-intl/index.html,Trump’s cut to Ukrainian military aid could leave millions of civilians exposed to Russian ballistic missiles,2025-03-05 16:05:00,"Ukraine has only one way to protect itself against Russia’s most powerful ballistic missiles – US-made Patriot defense systems. With the United States now pausing military shipments to Kyiv, they could soon run out of ammo.
Kyiv and its allies are scrambling to come up with a plan after US President Donald Trump suspended military shipments to Ukraine on Monday, following his heated Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky last week.
The move may well have devastating consequences for Ukraine. However, much of the American military equipment that is used by the Ukrainians on the battlefield can be sourced elsewhere, produced domestically or replaced with alternatives – although there are serious questions about whether Ukraine’s allies could ever afford to match what the US was providing.
The biggest challenge for Ukraine, however, is the potential loss of the US-made Patriot air defense systems, which are currently irreplaceable. Ukrainian soldiers told CNN that their biggest immediate worry is not the impact of the cuts on the frontlines, but the lack of Patriot missiles protecting their families and loved ones across Ukrainian cities.
“The US holds the licensing to the Patriot missile systems, and also the missile production for them, which makes it very challenging for multiple European countries to recreate these,” said Kateryna Stepanenko, the Russia deputy team lead and analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor.
The Patriots are the crème de la crème of the equipment provided by the US to Ukraine and they play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defenses.
So the risk of losing them has sent Ukrainian officials into panic.
“This is the only system capable of dealing with Russian ballistic missiles. The risk relates to the provision of Patriots, both in terms of repairs, maintenance and ammunition to protect Ukraine from ballistic missiles,” the country’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Tuesday.
“We can destroy all other means of Russia’s terrorization of Ukraine with what we have in Ukraine, manufactured here or received from our partners,” Shmyhal added.
Russia has been launching waves of ballistic and cruise missiles towards Ukraine on regular basis, and been striking cities, energy infrastructure and civilian targets weekly. Last summer, it deployed a cruise missile to strike a children’s hospital in Kyiv.
Ballistic missiles follow a curved trajectory that takes them out of the Earth’s atmosphere, before plunging back into the atmosphere and onto its target. They travel at extremely high speeds, which makes them very difficult to intercept.
Cruise missiles meanwhile are unmanned vehicles that are propelled by jet engines, much like an airplane, and can be launched from ground, air, or sea. They are hard to detect because they tend to be smaller and fly low, and some can also travel at high speeds.
At the same time, Moscow has been increasing its stockpiles at a rate Ukraine cannot keep up with. Russia is manufacturing more munitions while also procuring them from allies such as Iran and North Korea.
It is unclear how many missiles Ukraine has in its stockpiles and whether more supplies were already on the way from the US.
A Ukrainian official told CNN on Tuesday that Kyiv’s stocks of Patriot missiles could run out in a matter of weeks.
Ukrainian soldiers on the frontlines were also quick to point out the Patriots as a key piece of equipment that Ukraine cannot afford to lose.
“Our weakness is in air-defense missiles – the Patriots,” said Yegor Firsov, the chief sergeant of a drone strike platoon. “Even we, the military, would like to have our families, our rear, protected as much as possible when we are serving on the frontline,” he said.
Effective defense at a huge cost
While they have been in use for nearly 40 years, the Patriots are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems. They are capable of bringing down cruise and hypersonic missiles, short-range ballistic missiles and aircraft.
Their effectiveness makes the Patriots a key target for Moscow – the Russian military has targeted the systems several times.
Zelensky said in the past that Ukraine would need some 25 Patriot systems to defend its airspace effectively.
It has roughly half a dozen at the moment, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.
The US was initially reluctant to provide Ukraine with the Patriots, only agreeing to it after months of near-daily Russian aerial attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets.
The first batteries arrived in Ukraine some 14 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and they have since become an integral part of Ukraine’s air defenses.
Ukrainian officials have previously said the country received three systems from the US, one from Germany, one from the Netherlands and one from Romania.
More than a dozen other countries are known to have Patriot batteries, including Greece, Saudi Arabia, Poland and South Korea, but they have been reluctant to send them to Ukraine because of the threats they themselves are facing.
Analysts say that the Ukrainian military has been using the Patriots in an extremely effective way, shooting down missiles that Moscow claimed were impossible to intercept, such as the Kinzhal ballistic missiles.
But this comes at a huge cost.
At an estimated cost of about $1.1 billion for each system, the Patriots are by far the most expensive piece of equipment sent by allies to Ukraine.
The Center for Strategic and International Studies said that missile rounds for the Patriot come in at roughly $4 million each – an incredibly high price tag.
There are some alternative systems – such as NASAMS and IRIS-T which have proved effective against cruise missiles and drones – but they cannot match the Patriots when it comes to protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles.
A weapon that could potentially replace the Patriot is the SAMP/T air defense system made by Eurosam, a European manufacturer. Ukraine would need many more of these systems for them to be as effective as the Patriots and there are currently major supply issues with the SAMP/T.
Resolving supply issues will be key if Europe is to step in and provide Ukraine with more aid. While the Patriots are the key systems Ukraine is most worried about in the short term, the sheer size and breadth of the aid that was coming from the US means other problems will likely arise soon.
The US had been providing Ukraine with artillery ammunition, armored vehicles, howitzers and missile systems such as HIMARS and ATACMS.
“The Patriots are the headline item, but beyond that it’s what we call the ‘invisible supplies,’” Mark Geleotti, a leading Russia analyst, told CNN.
“If you think about those M1 Abrams tanks and Bradley armored fighting vehicles, which had been very useful on the front line, if the Ukrainians run out of stocks or spare parts, then even when something relatively minor breaks down – and these things do need a lot of maintenance and break down a lot – then they’ll actually have to be pulled out of the line,” he added.
According to the Kiel Institute, which monitors aid to Ukraine, the military supplies that have been coming from Europe are comparable to those from the US.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/europe/explainer-trump-suspends-ukraine-military-aid-intl-latam/index.html,Why has Trump halted military aid to Ukraine and what will it mean for the war? Here’s what to know,2025-03-04 19:53:07,"US President Donald Trump has gone all in with his effort to strongarm Kyiv into peace negotiations with Russia, suspending US military aid to Ukraine with immediate effect.
The move has sent shockwaves through the Western world and left Ukraine and its allies scrambling.
Trump didn’t explain his decision beyond saying that he believed that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky “doesn’t want peace.” His advisers told CNN the pause will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made enough of a commitment to seeking peace talks.
Zelensky indicated on Tuesday that he was willing to go that way, saying Ukraine was “ready to come to the negotiating table” and that “my team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.”
Addressing a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, Trump said he appreciated getting a “letter” from Zelensky telling him he was ready to come to the negotiating table.
Here’s what we know.
What does this mean for Ukraine?
Trump’s order will have a direct impact on Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked aggression.
Oleksiy Melnyk, an international security expert and former Ukrainian defense ministry official, told CNN that US military aid currently accounts for around 30% of Ukraine’s weapons and ammunition needs.
“Is it critical? Yes,” he said, pointing to Ukraine’s persistent weapons and ammunition shortages. Kyiv has been outgunned and outmanned by its much bigger neighbor since the opening salvos of Russia’s full-scale invasion, and the situation has become worse whenever Western deliveries have dwindled.
“Having in mind the shortage of ammunition and weapons, even 1% is critical. Thirty percent is definitely critical. Is it tragic? What we are hearing from different sources, Ukraine will be able to sustain this level or about the same level of violence density for about six months,” Melnyk said.
“It will have significant consequences, but the Russians are not likely to break through immediately or in the coming months,” said Kateryna Stepanenko, the Russia deputy team lead and analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor.
“The Ukrainians will be able to hold a defense, as we had seen them do in the past during the previous problems with aid,” she added, pointing to last year when deliveries from the US slowed down as Congress stalled on the next aid package.
CNN military analyst and retired US Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton said that some munitions are being delivered with short notice, shipped to where they are most needed at any given moment.
“As a result, some of the effects could be felt almost immediately on the front lines. The Ukrainians will have to ration their use of certain munitions and that could spell trouble for their efforts to hold on to places like Pokrovsk,” he said.
An important logistics hub, Pokrovsk has been the prime target of Russia’s offensive in eastern Ukraine since the summer. Despite expectations that the city could fall within weeks, Kyiv’s forces have managed to hold Russian troops at bay – in part thanks to the steady deliveries of US military aid.
Which aid has been suspended?
The US had been providing Ukraine with artillery ammunition, tanks, armored vehicles, howitzers, Patriot air defense batteries and long-range rocket and missile systems.
But the pause spans beyond just hardware. US officials have confirmed on Wednesday that the US has paused intelligence support as well weapons shipments to Ukraine.
A senior US military official said the US has already curtailed some intelligence sharing, including carrying out fewer intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance flights that could impact both offensive and defensive operations including air defense, since Ukraine depends on US intelligence for overwatch.
Stepanenko said the intelligence sharing was “extremely important for Ukrainian forces” because it included things like satellite imagery, which Ukrainian forces use for drone operations. It is unclear whether the pause to intelligence sharing includes these.
The US has previously stopped humanitarian aid to Ukraine – as part of its overall pause on USAID programs.
Why is Trump doing this?
Trump is trying to force Ukraine into negotiating a peace deal with Russia without committing to providing security guarantees for Ukraine.
Zelensky has tried to make the case that a deal without guarantees would be potentially disastrous for Ukraine, arguing that Putin has violated ceasefire agreements in the past.
The Ukrainian leader has received near-universal backing from Kyiv’s Western allies on this point. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the UK Parliament on Monday that security guarantees must be part of any peace agreement.
“We know (Putin) is not a man to keep his word. We must be vigilant on all fronts in relation to Putin,” Starmer said.
Melnyk said that Ukraine had spent the past few weeks trying to understand which of Trump’s statements should be treated as policy announcements and which were just part of a strategy of trying to please the Russians and lure them into negotiations.
“With every practical step, there is more clarity that this is exactly what President Trump and his people are going to do (as policy). And currently, it’s not going to benefit anyone except our enemies and rivals like Russia and China,” he said.
He said the announcement on Monday sparked shock and sadness across Ukraine.
“Most Ukrainians simply glorify the United States of America and are being very sincere when saying ’God Bless America,’” he said. “This is a kind of real cold shower and probably one of the biggest shocks of the war.”
While Trump has not come out with a specific peace plan, he has suggested Ukraine will have to make sacrifices in terms of its territory, often repeating key Kremlin falsehoods and even suggesting that Ukraine “may be Russian someday.”
To many, this sounds like a capitulation.
John Lough, the head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre, said that Zelensky cannot accept such a proposal.
“I don’t really understand what (Zelensky) is supposed to be telling the Americans. ‘I am going to give our territory, I am going to agree to whatever terms that you discuss with the Russians?’” he said.
“I mean, this is absolutely absurd. They can’t do that, and they won’t do that,” he added.
Could Ukraine’s other allies help fill the hole?
The US is Ukraine’s biggest single provider of military aid, but not its only one.
According to the Kiel Institute, which monitors aid to Ukraine, the military aid that has been coming from Europe is comparable to that from the US and in the short term, the Europeans could step in and help Kyiv bridge the gap.
This has happened before – Europe’s aid became much more crucial during the first half of last year when US aid deliveries dwindled.
At the same time, Ukraine has become more self-reliant since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.
“Ukrainians have significantly ramped up their production of drones, of their artillery, of their own personnel carriers. They’ve been doing that since 2023 since facing the possibility of not having aid,” Stepanenko said.
The European Union on Tuesday unveiled a plan to allow member states to borrow €150 billion ($158 billion) to boost their defense spending and “massively step up” their military support for Kyiv. The EU used a similar approach to raise funds to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Some of Ukraine’s European allies are pushing for Russia’s frozen assets to be seized and used to fund defense aid. For now, only proceeds from these assets are being used to prop up Ukraine’s defense.
But the hard truth is that even if Europe had the necessary funds, it will take years for the underfunded European defense sector to measure up to that of the US.
There are also some weapon systems that only the US can provide, including the Patriot defense systems which are capable of bringing down cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, short-range ballistic missiles and aircraft.
“The US holds licensing to the systems themselves and the missiles for them, which makes it challenging for European countries to recreate them,” Stepanenko said. The Patriots play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defenses, protecting millions of civilians living across the country.
While other Western systems can be effective against cruise missiles and drones, the Patriots offer unparalleled protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles. Russia has been using these missiles on a regular basis; it has increased their domestic production and begun procuring more from North Korea.
What options does Ukraine have now?
Stepanenko said that Ukraine’s best option is to focus on strengthening its coalition with Europe.
“Ukraine had already laid pretty good groundwork for that by forming several initiatives, for example, several European states formed ammunition initiatives, they formed drone initiatives, air defense initiatives, and I think this is the time to expand those,” she said.
“There’s also a significant discussion about the need to seize Russian frozen assets in Europe to help sponsor any procurement of weapons, not just from the US, but also globally,” she added, pointing to countries like South Korea, which has in the past sold the US ammunition that was later given to Ukraine.
Trump has made no secret that he views the current blow-up through an extremely personal lens, blaming it entirely on Zelensky.
Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to NATO and former US special representative for Ukraine, said that if he were to advise Zelensky, he’d urge him to sign the deal on natural resources as soon as possible.
The deal was meant to be signed when Trump met Zelensky at the White House on Friday – during the meeting that spiraled out of control and ended prematurely when the Ukrainian leader was ordered to leave.
“This will align the US and Ukraine going forward and serve the interests of both countries,” Volker said.
“If I could advise President Zelensky, it would be do have a public, on-camera signing of the agreement, where he expresses his appreciation to the United States and the American people as Ukraine’s strategic partner, regrets the way the Oval Office meeting on Friday went, and makes clear that he is 100% committed to getting peace for Ukraine,” Volker told CNN.
Zelensky said on Tuesday that he was ready to sign the minerals deal “any time and in any convenient format.”
Writing on X, the Ukrainian president said it was “regrettable that his meeting with Trump “did not go the way it was supposed to be.”
He said Ukraine was “ready to come to the negotiating table,” adding that “my team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.”
But a leading Russia analyst and historian, Mark Geleotti, said that Zelensky and Ukraine might need to go “beyond the point of kind words” to repair the relationship.
“I think in the circumstances, what Trump is expecting is not just the kind of obsequious flattery that he didn’t get in the Oval Office, but it’s also, firstly signing the minerals agreement, secondly, accepting that, essentially, America will work out some kind of a deal with Russia and then bring it back to Ukraine,” he told CNN in an interview.
Could the aid be restarted?
The past few weeks have shown that the Trump administration is prepared to go on a rollercoaster ride to achieve what it wants – and that nobody can quite predict what will happen next.
Lough said that there still seem to be gaps in the administration policy on Ukraine – most notably in the way different officials view Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month, after meeting with Russian officials, that it remained to be seen whether Russia was serious about wanting peace.
“How do you reconcile that with what Trump is saying? He is implying he’s got Putin on side, that Putin is ready to go, and (they are) going to get a peace deal quickly,” Lough said.
“President Trump is mercurial, to say the least, but I think from a Ukrainian perspective, they can’t bank on the fact that he’s going to suddenly show mercy and switch on the aid again and perhaps put President (Vladimir) Putin under pressure. We don’t see any signs of that yet,” he added.
Trump has made several U-turns on Ukraine over the past few weeks, calling Zelensky a dictator one day only to deny having made that statement a few days later.
While White House officials have said Zelensky should come back once he is ready to talk about peace, it remains to be seen whether Zelensky’s willingness to sign the natural resources deal could turn the aid tap back on.
Geleotti is sceptical. “I think that the fundamental point is that, as far as Trump is concerned, Ukraine is a bought-and-paid-for vassal state and has to understand its place. So it’s not just a bit of flattery today. Its reassurance is that Ukraine now understands that it has to do whatever America tells it to do,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/trump-administration-ukraine-aid/index.html,"Trump pauses military aid to Ukraine after Oval Office argument with Zelensky, White House official says",2025-03-04 00:31:50,"President Donald Trump is ordering a pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine after his heated Oval Office argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official told CNN Monday.
The halt in aid, which came after Trump held a series of meetings with top national security officials at the White House, could have dire effect on Ukraine’s war-fighting abilities, officials and analysts said. It will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said, essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield.
“The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” the White House official said.
After more than a week of open hostility between Washington and Kyiv, Monday’s pause was the most material sign of how far the relationship has deteriorated since Trump took office.
In recent weeks, Trump has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s talking points, falsely claiming Ukraine started the war and accusing Zelensky of being a dictator, but his decision to halt the delivery of military aid is a move that could have real consequences for the balance of the conflict and strengthen Putin’s hand.
The pause will apply to all military equipment not yet inside Ukraine, officials said, and amounts to a direct response to what Trump views as Zelensky’s bad behavior last week.
Ukraine could likely sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks — perhaps until the start of the summer — before a US pause would begin to have a major effect, Western officials said in the wake of the decision. The Biden administration rushed shipments of weapons to Ukraine in its waning days, providing the country with large stockpiles of advanced weapons.
It is those sophisticated weapons — including the long-range ATACMS missiles — that have allowed Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, a strategy that could suffer if those weapons remain paused.
While European nations may be able to replace US shipments of artillery, supplemented by Ukraine’s own growing defense industry, the most advanced weapons used by Kyiv come from the United States.
Impact could be ‘crippling’
“The impact is going to be big. I would call it crippling,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has closely followed the war.
Cancian estimated that Ukraine would feel the impacts of the pause in aid within two to four months, as aid from European countries helps Kyiv remain in the fight for now. “That’s why they don’t fall off a cliff, but when your supplies get cut in half, eventually that shows up on the front lines,” Cancian said. “Their front lines would continue to buckle and eventually they would break and Ukraine would have to accept an adverse – even catastrophic – peace settlement.”
But Cancian warned the Trump administration has more forms of aid to Ukraine that can be paused or canceled altogether, including intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces. “There might be a way out of this, but it’s going to be extremely humiliating for Zelensky,” Cancian said.
The White House made the decision to pause military aid to Ukraine for now as officials seek an acknowledgement from Zelensky about the breakdown in relations following Friday’s blowup in the Oval Office.
According to several officials, Trump and his senior aides are seeking an acknowledgement from Zelensky – potentially in the form of a public apology – before moving ahead with a deal on Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, which had been close to agreement before Friday’s meeting, or a discussion on continuing foreign aid. The decision to halt the aid was made later on Monday, one person said, and is part of a pressure strategy on Ukraine.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio publicly called for Zelensky to apologize for Friday in an interview on CNN.
The halt puts Trump even more clearly at odds with the United States’ traditional European allies like Britain and France, who made clear their support for Zelensky at a summit in London on Sunday.
“There is a capability gap that Europe cannot fill alone,” one US official said.
A European official called the Trump administration’s decision to pause military aid to Ukraine “petty and wrong.”
The official said it will immediately deepen distrust in the US government among the Ukrainian people. The official also predicted it will cause unnecessary civilian casualties, as Ukraine will not be able to defend against Russian air attacks after they run out of air defense missiles.
“I’m beyond disappointed,” the official told CNN
Since the start of the war, the Biden administration announced 74 separate packages of military aid pulled directly from US inventories, allowing the critical munitions and supplies to flow quickly to Ukraine. The largest of these packages was nearly $3 billion, though most were far smaller. Zelensky has repeatedly thanked the US for the weapons on social media, as well as in calls and meetings with American officials.
The pause comes one day after a defense official told CNN that military aid to Ukraine announced by the Biden administration was still flowing. Those shipments included critical munitions such as anti-tank weapons, thousands of artillery rounds, and rockets. Those shipments were expected to continue for several weeks, but the decision from the Trump administration freezes the aid that was en route.
“DoD is also providing other capabilities, such as armored vehicles, as soon as required repairs are completed,” the defense official said on Sunday. The US had set up facilities in Poland to repair Western equipment damaged on the battlefield before sending it back to the Ukrainian military.
There are also multiple longer-term contracts between arms manufacturers and the US to send weapons systems and air defense systems to Ukraine.
Mixed reaction from Republicans
Republicans in Congress, where the party holds majorities in both chambers, have been split on continuing aid to Ukraine amid its three-year war with Russia.
Earlier Monday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, said he thought the US obligation to Ukraine only goes “so far,” saying, “the American taxpayers are tired of funding this war, and there’s no end in sight.”
“I don’t believe that any of us sitting here believes that Ukraine can win this war, and the president is saying, ‘Let’s bring an end to it,’” the Oklahoma Republican continued, adding that if Zelensky wants the US to continue negotiating peace, “then we will.”
However, he warned if Zelensky “doesn’t want to negotiate peace, then it’s not our job to make the taxpayers continue to fund an endless war.”
GOP Sen. Susan Collins, however, denounced the pause on Monday night, arguing that the US needs to continue backing its ally.
“This is a critical time for Ukraine. And I managed the Ukraine supplemental last year that provided additional help to Ukraine, and I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It’s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,” the Maine Republican said.
Collins acknowledged that Congress may not be able to do anything to ensure Ukraine continues to receive aid from the US.
“A lot of it is linked to the president’s drawdown authority,” she noted, pointing to accusations during former President Joe Biden’s term that he had “slow walked” aid.
“Unfortunately, we’ve seen this movie before, and I remain convinced that it’s not only in Ukraine’s interest but our interest to back Ukraine because Putin is not going to stop there,” she said.
House Foreign Affairs Chair Republican Rep. Brian Mast told CNN he “knew it was an option” for the Trump administration to pause all US military aid to Ukraine.
“I think people can assume that everything is on the table with Ukraine right now,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/trump-zelensky-national-security-meetings/index.html,Trump continues to seethe at Zelensky as national security team gathers to discuss what’s next on Ukraine,2025-03-03 18:48:15,"Top Trump Cabinet secretaries and national security officials are holding meetings this week to discuss the administration’s next steps on Ukraine – including the prospect of suspending military aid – following the spectacular collapse of Friday’s Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz, among others, planned to meet Monday as they map out how to move forward with peace talks, a Trump administration official and a State Department official told CNN.
“We’re going to have a broad discussion on what’s next,” Waltz told CNN on Monday.
There was little evidence the ill will between Washington and Kyiv was waning three days after the Oval Office blow up. Trump and top advisers continued to harshly criticize Zelensky for his demeanor and outlook on the war, refusing to rule out the notion he should resign.
“I just think he should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room on Monday when asked what it would take to revive a rare earths mineral deal.
Earlier, Trump slammed Zelensky’s remarks to reporters that the end to the war “is still very, very far away.”
“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “[T]his guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. – Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?”
Trump’s stance, not for the first time in recent weeks, seemed close to the Kremlin’s.
Earlier on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov suggested that “someone must force Zelensky to change his position,” adding, “someone must make Zelensky want peace.”
Zelensky’s latest comments to rile the president came at the end of a gathering of Western leaders, without Trump, in London, where the US’ traditional allies including Britain, France and Canada made clear they remain staunchly supportive of Zelensky and are on a very different page to the US president.
Officials said they wanted to see a public apology with expression of regret from Zelensky before they could resume talks on the mineral deal that was scrapped after the Oval Office debacle.
Behind closed doors, Trump aides were considering how to get both Russia and Ukraine to agree to a potential ceasefire and how to end long-range strikes, including on critical energy infrastructure, the administration official said.
Also on the table were questions over whether the Trump administration will pause funding for Ukraine committed by the Biden administration, something Trump officials have flirted with even before the president took office. No decisions had been made Monday morning on halting American assistance, but Trump suggested his patience was wearing thin.
“Obviously when you’re trying to assess how to move forward, you won’t exclude options. All options are a matter of discussion,” the official said.
“I just think he should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin.”
Trump did not rule out halting American aid in his remarks from the White House.
“We’ll see what happens,” he said.
The Trump administration is also considering whether to cut back on intelligence sharing with Kyiv, a US official told CNN.
Throughout the war, US intelligence has been critical to support Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russia’s military and to fight back against the Kremlin’s forces.
New funding to transport aid unlikely
US military officials said on Monday that it appeared unlikely that the Trump administration would request additional funding for Ukraine aid from Congress, which will be required for the US military — and in particular the Army — to continue transporting military equipment to Ukraine and training Ukrainian troops.
The Army has been paying for the transportation of the aid and the training out of its own budget, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, military officials said. But the branch will have to either cut back or halt those operations if it doesn’t receive new funding.
A similar situation played out last year, when funding for Ukraine faced an uncertain future in Congress and left the Army to foot the bill for hundreds of millions of dollars in support for Kyiv’s war effort.
At that time, under the Biden administration, these operations were considered mission critical, so money had to be moved around from within the Defense Department’s budget to support them. But this time, it’s far from clear that support for Ukraine remains a White House or Pentagon priority.
As of Sunday, aid was still moving into Ukraine. A defense official told CNN that “the Department is continuing to deliver via previously-approved [presidential drawdown authorities] some of the critical munitions, including hundreds of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) and anti-tank weapons and thousands of artillery rounds, that Ukraine is employing on the battlefield when they are available from our stocks.”
The official added that “DoD is also providing other capabilities, such as armored vehicles, as soon as required repairs are completed.”
Already, some Republicans have raised alarms about the administration potentially cutting off support for Kyiv. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said over the weekend she was feeling unwell over “whispers from the White House that they may try to end all US support for Ukraine.”
“I know foreign policy is not for the faint of heart, but right now, I am sick to my stomach,” she wrote.
The discussions come as the president and members of his Cabinet have continued to publicly question Zelensky’s intentions and express skepticism that he is ready for a peace deal.
Earlier Monday, Walz argued that “what became so evident to us in that session [on Friday] was he is not ready to talk peace at all.”
“What we don’t have right now is President Zelensky saying, ‘I am ready to take the steps necessary and have the conversations necessary and make the compromises necessary to end the fighting,’” Waltz told Fox News.
“We’re ready to have those conversations. We had it with the Russians in Riyadh,” Waltz said, referring to last month’s US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. “We’re ready to have it with the Ukrainians and then engage in shuttle diplomacy. But we need to hear that latter piece from Zelensky, and we need to hear it publicly.”
Trump administration officials are still committed to moving forward with navigating an off-ramp to the war, the sources said. That includes continuing talks with the Russians and Ukrainians. CNN previously reported that preparations are now underway for a second round of US-Russia talks, to be hosted shortly, potentially also in a Gulf state.
“We are not gonna stop to make movements to try and stop to end the war,” the administration official told CNN. “But it would be extremely helpful if Zelensky expressed an openness to go somewhere other than where we are today,” the official said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/europe/analysis-trump-zelensky-resign-impossible-intl-latam/index.html,Trump officials suggest Zelensky should step aside. Here’s why that’s nearly impossible,2025-03-03 20:49:56,"For days Trump cabinet officials have suggested Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky might need to step aside. Yet Ukrainian officials and analysts told CNN any change of president in Kyiv would spark at least six months of political limbo, and require an enduring ceasefire in the war before elections could be held that would conform to international standards.
There are three major hurdles to holding new elections, officials said. Only three quarters of Ukraine’s polling stations are operable at present and preparations to get elections to “international standards” would take six months, said the deputy head of Ukraine’s electoral commission, Serhiy Dubovyk.
Ukraine’s constitution also mandates, upon the president’s resignation, that the speaker of parliament takes his place until elections are complete.
Finally, Ukraine is currently under martial law, prohibiting elections until it is lifted, meaning a sustained ceasefire or peace would be needed.
Focus on Zelensky’s future has grown since US President Donald Trump’s closest advisers spent Sunday hinting he might no longer be the leader Ukraine needs. On Monday, Trump responded to Zelensky being quoted as saying an end to the war was “very, very far away” by suggesting America would not put up with such talk “for much longer.” Conversely, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump had no interest in removing the Ukrainian president.
Zelensky himself appeared to dismiss the idea of his resignation when he spoke to journalists Sunday in London, providing a riddle of how to remove him from power.
“It is not enough to simply hold elections,” he said. “You would have to prevent me from participating in the elections … You’ll have to negotiate with me,” he said, before suggesting, as he has done previously, that he would resign if Ukraine received NATO membership – something the Trump administration has repeatedly ruled out. He joked, with a little defiance, that NATO entering Ukraine would mean “that I have fulfilled my mission.”
The practical headaches of staging an election swiftly are manifold, said Dubovyk. “First, the legal aspect of ending martial law must happen,” he said.
“Secondly, there must be a preparatory process, because the country is at war, with systemic damage (and) only 75 percent of polling stations are ready for the elections, including on the occupied territories.”
He said “the six-month preparatory period confirmed by representatives of all factions of the (Ukrainian parliament, the) Verkhovna Rada is a reasonable timeframe.”
He added it could be “accelerated, but in this case, it is impossible to fully guarantee compliance with all international standards.”
Dubovyk and several other Ukrainian officials mentioned the logistical challenge of allowing the approximately 7 million Ukrainians living abroad as refugees the chance to vote, and the potential frontline crisis of having to allow the estimated million Ukrainians in the military the chance to both vote, and run in, the election.
The Kremlin has persistently referred to what it claims is the illegitimacy of Zelensky, falsely questioning his mandate in wartime, a talking point that crept into the White House’s statements last month.
Election advocates said this, and Russia’s history of electoral interference – such as when it sparked the vast pro-Western protests of the Orange Revolution in 2004 – made it only more important to ensure the vote met international standards.
“We need to reload all freedoms of movement and speech, and have a competitive electoral process,” said Olha Aivazovska, from the electoral reform group the Opora civil network.
She said elections in wartime were “impossible because it will be unconstitutional. Everything we have now because of the war, we have to change. It is about the reputation and legitimacy of the Ukrainian state as it is. Without legitimacy this state will not survive, because Russia will destroy our reputation and then we will be a failed state.”","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Victoria Butenko']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/23/world/charts-ukraine-war-status-dg/index.html,Visualizing how Ukraine has changed in the 3 years since Russia’s full-scale invasion,2025-02-21 00:00:00,"US President Donald Trump is pushing for a quick end to the war in Ukraine, but it’s proving more difficult than he thought.
A heated meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has left the White House reeling, with some top US officials suggesting Zelensky step down from power. The meeting came after top US and Russian officials met for peace talks in Saudi Arabia – cutting Ukraine out of negotiations.
Ukraine and its European allies have been stunned and scrambling to adapt to the new approach from the United States, and now Europe is trying to come together in support of Ukraine, crafting a plan to stop the fighting which will be presented to the US.
In the three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine has lost swaths of land, managing to regain some thanks to military aid from its Western allies. Millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted with thousands killed or injured.
Here’s where things stand in Ukraine, in four graphics:
Ukraine has lost 11% of its land since 2022
At the start of the war, Ukraine held back troops from its capital, Kyiv, and later secured victories in parts of the northeast Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions. But it also sustained major losses in eastern areas around Donetsk and Bakhmut.
Since the 2022 invasion, Ukraine has lost control of about 11% of its land, according to CNN analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor. When factoring in land already lost to Russia and Russian-backed separatists since the conflict began in 2014, the total land Ukraine has lost to Russia since 2014 is about 18%, per CNN calculations.
In 2014, Russian forces illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine, shortly after the events of the Maidan Revolution sparked political turmoil in Kyiv. Later that year, Russian-sponsored separatists took control of parts of the Donbas region, gains that have remained in Russian hands to the present day.
When Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin expected to seize all of Ukraine in a matter of days, according to the Institute for the Study of War. What happened instead was three years of intense fighting, thanks to Ukraine counteroffensives armed by tranches of aid coming from its Western allies.
The threat to Ukraine’s biggest source of aid
Here’s an overview of where the money for Ukraine’s war efforts has come from:
The United States has been the biggest single contributor of funding for Ukraine since the war began in 2022, giving about $123 billion in military, humanitarian and financial help — aid that may be in peril under the Trump administration.
Trump, who promised to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, was critical about US funds being sent to Ukraine throughout his 2024 campaign. Recently, he’s suggested taking a transactional approach to aid, saying the US should receive access to rare earth minerals in return, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected.
“I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion of rare earth, and they’ve essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don’t feel stupid. Otherwise we’re stupid. I said to them, we have to get something. We can’t continue to pay this money,” Trump told Fox News earlier this month.
Ukraine has already been affected by the recent suspension of USAID activity. The funding freeze has led Ukrainian NGOs and charities to make cuts including laying off staff and temporarily shutting down suicide helplines and HIV detection projects. In the last three years, Ukraine has been the biggest recipient of USAID funds.
Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced
Millions of Ukrainians have fled their homes, either to other parts of Ukraine or other countries, in the years since Russia began seizing land and following the invasion.
Just over 6.3 million Ukrainian refugees are living in Europe, including about 1.2 million in Germany, nearly 1 million in Poland and 390,000 in the Czech Republic, according to data through the end of 2024 from the UN’s refugee agency.
There were 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees living in the Russian Federation, per the UN’s latest estimate as of June 2024.
Thousands of civilians have died
More than 40,000 civilians have been killed or injured in Ukraine during the conflict, with many of the deaths caused by explosive weapons, according to the UN Human Rights Office.
At least half of those killed (6,203) were adult men and 669 were children.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/politics/trump-zelensky-europe-ukraine/index.html,White House amplifies rave reviews for Trump’s handling of Zelensky showdown as Europe rallies around Ukraine,2025-03-02 17:36:15,"The White House is making clear it views President Donald Trump’s Friday Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as an overwhelming win that underscores Trump’s “America first” leadership, dispatching top officials and allies to amplify Trump’s handling of the situation even as European leaders are expressing unified support for Ukraine and its leader.
Trump often took aim at US aid for Ukraine on the campaign trail, reflecting waning support among Americans for Ukraine and Zelensky over the past three years of the war. Trump views the conflict through an economic lens, seeking to rebuild a partnership with Russia and recoup some of the financial support the US has provided to Ukraine.
The president’s top lieutenants, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — all of whom were in the Oval Office during the explosive meeting — appeared on news shows Sunday to offer praise to their boss and criticism of his Ukrainian counterpart as Trump is dramatically reshaping US alliances.
The efforts come as dozens of European leaders are gathering in London for what British Prime Minister Keir Starmer described as a “once-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe,” a major show of support for Zelensky.
“I hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes, everyone around this table,” Starmer said in opening remarks at the Sunday summit.
Trump’s team, meanwhile, is doubling down, framing the contentious Friday meeting from a position of US strength, even as it has been met with glee by the Kremlin.
During an appearance on “State of the Union,” Waltz indicated US support for new leadership in Ukraine.
“We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war,” Waltz told CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday.
“And if it becomes apparent that President Zelensky’s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands,” Waltz said.
House Speaker Mike Johnson also suggested in an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Zelensky should potentially step aside after the tense meeting, saying, “Either he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country to do that.”
Trump himself suggested after the meeting that Zelensky does not want an end to the war. Waltz said Sunday that the Ukrainian leader needs to make it clear “publicly and privately” that he is “ready to go to peace.”
Waltz, who compared Zelensky to an “ex-girlfriend that just wants to argue” earlier in the weekend, continued to slam the Ukrainian leader’s Friday actions and body language, castigating “the shaking of the head, the kind of — the arms crossed, we just — we found it incredibly disrespectful.”
Rubio also went after Zelensky, who, he said on ABC News’ “This Week,” “found every opportunity to try to ‘Ukraine-splain’ on every issue.”
And Lutnick cast Trump as “the peacemaker.”
“He’s the peacemaker, and if Zelensky is not interested in peace, then he should go home and think about it,” he told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.”
The White House press office has also sent multiple emails amplifying warm reviews and messages of support from key Republican allies on Capitol Hill, members of Trump’s Cabinet and other top White House officials.
“Support continues to roll in for the unwavering commitment of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Vance to the American people and the Trump Administration’s relentless pursuit of peace,” an email sent to reporters Saturday said, highlighting remarks from Johnson praising Trump for “putting America first”; from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard thanking Trump for his “unwavering leadership”; and from Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri asserting that “the age of ‘America last’ foreign policy is over,” among others.
Johnson, who spearheaded an effort to pass more aid to Ukraine last spring despite threats to his speakership from some hardliners in his own party, told Bash he had done so to “allow Ukraine to sustain itself and position them for peace negotiations” by extending support until Trump took office.
“The plan worked, but now Zelensky has to follow through, and the fact that he acted as he did, I think, was a great disappointment,” the Louisiana Republican said.
He said an assessment by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a frequent GOP critic of the president, that the Trump administration was “walking away from our allies and embracing Putin,” was “plainly wrong,” arguing that Trump, who has hesitated to call Putin a “dictator,” has been “very clear” that the Russian president is an aggressor in Ukraine.
Former House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner, historically an avid supporter of Ukraine and hardliner on Russia, called Zelensky’s actions during the meeting with Trump “inappropriate.”
“You got to hear President Trump. I mean … he engaged by saying, you know, people are dying,” the Ohio Republican congressman said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “We need to stop the dying. … Let’s go forward with the peace negotiations, and then we’ll determine what security arrangements need to be made around the peace negotiations.”","['Betsy Klein', 'Alison Main', 'Aileen Graef']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/01/europe/zelensky-trump-support-ukraine-intl/index.html,Zelensky says Trump’s backing is ‘crucial’ after US president berated him at White House,2025-02-28 00:00:00,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky says US support is “crucial” a day after cutting short a visit to Washington DC following an extraordinary public argument with Donald Trump.
A meeting intended to discuss a natural resources deal imploded, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating the Ukrainian leader in front of reporters in the Oval Office. At one point, when Zelensky tried to respond, an angry Trump accused him of “gambling with World War III.”
A Europe already rattled by Trump’s overtures to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin quickly rallied around Zelensky, with the European Union’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, saying in a statement that it’s “clear that the free world needs a new leader.”
On Saturday, Zelensky appeared conciliatory when he posted on social media after arriving in London to meet UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
“It’s crucial for us to have President Trump’s support,” Zelensky said in a series of posts on X on Saturday morning. “He wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do.”
Zelensky emphasized his gratitude for the US’ backing of Ukraine in the three years since Russia invaded his country.
In Friday’s fiery exchange, Vance questioned whether the Ukrainian leader had been thankful enough for US support.
“We are very grateful to the United States for all the support. I’m thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and American people. Ukrainians have always appreciated this support, especially during these three years of full-scale invasion,” Zelensky reiterated in his posts on social media.
The Ukrainian leader stressed that, despite Friday’s clash, Ukraine and the US “remain strategic partners. But we need to be honest and direct with each other to truly understand our shared goals.”
He said that Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals agreement that he had traveled to the US to hammer out, but noted that “it’s not enough,” highlighting the absence of the security guarantees he’s been seeking.
“We need more than just that. A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine. We’ve been fighting for three years, and Ukrainian people need to know that America is on our side,” Zelensky said.
Starmer told Zelensky Saturday that Ukraine has the UK’s “full backing” as they met at the British leader’s official residence in London. Starmer expressed “his unwavering support for Ukraine,” according to an official readout of the meeting from Downing Street.
The two leaders signed an agreement to accelerate $2.8 billion worth of loans to Ukraine – to be paid off by frozen sovereign Russian assets. Zelensky said the funds would go toward the production of weapons in Ukraine, and added that he and Starmer spoke about “reliable security guarantees.”
Zelensky also announced that King Charles had accepted an invitation to meet on Sunday.
Zelensky’s UK trip comes ahead of a summit of European leaders on Sunday, which was announced amid growing concern that the Trump administration’s push to work with Russia could exclude Ukraine from deciding its own fate.
Just last week, Trump wrongly accused Ukraine of starting the war with Russia and called Zelensky a “dictator.” The week before, he said that Ukraine “may be Russian someday” when discussing what has now become the minerals agreement.
Russian officials reacted with glee to Friday’s fractious meeting. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said Zelensky had “finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office.”
Meanwhile, a flurry of Western countries took to X to show their staunch support for Kyiv.
A joint statement by the leaders of the European Union, said that Zelensky’s “dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people.”
NATO chief Mark Rutte called the fractious Zelensky-Trump meeting “very unfortunate.” In an interview with BBC News, Rutte added that “it is important that President Zelensky finds a way to restore his relationship with the American president and with the senior American leadership team.”","['Catherine Nicholls', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/europe/ukraine-titanium-mine-rare-earth-trump-deal-intl-hnk/index.html,"Inside a struggling Ukraine mine, Trump’s mineral deal dreams meet war-torn reality",2025-02-28 05:01:18,"The extractor’s part-rusting mechanical arm winds out over the frozen ground, over a sprawling lunar landscape of unnatural colors. The mining of titanium has a greater urgency than ever, here in Irshansk.
The electricity that powers the vast machines is only sometimes on for three hours a day. But resources like titanium are potentially key to the moonshot rare earth minerals deal that is suddenly the focus of talking peace in Ukraine. The deal’s signatories, the United States and Ukraine, appear to have opposing interpretations of its terms, which leave many thorny details for a later discussion.
Some current and former US officials have cast doubt on President Donald Trump’s claim that the potential deal he is on the verge of signing with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky would offer the US easy access to a plethora of rare earth minerals.
Much of what does exist will be difficult to exploit, particularly at a time of war.
And from this beleaguered mine in the northwestern town of Irshansk, it is hard to see how Ukraine could, in this lifetime, get to the half a trillion dollars Trump has suggested they might repay.
“Now we don’t know what and how our work will go on even tomorrow”, said Dmytro Holik, director of mining and concentrating plant at Ukrainian conglomerate Group DF.
“Every day we see how Ukraine’s energy system is being destroyed. Every day, entire regions are cut off in an emergency,” he added, a reference to the waves of drones and missiles Russia pounds Ukrainian homes and energy infrastructure with each night.
The plant’s staff are mostly men, kept away from conscription as titanium is considered a critical industry. Profits are low, prospects dim. “Our enterprise is now very unstable, and this leads to a very high cost of our products,” Holik said.
The proposed minerals bonanza now at the heart of continued US aid to Ukraine in the largest war in Europe since the 1940s, seems to speak to a fantastical future world of prosperity.
Trump on Thursday held out the possibility of American personnel in Ukraine working to extract minerals once a mineral resources deal - and peace - was in effect.
“When you talk about economic development, we’re going to have a lot of people over there,” he said. “So we’ll be working in the country. So I just don’t think you’re going to have a problem.”
Opaque deal
The nature of the framework deal - which, according to a text seen by CNN Wednesday morning to be signed by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukranian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ - is as opaque as elements of the industry they seek to harness.
It refers to half the value of “relevant Ukrainian Government-owned natural resource assets,” but says the specific details will be “agreed by both Participants, as may be further described in the Fund Agreement.” The deal goes on to say these won’t include “current sources of revenues… already part of the budget revenues of Ukraine.”
The extent of Ukraine’s mineral wealth is unclear.
Ukrainian officials accept they sometimes rely on Soviet-era geological dating. Yet in a recent presentation by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, Kyiv claimed 7% of the world’s titanium production, and to have 3% of the lithium reserves – which have not been mined yet. It also said Ukraine was in the top five nations of graphite reserves, and had deposits of the rare earth minerals tantalum, niobium and beryllium.
The numbers resemble those in the Ukraine chapter of the US Geological Survey’s 2020-2021 Minerals Yearbook, written before Russia’s full-scale invasion disrupted production. The USGS said at the time that Ukraine was the fifth-ranked producer of titanium sponge, and the sixth largest producer of graphite.
A USGS mineral commodity summary for 2025 had no figure for graphite reserves, and said, among other observations, that Ukraine was a source of the rare earth metal scandium and had shuttered a 1.7 million-ton a year alumina refinery since 2022.
Natalia Bariatska, a doctor of geology and member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists, said critical raw materials were all at different stages of research and exploration.
“It is very difficult to talk about the actual value of these deposits,” Bariatska said. “We can speak about the value of the elements in the subsoil, but we have to understand it takes a lot of investment to extract, process and sell them.”
While the framework deal leaves it unclear what assets will be impacted by any future fund, US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz made an explicit reference during a White House briefing on February 20 to one Ukrainian “aluminum foundry.”
“It’s been damaged, it is not at its current capacity, if restored it would account for America’s entire imports of aluminum for an entire year,” Waltz said.
Waltz did not name the foundry, and the White House did not respond to a request for clarification at the time of publication. But the most likely facility he was referring to is the Zaporizhzhia industrial aluminum integrated plant.
Mothballed a decade ago, a video of the plant released by Ukrainian investigators in 2015 shows it in significant disrepair. It is since running on a much-reduced staff, and has been hit by a missile, according to a filing with the State Property Fund of Ukraine.","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Daria Markina-Tarasova']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/trump-ukraine-minerals-doubts-resources/index.html,Trump’s promise of ‘very big deal’ with Zelensky undercut by officials’ widespread doubts over Ukraine’s resources,2025-02-28 00:01:59,"President Donald Trump’s claim that the potential “trillion-dollar deal” he is on the cusp of signing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would offer the US easy access to a bonanza of rare earth minerals is at odds with the widespread assessment of current and former US officials who say there’s little actual evidence of great rare earth and other mineral wealth in Ukraine and much of what does exist will be difficult, even impossible, to exploit in the eastern war-torn part of the country.
“We’ll be dig, dig, digging,” Trump told reporters on the eve of Zelensky’s visit. “The American taxpayers will now effectively be reimbursed for the money and hundreds of billions of dollars poured into helping Ukraine defend itself.”
The agreement expected to be signed Friday at the White House could be seen as a coup for an embattled Zelensky, who is giving Trump a deal he can trumpet at a time that US support is faltering.
“It’s an important political undertaking that binds the two countries together,” a senior US official said. “The deal is bigger than subsoil. And it’s politically important for the Ukrainians at this juncture.”
Current and former US officials, as well as analysts and experts, have all emphasized that there isn’t a clear picture of precisely what resources Ukraine has that can be exploited. There appears to be no modern assessment and what is known is based on decades old, Soviet-era mapping.
While Trump has emphasized rare earth minerals and the American need for them, the US Geological Survey says Ukraine has zero proven reserves of rare earth minerals, or processing facilities.
Ukraine does have vast deposits of other minerals like graphite, lithium and titanium, which the US considers critical minerals, but they pale compared to other countries’.
“If we zoom out, on a global scale it’s not a ton,” said Jack Conness, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation. “Generally speaking, it’s not to say these resources don’t exist but we know very little about what there is to offer.”
The idea was originally Zelensky’s and gained steam when he visited the US last September and shopped around his ‘Victory Plan.’ The plan, both Trump and Biden administration officials say, included giving the US access to some of Ukraine’s natural resources wealth in exchange for continued US support.
That was shortly before the presidential election and Zelensky presented it to both the Trump and Biden teams, among others.
“It just wasn’t taken as something that was at all realistic,” said a former senior Biden administration official. “That was the part [of the victory plan] we discussed the least.”
“Let me just say that I’m not aware of a single US company that was clamoring to get into the mining business in Ukraine,” the former official added.
For Biden officials, Zelensky’s offer appeared clearly directed at Trump, because Ukraine saw him as transactional and reluctant to continue the same significant levels of US support for the country’s war effort.
A person familiar with the ongoing conversations inside the Trump administration about the deal and war in Ukraine agreed there are no recent surveys of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals that the US government has been able to independently confirm.
A US official familiar with classified intelligence assessments on the issue added that the consensus across the government is that the value of Ukraine’s rare earth and other minerals doesn’t approach the sky-high estimates of various Trump officials.
At first Trump demanded a $500 billion share of Ukraine’s rare earth and other minerals, which Zelensky quickly rejected. On Tuesday Trump said the deal that was agreed to would give Ukraine “$350 billion and lots of equipment, military equipment, and the right to fight on.”
Maps of the estimated mineral deposits – widely considered outdated – show them spread across the country, including some well away from the front line. But deposits aren’t always worth exploiting, experts say, and the most significant potential lies farther east in unstable, contested and Russian-occupied areas.
“Based on what we do know, the vast majority of the deposits appear to be in Russian-controlled territory,” said a second former senior Biden official familiar with the assessments. Others are under land littered by mines and unexploded ordnance.
Extracting, processing and refining minerals, particularly the rare earth variety, can be extraordinarily expensive and take a long time.
“This deal has many complications to it that will make it exceedingly difficult for the US to get the benefits out of it that are being portrayed,” the former official said.
On Thursday, Trump acknowledged the uncertainty about what resources may actually be available to be exploited.
“You never know when it comes to that. You know you dig and maybe things aren’t there like you think they’re there,” Trump said. “But we’ll be spending a lot of time there. It’ll be great for Ukraine. It’s like a huge economic development project. So, it’ll be good for both countries.”
According to a draft of the agreement seen by CNN, it makes no mention of Trump’s claims that Washington could recoup the value of the aid the Biden administration sent to Ukraine.
Instead, it, calls for the establishment of a “Reconstruction Investment Fund” to be jointly managed by both countries and used to rebuild the country’s cities and infrastructure.
As the Trump administration presses forward with efforts to end the war, Zelensky’s government has aggressively pressed the Trump administration for security guarantees from Washington to prevent a future Russian invasion.
Trump has resisted, saying he will not send US troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers and that Ukraine shouldn’t be a member of NATO. Two positions critics have said are premature concessions to Russia.
Instead, Trump officials have argued a minerals deal would provide the kind of security assurances Ukraine is looking for because the US would have a vested interest in keeping its projects and revenue safe.
“Of course, the US would protect our assets, for which we are invested in,” National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News in a Monday interview. “This could mean trillions, not only for the Ukrainian people but for us and for stability for the region. And that economic investment is one of the best security guarantees that Ukraine could hope for.”
The natural resources agreement seen by CNN doesn’t specify the scope, location and types of materials that are expected to be exploited. It leaves more many details to be negotiated in a future agreement for a jointly owned fund.
It defines natural resources as deposits of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas and other extractable materials, along with associated infrastructure.
Russia’s economy may be weakening dramatically but observers believe it still has the mass and manpower to fight on against a Ukraine that has seen millions of its citizens flee and its army facing severe personnel shortages.
“From Zelensky’s perspective what else can he offer the US or the West?” asked the second senior Biden administration official. “They correctly gauged this would be something that would pique the interest of the Trump team.”
“There’s nothing wrong with the US doing a deal,” the former official said. “I just don’t think there’s all that much too it.”
In addition to the uncertainty and impracticality of extracting Ukraine’s minerals, the Biden administration didn’t pursue it because, according to a third Biden official, it felt “very colonial.”","['Alex Marquardt', 'Zachary Cohen']",en

While US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a deal has been made and that he was “happy” about it, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been more cautious, saying the agreement could be a “big success” - but that it depended on Trump.
A draft of the deal seen by CNN was scant on details and did not include any firm security guarantees for Kyiv.
Here is what we know – and don’t know – about the agreement.
What’s in the deal?
The draft agreement seeks the establishment of a “reconstruction investment fund” that would be jointly managed by the US and Ukrainian governments.
Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Wednesday that Kyiv would be funneling half of the revenues from future state-owned natural resources projects into the fund, with money being reinvested in more developments.
Shmyhal stressed the deal would exclude existing “deposits, facilities, licenses and royalties” tied to Ukraine’s natural resources.
“We are only talking about future licenses, developments and infrastructure,” he said.
The draft agreement goes beyond just minerals and rare earths. It spans Ukraine’s other natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as any infrastructure connected to the sectors, such as ports or LNG terminals.
What does Trump want from the deal?
Trump said at the weekend that he’s “trying to get the money back,” referring to the aid provided to Ukraine under the previous administration.
The US initially demanded a $500 billion share of Ukraine’s rare earths and other minerals in exchange for the aid it has already provided to Kyiv. But Zelensky rejected that idea, saying that agreeing to it would amount to “selling” his country. Trump subsequently called Zelensky “a dictator.”
Zelensky also said that the US was demanding that any future aid would have to be repaid with double the amount: two dollars for every dollar provided. “We’ll need to return $50 billion, but we’ll need to return it with one-to-two ratio. So, we’ll need to return it with 100% loan interest,” he said, adding that he wouldn’t sign a deal that means the next 10 generations of Ukrainians will be indebted.
Asked on Tuesday what Ukraine would receive in the mineral deal, Trump said: “$350 billion and lots of equipment, military equipment, and the right to fight on,” repeating a false claim he has made in the past. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, Washington had committed a total of about $124 billion in aid to Ukraine.
The draft seen by CNN remains vague on whether any money from the fund would be paid to the US. It says that revenues will be reinvested “at last annually to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine,” but adds that it “will also provide for future distributions.”
The draft does not include any concrete figures or details on the size of the stake the US would hold in the fund.
Trump on Wednesday projected confidence that the natural resources deal would come to fruition, saying, “we’ve been able to make a deal where we’re going to get our money back and we’re going to get a lot of money in the future, and I think that’s appropriate.”
“We’re doing very well with Russia-Ukraine. President Zelensky is going to be coming on Friday. It’s now confirmed, and we’re going to be signing an agreement.” Kyiv confirmed Zelensky would meet Trump on Friday.
However, Zelensky said his country will not be repaying money given to it by Washington in the past as part of the deal. “I will not accept (even) 10 cents of debt repayment in this deal. Otherwise, it will be a precedent,” Zelensky said Wednesday at a news conference in Kyiv.
On security guarantees, Trump has said “we’ll be looking to” future security for Ukraine “later on.”
What does Ukraine want from the deal?
Ukraine’s mineral riches have long been eyed by its allies – and Kyiv has made them part of its appeal for support. Zelensky has made it clear he wants security guarantees to be part of the deal.
Some deposits are already in areas that are under Russian occupation and Zelensky has argued that one reason why the West should support Ukraine in its fight against Moscow is to prevent more of these strategically important resources from falling into the Kremlin’s hands.
“The deposits of critical resources in Ukraine, along with Ukraine’s globally important energy and food production potential, are among the key predatory objectives of the Russian Federation in this war. And this is our opportunity for growth,” Zelensky said in October when presenting his “Victory plan.”
Nataliya Katser-Buchkovska, the co-founder of the Ukrainian Sustainable Investment Fund, said that a deal cannot work without security guarantees.
“(For) the US to get access to these deposits, Ukraine must regain control over those territories, demine and rebuild the infrastructure,” she said.
While the draft deal seen by CNN does not specify any security guarantees, it does say that the US “supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.”
Why is Trump so keen on a minerals deal with Ukraine?
Materials such as graphite, lithium, uranium and the 17 chemical elements known as rare earths are critical for economic growth and national security.
They are essential to the production of electronics, clean energy technology, including wind turbines, energy networks and electric vehicles, as well as some weapons systems.
The US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs, many of which come from China, which has long dominated the market.
China is responsible for nearly 90% of global processing of rare earth minerals, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). On top of that, China is also the world’s largest producer of graphite and titanium, and a major processor of lithium.
Experts have long warned that relying on China for strategic materials is risky, but the latest trade tensions between Washington and Beijing make it even more important for the US to look for alternative suppliers.
The US isn’t the only one eyeing Ukraine’s resources. The European Union signed a memorandum of understanding with Ukraine in 2021 outlining future investment opportunities in mineral mining.
A similar document was prepared under the Biden administration last year. It said the US would promote investment opportunities in Ukraine’s mining projects to American companies in exchange for Kyiv creating economic incentives and implementing good business and environmental practices.
How large are Ukraine’s resources?
Trump has repeatedly referred to the deal as one on “rare earths” but it’s likely he was speaking more widely about critical minerals.
Ukraine doesn’t have globally significant reserves of rare earth minerals, but it does have some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals.
But while Ukraine does have large reserves of these minerals, little has been done to develop the sector. Given the huge strain Russia’s unprovoked aggression has put on the Ukrainian economy, it is unlikely that Kyiv would be able to extract these resources without foreign investment.
“⁠Most projects remain in the exploration phase, with no large-scale processing facilities in place,” said Katser-Buchkovska, who served as a member of the Ukrainian Parliament from 2014 to 2019 and was the head of a parliamentary committee on energy security and transition.
“Extracting rare minerals will be extremely expensive and will require years (and) billions of upfront investments, infrastructure development, and workforce training before production can even begin,” she said, adding that Ukraine’s resource extraction sector remains underdeveloped because of outdated infrastructure, war-related damage and lack of investment.
What is Russia saying about this?
Trump’s return to the White House has resulted in a major shift in policy towards Russia.
US and Russian officials meet in Saudi Arabia earlier this month to discuss the end of the war in Ukraine – without inviting Kyiv or any of its European allies to take part.
Trump said on Monday that he was in “serious discussions” with Russia about ending the war and was “trying to do some economic development deals” with Moscow, noting its “massive rare earth” deposits.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that Moscow was ready to work with American companies to mine rare earth mineral deposits in both Russia, and parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine.
“Russia is one of the leading countries when it comes to rare metal reserves. By the way, as for new territories, we are also ready to attract foreign partners – there are certain reserves there too,” Putin said in an interview with Russian state media, referring to Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/europe/ukraine-us-mineral-resources-deal-explained-intl-latam/index.html,What we do and don’t know about Trump’s ‘very big deal’ on Ukraine’s mineral resources,2025-02-12 00:00:00,"The United States and Ukraine are trying to hammer out a natural resources agreement that would give Washington access to Kyiv’s untapped mineral riches in exchange for investment and what Ukraine hopes would be concrete security guarantees.
While US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a deal has been made and that he was “happy” about it, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been more cautious, saying the agreement could be a “big success” - but that it depended on Trump.
A draft of the deal seen by CNN was scant on details and did not include any firm security guarantees for Kyiv.
Here is what we know – and don’t know – about the agreement.
What’s in the deal?
The draft agreement seeks the establishment of a “reconstruction investment fund” that would be jointly managed by the US and Ukrainian governments.
Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Wednesday that Kyiv would be funneling half of the revenues from future state-owned natural resources projects into the fund, with money being reinvested in more developments.
Shmyhal stressed the deal would exclude existing “deposits, facilities, licenses and royalties” tied to Ukraine’s natural resources.
“We are only talking about future licenses, developments and infrastructure,” he said.
The draft agreement goes beyond just minerals and rare earths. It spans Ukraine’s other natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as any infrastructure connected to the sectors, such as ports or LNG terminals.
What does Trump want from the deal?
Trump said at the weekend that he’s “trying to get the money back,” referring to the aid provided to Ukraine under the previous administration.
The US initially demanded a $500 billion share of Ukraine’s rare earths and other minerals in exchange for the aid it has already provided to Kyiv. But Zelensky rejected that idea, saying that agreeing to it would amount to “selling” his country. Trump subsequently called Zelensky “a dictator.”
Zelensky also said that the US was demanding that any future aid would have to be repaid with double the amount: two dollars for every dollar provided. “We’ll need to return $50 billion, but we’ll need to return it with one-to-two ratio. So, we’ll need to return it with 100% loan interest,” he said, adding that he wouldn’t sign a deal that means the next 10 generations of Ukrainians will be indebted.
Asked on Tuesday what Ukraine would receive in the mineral deal, Trump said: “$350 billion and lots of equipment, military equipment, and the right to fight on,” repeating a false claim he has made in the past. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, Washington had committed a total of about $124 billion in aid to Ukraine.
The draft seen by CNN remains vague on whether any money from the fund would be paid to the US. It says that revenues will be reinvested “at last annually to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine,” but adds that it “will also provide for future distributions.”
The draft does not include any concrete figures or details on the size of the stake the US would hold in the fund.
Trump on Wednesday projected confidence that the natural resources deal would come to fruition, saying, “we’ve been able to make a deal where we’re going to get our money back and we’re going to get a lot of money in the future, and I think that’s appropriate.”
“We’re doing very well with Russia-Ukraine. President Zelensky is going to be coming on Friday. It’s now confirmed, and we’re going to be signing an agreement.” Kyiv confirmed Zelensky would meet Trump on Friday.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/asia/ukraine-war-north-korean-troops-russian-ships-hnk-intl/index.html,Ukraine war: Satellite images show how North Korean troops were likely transported to a Russian port,2025-02-27 02:10:05,"Hundreds of North Korean troops were likely transported by sea to Russia to fight in its war against Ukraine, satellite images have revealed, according to a new analysis from a US-based think tank shared exclusively with CNN.
At least two Russian naval ships are believed to have moved North Korean soldiers to a Russian military port in Dunai, in the far east, in October and November, according to researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in California.
The ship transfers were first identified by the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), which said in a press release last year that some soldiers were transported via the North Korean port areas of Chongjin, Hamhung and Musudan. But the South Korean agency only offered a grainy radar image at the time.
“I don’t think that the Russians or the North Koreans want these transfers caught on camera,” Sam Lair, a research associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, told CNN. “The secrecy element is quite remarkable.”
Now, researchers have verified that during the same time period of the troop transfers reported by South Korea intelligence, the Russian vessels identified by the spy agency docked at Dunai port in a remote, eastern part of Russia.
In North Korea, soldiers likely boarded these ships at night, making it difficult to capture evidence of the transfers, researchers said. But satellite images have revealed activities at Dunai, “where it appears the Russians have been less careful.”
For example, in one satellite image from Planet Labs, a crane can be seen extending to one of Russia’s naval landing ships, which researchers believe is the Nikolay Vilkov, at the port on October 17, and a covered cargo truck is on the dock next to it. By October 20, the crane is retracted, and it appears a transfer of soldiers is complete.
Researchers could identify the Russian “Ropucha-class” and “Alligator-class” ships in the satellite images because they match with photos captured by the Japanese Defense Ministry in March 2022, when the vessels passed through Japanese waters.
Each landing ship is believed to have capacity to hold several hundred soldiers, possibly as many as 400, according to the researchers.
Lair explained that Dunai is a secure military facility, making it much more conducive to under-the-radar transfers than the large, nearby port of Vladivostok, which is in an area where civilians live.
“This is an isolated place where they can do these exchanges, where people aren’t going to notice… (where) their own citizens, and folks in the intelligence community might not notice,” Lair said.
An estimated 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been sent to Russia, according to Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports in January, which say around 4,000 of those troops have been killed or injured. Kyiv says it has captured at least two North Korean soldiers. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have confirmed the existence of North Korean troops on the front lines.
CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment.
North Korean troops have been deployed to Kursk since late October to repel Ukraine’s incursion in the southern Russian border region.
“The Russians seem to have been very careful to limit the exposure of the North Korean soldiers, moving them directly to military training facilities. The motive behind all the secrecy surrounding the North Koreans is uncertain, but moving some of them through Dunai would aid in that effort,” Lair wrote in his analysis.
Dunai port has previously been used to transport cargo between Russia and the North Korea since Pyongyang started aiding the invasion of Ukraine in 2023, according to the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.
Satellite images taken in October show a cargo ship being loaded at Rajin port in North Korea, and the same ship docked two days later at Dunai in Russia.
An October 2023 report from the UK-based think tank The Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) said that “Russia has likely begun shipping North Korean munitions at scale” to the “inconspicuous naval facility” tucked away in Dunai.
“We spend a lot of time looking at North Korea in general, because of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, their conventional weapons program, their missile programs… So, we’ve been monitoring the North Korea-Russia connection since it started, in part because we think that that relationship might be going both ways,” Lair said.
Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center think tank in Kyiv, told a forum in South Korea this week that North Korea is gaining valuable combat experience with its involvement in Ukraine.
“It’s not only about supplies of missiles, it’s about testing their missiles in real battlefield conditions,” Getmanchuk said during the forum at the Goethe Institute in Seoul.
She said North Korea has used that experience to upgrade missiles to make them more accurate.
Pyongyang’s ground troops are also getting better, Getmanchuk said.
“They came totally unprepared… Now they are learning very quickly,” adapting to their tactics to be effective in “modern, hi-tech warfare,” she added.
Lair said the Pyongyang-Moscow relationship has deepened since the invasion began. “Sending your own soldiers to fight in someone else’s conflict really suggests the strength of the connection,” he said.
There are indications that Russia and North Korea are no longer using the sea route to transport troops, according to the think tank. Meanwhile, South Korean intelligence has reported that Russian military planes are frequently flying between Vladivostok and Pyongyang.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/europe/ukraine-us-zelensky-trump-rare-earth-security-intl/index.html,Zelensky calls US-Ukraine minerals deal a ‘framework’ as it emerges agreement has no security guarantees,2025-02-26 15:22:03,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky says a proposed deal with the United States on natural resources is a “framework,” and he will want to discuss the countries’ relationship further in person with President Donald Trump, as a draft of the text obtained by CNN shows it does not provide Kyiv explicit security guarantees.
With Trump bent on bringing Russia’s war to a swift end and recouping some of Washington’s financial aid to Kyiv, Zelensky is hoping that the natural resources deal can secure the US president’s future support, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine.
But the draft of the text seen by CNN, current as of Wednesday morning, said only that the United States “supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace,” without making explicit commitments.
At a press conference in Kyiv, Zelensky conceded that the deal does not have “concrete steps on security guarantees” because these need to be decided jointly with the US and Europe.
The Ukrainian president said that the deal could be a “big success,” but emphasized that it only provides a “framework” that can be “part of future security guarantees,” which he hopes to discuss during his anticipated meeting with Trump. CNN reported Tuesday that the US and Ukraine agreed terms on the deal and Zelensky is expected to travel to Washington, DC, in the coming days, according to a Ukrainian official.
The full text of the deal, obtained by CNN, outlined the two countries’ plan to establish a jointly managed “Reconstruction Investment Fund.”
Under the deal, which has spaces for the signatures of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine will contribute to the fund 50% of all revenues earned from the future monetization of state-owned natural resources assets, including hydrocarbons, oil, and natural gas, as well as rare earth minerals.
“For the avoidance of doubt, such future sources of revenues do not include the current sources of revenues which are already part of the general budget revenues of Ukraine,” the draft text reads.
The fund will aim to “attract investments to increase the development, processing, and monetization of all public and private Ukrainian assets,” including its oil and gas and rare earth sectors, the draft text said.
The fund will be managed by representatives of the United States and Ukraine, and “more detailed terms pertaining to the Fund’s governance and operation will be set forth in a subsequent agreement” to be negotiated after the initial deal is signed, according to the draft.
Many Ukrainians have been unsettled by reports that Kyiv is set to grant Washington access to Ukraine’s natural resources, while the Trump administration has been vague about what it will offer in return.
Oleksandra Zdorenko, a pensioner, told CNN Ukrainians were “outraged” when the US first proposed the deal, demanding a $500 billion share of Ukraine’s rare earths and other minerals, which Zelensky rejected, saying this would amount to “selling” his country.
“We didn’t understand how they could even offer us such a deal. Now it seems to me that some of the conditions have changed,” Zdorenko said. “I fully trust our government and our president. So much has already been done for Ukraine that they will not do anything to harm it now.”
At a press conference in Kyiv on Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Zelensky would not sign “or even consider any enslaving or colonial treaties that would not take into account the interests” of Ukraine, saying that the draft agreement lays the foundation for Ukraine’s “future recovery.”
Ukraine ‘grateful’ for US support
Zelensky also said in the press conference that Ukraine will not repay money given to it by the US as part of the natural resources deal.
“I will not accept [even] 10 cents of debt repayment in this deal. Otherwise, it will be a precedent,” he said Wednesday.
Trump had said over the weekend that he is “trying to get the money back” that the Biden administration had given to Ukraine to help it repel Russia’s invasion. Trump falsely claimed that the US has given Ukraine $350 billion since February 2022. The actual figure is around $120 billion, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
Trump also falsely claimed that Europe’s support for Ukraine was “in the form of a loan.”
“They get their money back. We gave it in the form of nothing. So I want them to give us something for all of the money that we’ve put up,” Trump said, saying the US had been made to feel “stupid.”
When Trump repeated this claim during talks with Emmanuel Macron on Monday, the French president grabbed Trump’s arm to correct him.
“No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort. It was like the US: loans, guarantees, grants,” Macron said.
Speaking Wednesday, Zelensky said Ukraine remained “grateful” for US support, but that he will be “very direct” and ask Trump “if the United States will stop support [for Ukraine] or not.”
If the US does not provide more aid, Zelensky said Ukraine could “buy weapons directly” from the US, suggesting that frozen Russian assets – amounting to some $300 billion – could be used to fund the purchases.","['Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Gul Tuysuz', 'Nick Paton Walsh', 'Christian Edwards']",en

Negotiations have been ongoing for days over a deal that could grant the US access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals as part of wider negotiations to end Russia’s invasion, as well as US involvement in a reconstruction fund for Ukraine.
The Ukrainian official said the terms were agreed after “everything unacceptable was taken out of the text and it is now more clearly spelt out how this agreement will contribute to Ukraine’s security and peace.”
Details of the agreement are not yet known, but a major sticking point had been a demand from the Trump administration to a $500 billion share of Ukraine’s rare earths and other minerals in exchange for the aid the US had already provided Kyiv, which was previously rejected by Zelensky.
The US has not confirmed whether the terms of a deal have been agreed.
“I hear that (Zelensky is) coming on Friday. Certainly it’s OK with me if he’d like to, and he would like to sign it together with me. And I understand that’s a big deal, very big deal,” US President Donald Trump said from the Oval Office on Tuesday.
Asked what Ukraine would receive in the mineral deal, Trump said: “$350 billion and lots of equipment, military equipment, and the right to fight on.”
“We’ve pretty much negotiated our deal on rare earth and various other things,” Trump told reporters, adding that “we’ll be looking to” future security for Ukraine “later on.”
“I don’t think that’s going to be a problem,” Trump said. “I spoke with Russia about it. They didn’t seem to have a problem with it. So I think they understand … once we do this, they’re not going back in.”
Ukraine has been pushing for security guarantees, with Kyiv not only keen to see the return of lost territory but protection against a possible future Russian invasion.
European leaders have also stressed the necessity for security guarantees for Ukraine as a condition for any future peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Following his meeting with Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday proposed boosting Ukraine’s military capabilities, and – if requested – to deploy British and French troops to keep the peace.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will visit the White House on Thursday, has said a US “backstop” is needed for any Ukraine peace deal, which could potentially include security guarantees, American intelligence cooperation, air support and heavy lift transport.
News of an agreement came after the same source told CNN the Americans had resisted security guarantees being included in the draft.
The precise wording regarding Ukraine’s security in the latest draft was unclear.
CNN reported Monday, citing a Ukrainian source familiar with the negotiations, that some of the thornier details about the resources deal would be negotiated in subsequent talks, and that the US and Ukrainian presidents might discuss the security guarantees in person.
A source told CNN at the weekend that Zelensky could not accept an earlier version of the deal because it contained no American “obligations” while Ukraine was “expected to provide everything.”
Since then, there have been signs the two leaders were edging closer to an agreement.
During a visit to the White House on Monday, Macron commended Trump for his “decision to work with President Zelensky, and to conclude this agreement that’s so important for the US and Ukraine on rare earths, critical minerals.”
Meanwhile, Russia has continued to bombard Ukraine with airstrikes, firing at least 177 drones at the country overnight into Wednesday, according to Ukraine’s air force. Of these, 110 were shot down and 66 did not reach their targets, the air force said.
At least seven people were killed in the overnight attacks, including two in Kyiv region, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.","['Victoria Butenko', 'Nick Paton Walsh', 'Gul Tuysuz']",en

News of an agreement came after the same source told CNN the Americans had resisted security guarantees being included in the draft.
The precise wording regarding Ukraine’s security in the latest draft was unclear.
CNN reported Monday, citing a Ukrainian source familiar with the negotiations, that some of the thornier details about the resources deal would be negotiated in subsequent talks, and that the US and Ukrainian presidents might discuss the security guarantees in person.
A source told CNN at the weekend that Zelensky could not accept an earlier version of the deal because it contained no American “obligations” while Ukraine was “expected to provide everything.”
Since then, there have been signs the two leaders were edging closer to an agreement.
During a visit to the White House on Monday, Macron commended Trump for his “decision to work with President Zelensky, and to conclude this agreement that’s so important for the US and Ukraine on rare earths, critical minerals.”
Meanwhile, Russia has continued to bombard Ukraine with airstrikes, firing at least 177 drones at the country overnight into Wednesday, according to Ukraine’s air force. Of these, 110 were shot down and 66 did not reach their targets, the air force said.
At least seven people were killed in the overnight attacks, including two in Kyiv region, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.","['Victoria Butenko', 'Nick Paton Walsh', 'Gul Tuysuz']",en

Loath to condemn Kremlin aggression on Monday’s third anniversary of the brutal onslaught on Ukraine, the United States chose new voting buddies at the United Nations, including longtime enemies Russia and North Korea.
The drama at UN headquarters better reflected the gaping new transatlantic rift than the scenes in the White House as Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron clasped hands and ladled out mutual flattery.
This was not the only jarring juxtaposition on a day of diplomatic drama stretching from Kyiv to Moscow, from London to Washington and New York as global powers jockey for position in the global great game suddenly shaken up by Trump.
Say one thing for the American president — his craving for a one-on-one summit with his friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, has unleashed a torrent of crisis diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine that was frozen for years.
But his mind-boggling turn toward Putin and away from Ukraine has scrambled old alliances and set off a race by America’s allies and adversaries to shape the peace deal he plans to conclude with the Russian leader.
Europe heaps pressure on Russia while the US does the same on Ukraine
On the anniversary of the invasion, world leaders took the train into wartime Kyiv to stand with President Volodymyr Zelensky — fresh from being lambasted by Trump. They included Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who could commiserate with his host after Trump insulted him again Monday as the “Governor” of the supposed 51st state.
In London, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will follow Macron’s bid to redirect Trump with his own White House trip on Thursday, said the G7 should take on “more risk” to hurt Russia as he announced a new raft of sanctions. But Trump wants Russia back in the rich nations’ club.
In Moscow, Putin condemned European leaders whom he suggested were too close to Ukraine to help broker peace while dispensing the kind of praise that Trump laps up when he said the president was free from such “shackles.”
Behind the diplomatic theater is a common theme: Leaders know that Trump is desperate for a “deal” to bolster his reputation and worry that in his quest for political adulation at home and an elusive Nobel peace prize, the US president isn’t particular about the details.
“I mean, that’s what I do. I do deals. My whole life is deals. That’s all I know, is deals. And I know when somebody wants to make it and when somebody doesn’t,” Trump said at a news conference with Macron on Monday.
Trump’s subordinates endlessly lionize him for almost super-human prowess at the bargaining table. “He’s the dealmaker in chief. He’s the commander in chief. And it’s only because of his strength that we’re even in this position,” national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Fox Business on Sunday, for example.
The best thing that can be said for the president’s unorthodox approach is that he has offered the possibility of ending a war that is grinding through the lives of young Ukrainian and Russian soldiers and has killed thousands of civilians.
And if he succeeds in inking an agreement with Ukraine to exploit its rare earth metals and minerals — a big if, considering Kyiv refused his previous pillaging demands — he will create a future economic lifeline for the country as it rebuilds and forge a reason for his administration and others to stay engaged.
And no one can say the president isn’t acting on the “America First” promises that convinced many voters to give him a second term.
His administration’s brutalist new approach to Europe has got results. France and Britain are offering to send a “reassurance” force to Ukraine after a peace deal and NATO states look like they will at last start significantly increasing defense spending.
But Ukraine — and for that matter Gaza, which Trump wants to turn into the “Riviera of the Middle East” after sending the Palestinians somewhere else — isn’t a real estate deal.
Peacemaking involves human lives, history’s animosities and complex calculations, including the existential question of whether Ukraine will survive and what a Putin “win” would mean for future European security. There’s no comparison to the branding deals and acquisitions that Trump swung for casinos, golf clubs and skyscrapers during his checkered career as a property developer.
And European concerns were only exacerbated in Monday’s joint news conference with Macron when Trump displayed his apparently limited interest and understanding of how a peace deal without security guarantees could reward Putin’s land grab and lay the groundwork for future wars. The president instead incessantly complained that the invasion would never have happened if he had been in office.
Macron turns on the charm
Macron used his extensive repertoire of compliments, tactile body language and handshakes that never seemed to end on “Dear Donald.” And he even got away with correcting him in the Oval Office over his false claims that Washington had almost doubled Europe’s support for Ukraine.
After visiting the White House, Macron sought out another venue to get to Trump — Fox News, telling Bret Baier, “I think the arrival of President Trump is a game changer. And I think he has the deterrence capacity of the US to re-engage with Russia … my concern is that we have to go fast. But we need something first, a truce, which could be assessed, and checked, and full-fledged negotiation.”
Earlier, after turning to Trump at the White House, Macron said: “We want peace; he wants peace. We want peace swiftly, but we don’t want an agreement that is weak.” The French and the British want security guarantees for Ukraine that they argue can only be reinforced by an American “backstop” if Russia is to be prevented from restarting the war.
“The fact that there are Europeans that are ready to engage to provide for these security guarantees and now there’s a clear American message that the US, as an ally, is ready to provide that solidarity for that approach — that’s a turning point,” Macron said. “And that is one of the great areas of progress that we’ve made during this trip.”
But how far “solidarity” goes is unclear since Trump refused to publicly offer US help. Perhaps he doesn’t want to anger Putin before their eventual summit. Or maybe he worries about a possible clash between US and Russian forces if American troops were part of those security guarantees.
Despite Macron’s claims of progress, Trump still views the war through a different lens – as events at the UN showed.
The US delegation voted with some of its most sworn adversaries, including regimes in Moscow and Pyongyang, against a General Assembly resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for the return of Kyiv’s territories.
Later, Russia and the US voted together again on a Security Council resolution drafted by Washington that did not highlight Moscow’s aggression but that called for a swift end to the war and a lasting peace.
The US resolution passed 10-0 in the Security Council. But several top US allies, including permanent five members France and Britain, abstained. Both countries offered amendments to Washington’s resolution seeking to insert references to the United Nations Charter and Ukraine’s territorial integrity, a European diplomat said. But Russia vetoed them both. “Russia continues to trample on international law and the United Nations Charter by pursuing its aggression against Ukraine,” the diplomat said.
This estrangement between Washington and allies it has protected since World War II was laid bare in the Oval Office when Trump was asked whether Putin, who has killed and imprisoned his opponents, was a “dictator.”
“I don’t use those words lightly,” Trump said days after applying the title to democratically elected Zelensky.
This drew a crooked Gallic grin and a sideways glance from Macron. But it also summed up his enormous task.",['Stephen Collinson'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/politics/us-joins-russia-ukraine-un-vote/index.html,US joins Russia to vote against UN resolution condemning Russia’s war against Ukraine,2025-02-24 17:55:10,"The United States joined Russia to vote against a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia’s war against Ukraine Monday in a stunning shift from years of US policy.
The vote against the Ukrainian and European-backed resolution saw the US at odds with its longtime European allies and instead aligned with the aggressor in the war on the three-year anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The US again voted the same way as Russia later Monday on a US-proposed UN Security Council resolution that did not call the Kremlin the aggressor or acknowledge Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The resolution passed without the support of five European members of the Security Council.
The US’ shocking alignment with Russia at the United Nations came as the Trump administration has pursued discussions with Moscow about ending the war. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. European partners have rushed to adjust to the shift in US policy and French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House Monday.
The European-backed General Assembly resolution was adopted with 93 votes in favor. It notes “with concern the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has persisted for three years and continues to have devastating and long-lasting consequences not only for Ukraine, but also for other regions and global stability” and “calls for a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine.”
It also demands that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.”
The US had introduced a rival General Assembly resolution, which did not call Russia the aggressor or acknowledge Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
It “implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.” It mourns “the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict” and reiterates “the principal purpose of the United Nations, as expressed in the United Nations Charter, is to maintain international peace and security and to peacefully settle disputes.”
The US introduced the same resolution at the Security Council. It passed with 10 votes in favor, including from Russia, and five abstentions after European efforts to delay the meeting failed. Proposed amendments to strengthen the language, which were added to the US General Assembly resolution, did not pass in the Security Council due to vetoes from Russia.
Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya commended the brief, three-paragraph US resolution as a starting point for future efforts toward a peaceful settlement.
“The text we passed is not an ideal one, but in essence, it is a first attempt to have a constructive and future-oriented product by the Council which is talking about the path to peace, rather than blowing the conflict up,” he said.
US charge d’affaires Dorothy Shea called the resolution’s passage the Security Council’s first action “to firmly call for an end to the conflict.”
“This resolution puts us on the path to peace. It is a first step, but a crucial one, one of which we should all be proud now we must use it to build a peaceful future for Ukraine, Russia and the international community,” she said after the vote.
However, Shea’s European counterparts had strong words in response to its passage.
“There will be no peace and security anywhere if aggressions are rewarded, and if the law of the jungle wins,” French Ambassador to the UN Nicolas de Rivière said.
“No one wants peace more than Ukraine, but the terms of that peace matter,” UK Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward said. “Only a just peace, one that honors the terms of our charter, will endure.”
“And the terms of the peace must send a message that aggression does not pay. This is why there can be no equivalence between Russia and Ukraine in how this council refers to this war,” she said. “If we are to find a path to sustainable peace, the Council must be clear on the war’s origins. We also owe it to the people of Ukraine, who have suffered so much.”
“Russia chose to launch a war of aggression against a sovereign state, but again, today, is seeking to obfuscate that fact,” Woodward said.
“What, how and on what terms this war ends can only be decided by negotiations with Ukraine. No peace will be sustainable without Ukraine’s consent,” she said.
Earlier in the day at the General Assembly, Shea had urged member states to back the US resolution and said the US “cannot support Ukraine’s resolution, and we urge its withdrawal in favor of a strong statement committing us to end the war and work towards a lasting peace.”
The US ended up abstaining on the vote for its own resolution at the General Assembly after several amendments were passed ahead of the vote to strengthen the language against Russia and reaffirm Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

He stressed repeatedly the necessity of security guarantees to ensure Moscow keeps its promises this time around, and said any agreement must be “checked and verified.” And he recounted his own conversations with Vladimir Putin, saying there was value in talking to the Russian leader but only from a position of strength.
“We want peace. He wants peace,” Macron said of his US counterpart as he stood next to Trump. “We want peace, peace swiftly, but we don’t want an agreement that is weak.”
“This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,” he said.
Trump, meanwhile, offered no mention of security guarantees when it was his turn to speak at Monday’s joint news conference. Instead, he portrayed himself as a master negotiator in search of a deal.
“I’ve spoken to President Putin, and my people are dealing with him constantly, and his people in particular, and they want to do something,” he said from the East Room. “I mean, that’s what I do. I do deals. My whole life is deals. That’s all I know, is deals. And I know when somebody wants to make it and when somebody doesn’t.”
Macron had hoped to use his yearslong interpersonal relationship with Trump to press Europe and Ukraine’s case after a week of serious deterioration in transatlantic ties. And the men did seem friendly, trading kind words and smiles throughout their hours together. Trump lavished praise on Macron for overseeing the swift rebuilding of Paris’ Notre-Dame cathedral after a fire almost destroyed it.
Macron also sought to emphasize areas of agreement. Reiterating a stance he has held for months, he acknowledged Europeans must shoulder more responsibility for their own security, a stance on which the French leader is aligned in principle with Trump.
But their differences were still rather obvious, and by the end of the day it did not appear Trump had moved significantly from his positions on who was responsible for the Ukraine war or whether Europe had done enough to support Kyiv.
As the two leaders met Monday, a US-led resolution that did not call Russia the aggressor in the war passed in the UN Security Council with support from Moscow and without the backing of the US’ European allies.
And in an extraordinary moment that underscored the strained dynamics of Monday’s talks between the French and American presidents, Macron attempted to correct his US counterpart on the nature of European support for Ukraine, interrupting Trump as he was speaking to suggest he was misstating the facts.
“Just so you understand, Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine. They’re getting their money back,” Trump began as he was preparing to make the case for a new deal to secure Ukraine’s mineral revenues.
That is when Macron reached over to grab Trump’s arm to interject.
“No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort. It was like the US: loans, guarantees, grants,” he said, as Trump smiled ruefully.
Trump did voice openness to a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, a plan he’s expected to learn more about later this week when he receives the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He even said he’d discussed the idea with Putin, and that the Russian president was also open to the idea.
Later, Macron described Europeans as acting as an “assurance force” in Ukraine, with Americans acting “in solidarity,” though it was clear the precise contours of the plan still need to be worked out.
Trump also said he was prepared to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky soon to finalize a deal that would allow US access to Ukraine’s mineral revenues, a development Macron welcomed.
“It looks like we’re getting very close,” Trump said.
The president was adamant that the Ukraine war could end within weeks, would not call Putin a dictator — a word he’s used to describe Ukraine’s leader — and reiterated his goal to visit Moscow at some point in the future.
A tense backdrop to Virtual G7 meeting
Even before Trump and Macron sat down for their formal talks, they had already spent more than two hours together for a virtual meeting of the Group of 7. Both beamed in from the Oval Office, Trump behind his desk and Macron next to him, for the call marking the third anniversary of the Ukraine war.
The G7 meeting came against a tense backdrop. Ahead of the talks, US officials had resisted inclusion of a reference to “Russian aggression” in a final leaders’ statement. Trump has also renewed his push to allow Russia to rejoin the group, reviving an argument he had in 2019 with Macron and other leaders at the summit the French president was hosting in Biarritz.
After Monday morning’s meeting, however, both men suggested the two-hour virtual summit went well. Departing the West Wing on foot, Macron called the talks “perfect.”
For the French leader, whose complicated history with Trump dates to 2017, Monday’s meetings were intended to employ what he believes is a unique rapport with the American president in order to advocate Ukraine and Europe’s case.
Macron said somewhat hopefully last week he thought Trump viewed him with high regard.
“He is someone I respect,” Macron said, “who I believe respects me.”
How much that matters in Monday’s talks wasn’t entirely clear.
Ahead of the meeting, Trump bemoaned what he said were lackluster efforts by both Macron and Starmer to end the war, insisting they “haven’t done anything,” despite significant contributions from both countries to Ukraine’s war effort.
Macron had already used his position to press Trump on support for Ukraine, arranging a surprise three-way meeting in Paris last December with himself, Trump and Zelensky around the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. Trump was respectful and “in listening mode” during the meeting, one official said, as Zelensky laid out the necessity of security guarantees for Ukraine once the war ends.
Macron tried explaining to Trump that Putin had changed since the US president was last in office. And he warned that if Ukraine was defeated, the US could look weak to its other rivals — namely, China.
Two months later, those talks do not appear to have left a lasting impression on Trump, who in the past week has lashed out at Zelensky and suggested it was Ukraine that started the war.
Starmer, who meets Trump on Thursday, is expected to brief his US counterpart on an emerging plan to deploy as many as 30,000 European peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, hoping to demonstrate Europe’s commitment to shouldering more of the burden for the country’s security going forward. He may also reveal the date by which he wants the United Kingdom to raise defense spending to 2.5% of the GDP.

The leaders of Europe’s two nuclear powers are rushing to the White House to try to reclaim a central role for themselves and for Ukraine after they were cut out of US-Russia talks on ending the war.
President Donald Trump sent shock waves through the transatlantic alliance last week and played into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hands while attacking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and trashing the truth about how the war started.
French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Trump on Monday — the third anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign democracy, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians and left Putin and his forces accused of war crimes.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will follow on Thursday, in the most treacherous moment yet of his young premiership, with large gaps opening between Washington and London on the reality of Ukraine’s plight.
Britain and France are drawing up plans for a European “reassurance force,” perhaps including up to 30,000 troops that could deploy to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. The idea, however, faces massive barriers — not least that a deal that both Zelensky and Putin could agree to sign seems highly unlikely. And Starmer has already warned that the force couldn’t work without a US “backstop,” which could potentially include security guarantees, American intelligence cooperation, air support and heavy lift transport. A key takeaway this week will be whether Trump has any interest given Russia’s opposition to NATO troops in Ukraine under any flag.
As Trump leads the US in a new direction on Ukraine, historic schisms are opening that threaten the transatlantic alliance and the post-World War II order. Trump treats America’s longtime friends — who have failed to deliver on calls by successive presidents to spend more on defense — as adversaries. And the new administration has already shattered years of European assumptions about America’s security guarantees to the West.
The president’s siding with Putin over Zelensky — and his bid to extract a punitive deal to export Ukraine’s rare earth minerals as a payback for past US aid — shocked transatlantic allies. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s warning in Brussels this month that Europe must take primary responsibility for its own security called into question NATO’s creed of mutual defense. And Vice President JD Vance’s slam of European governments and values in a speech in Munich was seen in Europe as an attempt to destabilize continental leaders on behalf of far-right populists who take ideological inspiration from the MAGA movement.
In an extraordinary comment that captured the historic times, the likely next leader of Germany Friedrich Merz, leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union that won Sunday’s general election, according to exit polls, set out the new government’s program.
“My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” Merz said at a televised roundtable after the exit polls also showed huge gains for the extreme-right AfD party.
“I would never have believed that I would have to say something like that on television. But at the very least, after Donald Trump’s statements last week, it is clear that the Americans — at least this part of the Americans in this administration — are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,” Merz said.
‘We came very, very close to signing something’
Trump appears to be aiming for a lightning-fast peace agreement — similar to the velocity of his domestic transformation a month after his return to the White House.
His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who has a leading role in the Ukraine talks, on Sunday raised the prospect of a swift breakthrough following the meeting between US and Russian officials last week. “We came very, very close to signing something. And I think we will be using that framework as a guidepost to get a peace deal done between Ukraine and Russia,” Witkoff told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
He added: “The president understands how to get deals done. Deals only work when they’re good for all the parties. And that’s the pathway that we’re on here.”
Hegseth implied Sunday that Trump’s depiction of Zelensky as a “dictator” last week was meant to avoid annoying Putin in order to get concessions at the negotiating table. “Standing here and saying, ‘you’re good, you’re bad, you’re a dictator, you’re not a dictator, you invaded, you didn’t’ — it’s not useful. It’s not productive,” Hegseth said on “Fox News Sunday.”
But Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, accused Trump of “surrendering” to Putin. “This is not a statesman or a diplomat. This is just someone who admires Putin, does not believe in the struggle of the Ukrainians, and is committed to cozying up to an autocrat.” The Rhode Island Democrat added on ABC’s “This Week”: “Putin will not stop in Ukraine. He will begin in a campaign, both clandestine and in many cases overt, to undermine the other governments in Eastern Europe and it’ll create chaos.”
Trump’s turn against Ukraine and his rush to embrace Putin ahead of a potential summit in the coming weeks has Ukrainians and Europeans fearing that he simply plans to seal a deal with Russia and then impose it on Kyiv. That’s why Macron and Starmer will try to convince the president he will look bad if he fails to drive a hard bargain with Putin.
“What I am going to do is that I am going to tell him basically, you cannot be weak in the face of President Putin. It’s not you, it’s not your trademark,” Macron said, paraphrasing his message to Trump in a social media Q&A on Thursday.
An Elysée Palace official said that Macron shared Trump’s goal of ending Russia’s war of aggression and was bringing proposals that were reaffirmed in his talks with European leaders, particularly with the British. “He is traveling to Washington with this goal in mind, sharing this desire to end the conflict while making every effort to maintain our support for Ukraine, strengthen European security and ensure that Ukraine is fully involved in these efforts, and to ensure that Ukraine’s interests — which are ours as well — are fully taken into account.”
Starmer on Sunday laid out a tough pro-Zelensky approach, which conflicted with Trump’s position, a day after talking to the Ukrainian leader on the phone. “Nobody wants the bloodshed to continue. Nobody, least of all the Ukrainians,” Starmer said at the Scottish Labour Party conference in Glasgow. “But after everything that they have suffered, after everything that they have fought for, there could be no discussion about Ukraine without Ukraine, and the people of Ukraine must have a long-term secure future.”
The phrase “no discussion about Ukraine without Ukraine” encapsulated the principles of the Biden administration’s tight coordination with Europe and Kyiv over the war. But that consensus has been buckled by Trump. And Starmer will risk further angering the president before he arrives. Bridget Phillipson, a British Cabinet minister, told Sky News on Sunday that the UK government would unveil a new set of sanctions against Russia on Monday.
Trump says that Zelensky — a hero in the west for leading Ukraine’s resistance to Russia — didn’t deserve to be at the talks. “I’ve been watching for years, and I’ve been watching him negotiate with no cards. He has no cards. And you get sick of it,” Trump said on Fox News Radio’s “The Brian Kilmeade Show” Friday.
Trump also criticized his visitors. “You know, they haven’t done anything,” he told Kilmeade. “You know, Macron’s a friend of mine, and I met with the prime minister, and you know, he’s a very nice guy, but nobody’s done anything,” Trump said.
Macron may try to correct Trump on that point, one person familiar with the matter said. But the French president is most intent on managing the way forward, providing his view on how Europe can help assure Ukraine’s security, as long as it is incorporated into talks to end the war.
Starmer: The US is ‘right’ to complain about European defense spending
The French and British leaders will also arrive in Washington as Trump demands steep hikes in defense spending by NATO members, which would mean excruciating fiscal choices for governments saddled by constricted public finances. Both Macron and Starmer have spoken of the need for European nations to do more to protect the continent, but their capacity to act is likely to fall far short of the American president’s expectations.
Despite Starmer saying Sunday that Trump was “right” in calling for Europe to step up, Phillipson declined to say, for instance, whether her boss would tell Trump a target date for his government to raise defense spending to 2.5% of GDP. The US president has demanded 5%.
Both Macron and Starmer, who spoke by telephone Sunday, are expected to argue that Washington’s continued presence in Europe and security guarantees are critical to peace in the west, despite the Trump administration’s desire to pivot to the challenge posed by China.
The European message is going to be a tough sell to a transactional president who doesn’t appreciate alliances as a force multiplier for American power and who seems to prefer the company of autocrats to that of his fellow democratic leaders.
Macron has already tried to shape Trump’s thinking on Ukraine, arranging a three-way meeting with the then-US president-elect and Zelensky in Paris last December. Trump was respectful and “in listening mode” during the meeting, one official said, as Zelensky laid out the necessity of security guarantees for Ukraine once the war ends. Macron tried to impress on Trump that Putin had changed since he was last in office and warned that if Ukraine was defeated, the US could look weak to its other rivals — namely China.
But two months later, the talks do not appear to have left a lasting impression on Trump, given his comments of the last week. And European officials acknowledge it will be impossible to persuade Trump to abandon his erroneous views of the war, including that it was provoked by Ukraine or that the United States was conned into supporting a man he claims is a dictator.
Instead, they say, it will be more useful to look ahead, as Trump prepares to sit down soon with Putin and the contours of a possible peace agreement emerge.","['Stephen Collinson', 'Kevin Liptak']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/22/europe/rare-earth-minerals-us-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Draft US-Ukraine rare earth minerals deal not one Zelensky would accept, source says",2025-02-22 13:21:35,"A draft deal between the United States and Ukraine over rare earth minerals and other natural resources is “not the one President Zelensky would accept,” according to a source familiar with the negotiations.
“It is a strange offer to try and take from a country that is a victim of war, more than it cost to pay for its defence,” the source told CNN.
The US is trying to gain access to Ukraine’s critical minerals and other resources as part of wider negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. In return, Ukraine has been pushing for security guarantees, with Kyiv not only keen to see the return of lost territory but protection against a possible future Russian invasion.
Ukraine was not invited to talks between the US and Russia in Saudi Arabia and this week President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump have been locked in an escalating war of words.
Trump falsely accused Zelensky of starting the Ukraine war, while the Ukrainian leader hit back, saying the US president lives in a “disinformation space.”
Ukrainians are still trying to negotiate amendments to the deal because the current draft “does not foresee any American obligations while Ukraine is expected to provide everything,” the source said.
The source spoke after an official in the Ukrainian Presidential Administration told Ukrainian state broadcaster Suspilne that there would be no signing of the agreement on rare earth metals Saturday.
Work had continued on the document “all night” but was held up by the issue of “security guarantees,” Suspilne reported.
The continued Ukrainian resistance to signing the deal in its current form comes after days of intense pressure from the Trump administration, whose National Security Advisor Mike Waltz even highlighted the case of an aluminium mine that could meet all the US’s annual needs if refurbished with American investment.
Such a deal would reduce US dependency on China, and provide significant incentive for the United States to boost Ukrainian security, a US official familiar with negotiations told CNN.
“The draft deal provides America with financial guarantees and therefore security guarantees for Ukraine,” said the official, casting the controversial potential agreement as a reason for the United States to be invested in Ukrainian defense.
“Our countries are more aligned as a result and America will receive access to critical materials, materials we won’t have to rely on China for,” the official said. “Once resources start flowing, America will have even more incentive to protect Ukraine.”
The official described the role of Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, as instrumental in getting the deal this far down the track.
Also on Saturday Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, posted that he had spoken with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio “to continue the results-oriented Ukraine-US dialogue.”
“Ahead of the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale aggression, I underscored Ukraine’s strong will to achieve a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace — one that will strengthen Ukraine and the US.”","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Victoria Butenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/22/politics/ukraine-war-us-proposes-un-resolution/index.html,US proposes its own UN resolution marking anniversary of war in Ukraine after refusing to back European statement,2024-12-11 00:00:00,"The United States has proposed its own United Nations resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia’s war in Ukraine after refusing to back one drafted by Kyiv and backed by Europe.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio described it as “a simple, historic resolution … that we urge all member states to support in order to chart a path to peace,” in a statement released late Friday.
The draft US resolution, seen by CNN, does not condemn Russia as the aggressor in the conflict, nor does it make any acknowledgement of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
“This resolution is consistent with President Trump’s view that the UN must return to its founding purpose, as enshrined in the UN Charter, to maintain international peace and security, including through the peaceful settlement of disputes,” Rubio’s statement said.
“If the United Nations is truly committed to its original purpose, we must acknowledge that while challenges may arise, the goal of lasting peace remains achievable,” the top US diplomat said. “Through support of this resolution, we affirm that this conflict is awful, that the UN can help end it, and that peace is possible.”
The resolution comes as President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his antagonism toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and as Europeans and Ukrainians fear they will be sidelined as the US moves forward on negotiations with Russia.
It also comes after Rubio spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on Friday “to reaffirm President Trump’s commitment to ending the conflict in Ukraine, including through effective action in the United Nations Security Council,” according to State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce.
The draft US resolution is brief. It mourns “the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict” and reiterates ”the principal purpose of the United Nations, as expressed in the United Nations Charter, is to maintain international peace and security and to peacefully settle disputes.”
The draft resolution “implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.”
The Ukraine-drafted resolution, meanwhile, refers to “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation” and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions “adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.”
A diplomatic back-and-forth is also underway among Group of Seven members over a joint statement marking the third anniversary of the war, with the United States resisting a reference to “Russian aggression” in the document, CNN previously reported.
US and Russian officials met for key talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, earlier this week, in what the US delegation suggested would be the first in a series of meetings to bring the war to an end.
Following the talks, Rubio said that the US and Russia would appoint high-level teams to negotiate the end of the war in Ukraine and that they were working to reestablish diplomatic channels. He said “concessions” will have to be made by “all sides” for the conflict to end.
Russia has previously demanded that Ukraine must cede control of large swaths of its territory and give up its ambition to join NATO — conditions Kyiv rejected, while Zelensky has said he will not accept any deal made in Ukraine’s absence.
Following the meeting, Trump on Tuesday wrongly accused Ukraine of starting the conflict and parroted another Moscow talking point in saying the Ukrainian president should hold an election that was suspended because his country is in a state of war.
The public war of words escalated after Zelensky accused Trump of repeating Russian disinformation, leading to Trump labeling his Ukrainian counterpart a “dictator without elections” and blaming him for strong-arming the US into spending hundreds of billions of dollars “to go into a War that couldn’t be won.”
The attacks came as the US president has made it clear he wants the war to end as soon as possible — even if it means further territorial losses for Ukraine. Trump raised eyebrows last week when he opted to hold a 90-minute phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin before speaking to Zelensky.
The announcement that Washington and Moscow would begin in-person talks sparked panic in Ukraine and amid Kyiv’s Western allies. European leaders held an emergency summit on Monday, reiterating that no peace talks can happen without Ukraine and its European allies having a seat at the table.
Earlier this month, Trump suggested the US should get access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in exchange for aid. Zelensky said Tuesday that the US has asked Ukraine to “give away” 50% of its rare minerals without offering any security guarantees in exchange. He rejected that idea, saying: “I cannot sell our state.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/politics/trump-ukraine-mineral-deal-analysis/index.html,The Ukraine minerals deal is a perfect metaphor for Trump’s foreign policy,2025-02-21 05:00:46,"Donald Trump isn’t the only president who knows a bad deal when he sees one.
Volodymyr Zelensky’s refusal to sign away nearly half of his country’s rare earth minerals for very few future guarantees is one of many reasons why Trump has been driven into a rage at his counterpart in Kyiv.
The Ukrainian president has made clear that exploiting his country’s precious geographical and energy resources will be one way to rebuild its economy and cities after the eventual end of the war. But the offer tendered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, while being lauded by US officials as a generous ladder to prosperity for Ukraine, is not really a “deal” at all.
However, it provides insights into Trump’s view of foreign policy and his perception of the war after he reversed, rhetorically at least, the Biden administration’s support for the invaded party and threw his weight behind the invader.
As with his plan to relocate all Palestinians out of Gaza so the US can build a “riviera” of beach resorts, the president’s motives appear to be rooted more in extracting the best potential monetary return for the United States than in equitably solving a murderous conflict that endangers the world. Trump is reflecting skepticism among his base voters toward the tens of billions of dollars of military and financial aid that the Biden administration sent to Ukraine after it was illegally invaded by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces three years ago. But Trump’s transactional approach represents a shattering of foreign policy values pursued by the United States for decades, including the principle that mighty nations should not invade smaller ones, which Washington enshrined in the United Nations charter.
His pressure on Ukraine, the victim in the conflict, is also a hardline effort to take advantage of a nation in its darkest hour. While Putin has carved off large chunks of its territory, Trump seeks a large slice of its mineral wealth at a knockdown price. The “deal” looks rather like a form of extortion that Trump tried on Zelensky once before — floating military aid as an incentive for him to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, which led to Trump’s first impeachment.
Still, the White House says Zelensky has no choice but to sign the pact to pay back US taxpayers for Kyiv’s lifeline — even though it contains no assurances that Washington will keep the aid coming in the future.
“President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelensky,” White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Thursday. “The fact that he hasn’t come to the table, that he hasn’t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered – I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly.”
A staggering US reversal
The clash over the rare earth minerals agreement comes amid a serious deterioration of US relations with Zelensky, driven by Trump’s adoption of Russian propaganda on the war, including the false charges that the Ukrainian leader started the conflict and that he is a dictator. The autocrat in this situation is Putin, who has run Russia for 25 years, imprisoned his opponents, crushed the free press and held sham elections. And he started the war.
The staggering US reversal on the war deepened Thursday as the Trump administration haggled with G7 members over a joint statement marking the invasion’s third anniversary, with US diplomats resisting a mention of “Russian aggression” in the document. Officials told CNN that other G7 members fear handing Russia yet another win, following the US siding with Putin over some of his demands on an eventual peace before this week’s talks in Saudi Arabia.
While Trump says he is convinced that Putin wants to stop the war and is serious about talking peace, US and allied intelligence agencies are less bullish. Three sources familiar with Western intelligence told CNN’s Katie Bo Lillis and Natasha Bertrand that Putin remains fixated on either subsuming Ukraine into Russia or ensuring a small, weak state that is dependent on Moscow. “If you were to get a ceasefire, then a ceasefire is just time for Putin to take a rest and rearm and come back and get the rest of what he wants,” said one of the sources. “We’ve seen no indications whatsoever that his ambitions have changed.”
The events of the last few days, which have left Ukrainians feeling betrayed, US allies alarmed, and even some Republican senators outraged, have renewed debate about Trump’s motives and how they will influence the chances of a fair peace deal.
Is the president being driven by personal animosity toward Zelensky? Or contempt for a smaller nation in need, as he seeks to reorient US foreign policy to promote a spheres of influence system controlled at superpower summits by strongmen like himself, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping?
Or is Trump, as he often has before, choosing a hardline position simply to create negotiating room for himself? Could his adoption of many of Putin’s talking points and leaning hard on Zelensky be designed to lure the Russian president to the table for a tough bargaining session? Certainly, Trump’s good relationship with Putin could position him, more than any other Western leader, to influence Russia’s conduct and potentially extract concessions.
A peace that endures; permits Ukraine to continue existing as independent, sovereign state; avoids rewarding Putin’s expansionism; and saves millions of lives would be a huge legacy achievement for Trump. The current war of words between Washington and Kyiv does not preclude an eventual and serious negotiation — and will soon be forgotten if a peace can be brokered. Still, Trump is yet to show evidence that he’s drafting a clever plan to call the Kremlin’s bluff. Trump’s wild words often cause his critics to overreact, but words are important in this case — since the president is obscuring the basic facts about what caused the war, which is a fundamental flaw in a leader who is positioning himself to lead peace negotiations.
Trump’s parroting of many of Putin’s positions has also renewed debate about his fascination with the Russian leader, which, in his first term, saw him publicly repudiate his own intelligence agencies’ assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 election.
Trump’s latest favoritism toward Putin drew a raw public and emotional rebuke from a key Republican senator facing reelection in 2026. North Carolina’s Thom Tillis said he agreed with most of the president’s instincts on national security but added: “Whoever believes that there is any space for Vladimir Putin and the future of a stable globe, better go to Ukraine, they better go to Europe.” Tillis went on about Putin: “They better invest the time to understand that this man is a cancer and the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime. And it will be a cancer that spreads into the South China Sea, into Taiwan and metastasized across the globe.”
Why Zelensky couldn’t accept the ‘deal’
The proposed minerals deal raises questions not just about its terms but also the White House’s understanding of the political dynamics in Ukraine.
There’s no way that Zelensky or any other Ukrainian president could have accepted the “deal” to hand over much of his country’s geological inheritance and a key to its future economic viability. If he had, his approval rating probably would tumble near to the 4% level that Trump falsely claims it’s already at as he demands that Zelensky hold an election, which has been delayed because of martial law amid Russian attacks. Appreciating Zelensky’s political situation is crucial, because any peace is going to be a painful pill that the Ukrainian leader will have to convince his country to swallow since it is almost certain to enshrine Russia’s hold on stolen territory.
Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference last weekend that he’d not allowed one of his ministers to sign the first draft of the minerals deal with the United States. “The agreement is not ready to protect us or our interests,” he told reporters, noting that he did not see how the draft provided security guarantees for Ukraine.
But it’s still possible that the first US attempt at a deal could provide the framework for a future agreement. Zelensky hasn’t, for example, ruled out an agreement. But he is seeking to use the leverage of his country’s resources to obtain the security guarantees that Ukraine needs to survive after any peace deal.
The original rare earth mineral deal focused on compensating the United States for past aid to Kyiv, and specified the natural resources that would form part of the deal on over a dozen pages, two sources familiar with the document told CNN. Zelensky said Wednesday the contract asked for the US to own, or receive revenue from, 50% of Ukraine rare earth mineral mining and other natural resource sectors. The sources said the document said it asked for compensation not for future US assistance to Ukraine, but for previous aid.
Speaking on Fox News on Thursday morning, Waltz said it was time to for Ukraine to stop “bad-mouthing” Trump because of all the good he and the United States had done for the country. “It’s unacceptable. They need to tone it down and take a hard look and sign that deal,” he said.
While Ukraine’s language has been spicy in recent days — Zelensky accused the US president of dwelling in a “disinformation space” — most of the heightened rhetoric followed Trump’s own false claims and accusations.
In the United States and Europe, the furor provoked by Trump’s turn against Ukraine is a political issue. But for Ukrainians it’s a matter of life and death.
“Ukrainians feel like they are the only adults left in the room,” Sasha Dovzhyk, director of the Institute for Documentation and Exchange, told Paula Newton on CNN International. “What we have currently in the news is tantrums from someone we considered a world leader, and Ukrainians are basically left to face up to the deconstruction of the world order.”
She added: “We are not new to this fight; the only addition is that currently we are facing aggression and misinformation from another side — which is the side of our great ally the United States of America.”",['Stephen Collinson'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/us-resisting-adding-reference-to-russian-aggression-to-g7-ukraine-anniversary-statement/index.html,G7 Ukraine anniversary statement: US resisting including reference to ‘Russian aggression’,2025-02-20 21:52:18,"A diplomatic back-and-forth is underway among Group of Seven members over a joint statement marking the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the United States resisting a reference to “Russian aggression” in the document.
The dispute, described by two Western officials familiar with the matter, reflects the larger shift in approach from the White House to the conflict. President Donald Trump has blamed the war on Ukraine, and likened its wartime president to a “dictator.”
That stands in stark contrast to how the Biden administration, along with its allies in the G7, have described the war over the last three years.
The group is set to convene virtually next week around Monday’s anniversary of the invasion, but resistance from Washington over pinning blame on Russia for the conflict is threatening Western resolve as the war enters its fourth year.
“Russian aggression” has been used in G7 statements dating back to the start of the conflict, as has the descriptor of the conflict as an “illegal war of aggression.” The bloc has acted as something of a steering committee for marshaling assistance to Kyiv.
Now, envoys from Washington have voiced concern over how the war is framed in the document, the officials said. Trump has also suggested Russia be allowed to rejoin the G7 after it was ejected for annexing Crimea in 2014.
The officials said the US was resisting language assigning blame on Russia for the war, but that other nations in the group have been adamant that any softening of the statement would amount to a win for Moscow.
“The talks are still happening,” one of the officials said, “but there is a lot of concern at equivocating who is responsible for the war.”
The Financial Times first reported on the continued talks.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment, but in a press briefing Thursday, US national security adviser Mike Waltz said the president remained angry at Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, a day after he accused him of being a dictator.
“President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelenskyy,” he said. “The fact that he hasn’t come to the table, that he hasn’t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered – I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly. But President Trump, as we made clear to our Russian counterparts and I want to make clear today, he’s focused on stopping the fighting and moving forward.”
Trump has insisted on multiple occasions this week that it is Ukraine, not Russia, that is responsible for the conflict.
“Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won,” he wrote on social media Wednesday.
Other Western leaders have quickly distanced themselves from that sentiment. French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump at the White House on Monday, said he would warn his US counterpart “not to be weak in the face” of Putin.
“I know Donald Trump. For four years, we were [both] in charge already during my first term. So he is someone I respect, who I believe respects me,” Macron said.
“I’m going to say to [Trump], ‘Deep down you can’t be weak in the face of Putin, it’s not you, it’s not your trademark,” the French president continued.
He said later that he’d spoken to Zelensky for a second day in a row to coordinate his upcoming visit to Washington.
In Kyiv on Thursday, Trump’s envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Gen. Keith Kellogg, met with Zelensky to discuss US-led efforts to end the war. He was there, in part, to convince Zelensky to agree to American proposals that would provide the US mineral revenues from Ukraine as payment for past assistance.
Zelensky’s refusal to accept the plan angered the White House. Trump’s aides accused the Ukrainian leader of not being appreciative enough for American support.
“There needs to be a deep appreciation for what the American people, what the American taxpayer, what President Trump did in his first term, and what we’ve done since,” Waltz said. “So some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, frankly, and insults to President Trump, were unacceptable.”",['Kevin Liptak'],en

Europe’s leaders and officials have been blindsided by a staggering collapse in American support for Ukraine in the past week. Many still cannot understand why US President Donald Trump has turned so furiously on Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, parroting the vitriolic disinformation usually heard from the Kremlin.
Leaders on the continent weren’t part of the Russia-US talks this week. They don’t know when the US will present a proposed peace deal to Kyiv, or make good on its threat to turn its back on the conflict. And they don’t know what will happen next.
“The way in which this was delivered – blow after blow after blow, within days – that was a real shock” for the continent, said Armida van Rij, a senior research fellow and head of the Europe Programme at London-based think tank Chatham House.
European politicians are working through their grief. A frantic summit in Paris sparked a raft of hawkish new ideas, aimed at framing the contours of an uncertain new reality.
But still, key capitals are adrift in their aims. A peacekeeping force, hiked defense spending and new military aid have all been put forward, but never in chorus. Europe’s scattershot intentions formed one half of a stunning split-screen this week; on the other side were the US and Russia, suddenly chummy, tossing Ukrainian demands and territories off the negotiating table.
The emergence of a leader might help, some experts say: A figurehead who can corral Europe behind a universal intention, building a bridge between Kyiv and Washington. Britain’s Keir Starmer and France’s Emmanuel Macron are the most obvious candidates, and both will visit DC next week, trips that have taken on outsized importance.
But Europe is not known for its unity on defense, and every major leader has electoral or economic headaches at home. Plus, there is the thorny issue of when, and how hard, to push back on Trump; governments know that rupturing that relationship might play into Moscow’s hands.
And so, the questions persist. “We do not want to fracture our relationship with America,” British defense analyst Nicholas Drummond told CNN. “But what do you do when your closest ally gets into bed with your worst enemy?”
Boots on the ground
Europe expected Trump to be less interested in Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty than the previous Biden administration, but it wasn’t primed for a break-up so sudden, unequivocal and bitter.
The sight of a sitting US president blaming an adversary’s invasion on its besieged ally was staggering, and drew unified condemnation from European leaders. On an emotional level, as well as a practical one, Europe has been shellshocked.
But it should not have been. For months, Trump and his inner circle had demurred and speculated over the start and hypothetical end of the war in Ukraine, and displayed an indifference to Kyiv’s sovereignty that signaled a jarring shift in policy was coming.
From the moment of Trump’s election victory, van Rij said, “European heads of government should have been getting together … to figure out what the European plan was going to be. But that hasn’t really happened.” Instead, it waited until now to act with real urgency.
Two futures exist: one with a peace deal, and one without. But either would likely require European leadership; Trump’s administration has made clear its priorities lie in the Indo-Pacific and on its own borders.
UK Prime Minister Starmer made the first significant move to jostle European governments behind a common goal, announcing this week a marked shift in policy: Britain would be ready to put boots on the ground to keep an agreed peace in Ukraine.
Western officials said Wednesday that such a force would likely number fewer than 30,000 troops, and would focus on “reassurance,” securing key Ukrainian infrastructure and working to instill confidence in the state.
The officials said the effort is being led by Britain and France. Paris first mooted putting boots on the ground last year but was roundly rebuffed by Europe. But Starmer has made clear that an American “backstop” would be key; the officials said such a backstop would likely be focused around air power, and be controlled from a NATO country like Poland or Romania.
Starmer and Macron will be expected to pitch Trump on those plans in Washington next week.
But there are many unanswered questions – if NATO soldiers are attacked by Russian on Ukraine’s non-NATO soil, for example, what level of response would it draw?
And Starmer, who oversees a creaking military that has reduced in size since wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, would need buy-in from Europe, too. “The British Army is suffering from the cumulative effects of 40 years of decline,” Drummond said.
“It will be very difficult for the military in our current situation,” admitted an MP from the governing Labour party, who has pushed the government to go beyond its planned hike to military spending, which stands at 2.3% of GDP but is set to rise to 2.5% in the coming years. “My sense is we can cope, but it is in dire need of investment for the modern battlefield,” the lawmaker told CNN.
A painful split
Putting boots on the ground is not a universally popular idea. Importantly, Poland – which boasts NATO’s largest military in Europe and is a significant player in Ukraine – is reluctant, fearing it would make its own borders more vulnerable.
Should an informal, smaller European leadership group take shape, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk will likely expect to be involved. He will come to the table with uncomfortable truths for larger nations like Britain, France and Germany about the amount they are putting towards defense.
And Germany is in line for a particularly harsh dressing down. An inconveniently timed election on Sunday could result in weeks of haggling over its next government. The probably incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, used last week’s Munich Security Conference to set out a hawkish position on Ukraine.
But German military spending stands around a paltry 1.5%; Merz says it needs to be raised, but has avoided firm commitments. Russia’s war has already limited Germany’s voice in Europe on defense issues – Berlin spent decades forging closer economic ties with Moscow, despite Poland’s protestations – and Merz will struggle to regain it.
In any case, a glaring possibility exists that a peace deal, agreed by the US and Russia, is rejected by Zelensky, or that Putin doesn’t agree to peacekeepers. Europe’s support would then become essential, if Ukraine is to keep up a difficult war without an end date.
That means more than words; Europe will need to fill a gap in military aid too.
Western officials said this week that Kyiv likely has received enough military supplies to last until the summer.
“Biden got a lot of kit in before the inauguration. Kit is still going in” one said. But losing American contributions would be a big blow: the official said there is a “difference in quality” between America’s supplies and Europe’s.
Sorting through the pieces of the break-up of a decades-long security relationship with America would be painful and complicated work. But Europe has realized this week that it may be necessary.
“The US is walking away from 70 years of cooperation,” another British lawmaker told CNN this week. “It remains a key pillar of NATO and I’m hopeful this will stand through time; but it needs to remain clear eyed as to its adversaries and its allies.”",['Rob Picheta'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/business/trump-ukraine-western-companies-return-russia-intl/index.html,Will Western companies return to Russia as Trump seeks a deal with Putin?,2022-06-08 00:00:00,"One of the many questions raised by discussions between Moscow and Washington on ending the war in Ukraine is whether the corporate exodus from Russia in opposition to the February 2022 invasion may be reversed.
As long as broad Western sanctions on Russia remain in place, that looks unlikely, but should US President Donald Trump’s administration seek to ease restrictions, it could open the door for some companies to return to what was once a high-growth market.
Here is a rundown of the situation.
Who exited and how?
More than a thousand companies from McDonald’s (MCD) to Mercedes-Benz have left Russia in the last three years by selling, handing the keys to existing managers or abandoning assets. Others like Danone and Carlsberg had their assets seized and a sale forced through.
Western companies have acknowledged losses totaling $107 billion, including lost revenue, according to a Reuters analysis in March 2024. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, says US companies have lost $324 billion by leaving Russia.
When exiting, companies such as McDonald’s, Renault and Henkel agreed options to buy the assets back. France’s Renault sold its majority stake in Russian carmaker Avtovaz in May 2022 for reportedly just one ruble, but with a six-year option to buy it back.
Some food and healthcare companies, including Procter & Gamble (PG), PepsiCo (PEP) and Mondelez (MDLZ), say they stayed on humanitarian grounds to continue supplying Russian consumers with basic goods.
What kind of companies may return first?
After the highest-level US-Russian meeting since the start of the Ukraine war began this week, Dmitriev said, without giving further details, that he expects a number of US
companies to return as early as the second quarter.
The most likely to return are those operating outside sanctions, such as retailers and food producers, rather than those in sectors such as energy and finance.
Dmitriev said he believed major US oil companies that had been successful in Russia would “at some point” return.
Senior Russian lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov this week said he thought Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) would soon restore payment services. The two companies said their Russia suspensions remained in place.
Why would companies not return?
Hundreds of Western companies including Carlsberg and Unilever (UL) issued statements condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in the days and weeks after the invasion, framing their exit from the country or suspension of operations in moral terms.
Should a deal be reached that rewards Russia with Ukrainian territory, companies that have criticized Moscow risk reputational damage by returning.
What sectors are off limits?
Companies involved in supplying goods that have both civilian and military applications are bound by Western restrictions.
Boeing (BA) and Airbus, for example, halted the supply of planes and spare parts to Russia. Other examples include semiconductors, telecoms equipment and electronics. Speculation is rife on whether the US-Russia talks could yield a softening of sanctions, but no concrete proposals have yet been made.
Meanwhile, the European Union agreed Wednesday the 16th package of anti-Russia sanctions.
Sanctions prohibit providing Russia with financial or energy-related services, and Russian officials’ statements that they expect Western companies to return look for now like wishful thinking.
How has the Russian market changed?
Some of the world’s most popular brands from Starbucks (SBUX) to Ikea and Levi’s (LEVI) have been replaced by Russian imitations. The more than 800 McDonald’s restaurants in Russia now operate under the brand Vkusno & tochka (Tasty & that’s it). Starbucks sold its business to restaurateur Anton Pinskiy and rapper Timati. The business is now known as Stars Coffee.
Recapturing the market may be particularly hard for Western carmakers, as Chinese competitors have gained a more than 50% market share, up from less than 10% three years ago. It is not clear how willing Russia would be to support the return of European carmakers at the expense of Chinese ones, especially given the “no-limits partnership” between Moscow and Beijing as trade between the two countries has ballooned.
Would Western companies be welcome?
Moscow has long promised to retaliate for what it views as the theft of Russian assets abroad, and has seized companies in Russia through presidential decrees and the courts.
Russia currently controls a handful of Western companies through the guise of “temporary management” and is ramping up asset seizures from companies with foreign ownership links. Most companies exiting Russia were forced to sell at huge discounts. Convincing investors to dip their toes back into the Russian market may take time.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/trump-zelensky-rift-ukraine-war/index.html,Inside the 48 hours that Trump turned on Zelensky,2025-02-20 00:00:00,"As the long-fraught relationship between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky ripped apart Wednesday, a question that lingered among allies of both men was whether the fight would dash hopes for a US-brokered peace — or, potentially, help it along.
Firing off an angry message on his social media platform, Trump labeled Zelensky a “dictator without elections,” blaming him for strong-arming the United States into spending hundreds of billions of dollars “to go into a War that couldn’t be won.”
It turned into a daylong series of taunts, which Trump amplified during a speech Wednesday night in Miami, where he declared: “Zelensky better move faster. He’s not going to have a country left.”
Both accusations parroted Moscow’s own irony-laden talking points about the war and Ukraine’s president, who declared martial law at the onset of Russia’s invasion, which prevented scheduled elections.
Trump’s post was hardly an isolated attack. For years, Trump has viewed Zelensky skeptically, questioning his decisions and — in an episode made famous during Trump’s first impeachment — pressing him to open an investigation into his then-rival Joe Biden.
Trump has taken to weaving his criticism of Biden and Zelensky together, suggesting Wednesday night that the Ukrainian president was on a “gravy train” with US assistance during the Biden administration.
“If you would have had (Biden’s) administration for another year,” Trump said Wednesday night, “you would have been in World War III and it’s not going to happen now.”
Lately, however, Trump’s aides have been closely monitoring Zelensky’s public statements — in particular his criticism of the US excluding Ukraine from talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia this week — with mounting agitation.
Their frustration had been growing before Wednesday, sources said. But it boiled over after Zelensky told reporters at his office in Kyiv that Trump was living in a “web of disinformation.”
Trump privately told aides who were with him in Florida that he wanted to respond directly, which led to his Truth Social post, an official traveling with Trump said. He delivered the diplomatic missile on the way to his golf club in Miami and expanded on his remarks before an audience of hundreds at the evening investment conference in Miami sponsored by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, which hosted talks earlier in the week between US and Russian officials.
“It’s a frustration. There is a strong and legitimate feeling that this brutal war has to stop and that this pathway is being diminished through Zelensky’s public statements,” a second White House official told CNN.
In Zelensky’s view, however, the end to the war Trump is envisioning looks a lot like what Russia has been asking for. Already, members of Trump’s administration have ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv and said US troops would not help guarantee Ukraine’s security when the war ends.
For those reasons, he says he can’t help but speak out.
For months, Zelensky had carefully sought to avoid a full rupture with his temperamental new counterpart in Washington. He arranged a meeting in the weeks ahead of last year’s election meant to allay some of the then-GOP nominee’s skepticism about US involvement in the war.
The men emerged at the start of the discussion at Trump Tower in Manhattan to demonstrate their willingness to get along. Trump said he had a “very good relationship” with the Ukrainian leader — but that he also enjoyed a “very good relationship” with his adversary in Moscow, Vladimir Putin.
“I hope we have more good relations,” Zelensky interjected.
“But, you know, it takes two to tango,” Trump replied.
At the time, the exchange hardly registered. Five months later, it appears to foretell the remarkable rift that is emerging just as Trump looks to sit down with Putin in Saudi Arabia.
Signaling a shift in American policy
Few foreign leaders have been immune to Trump’s mood swings, which during his first term led to scrapped overseas trips, phone calls ended abruptly when Trump hung up, and the imposition of tough new tariffs.
Yet until now, Trump’s frustrations hadn’t seemed to signal such a wholesale shift in American foreign policy, away from the United States’ longstanding allies in Europe and toward the Kremlin.
Many of Trump’s allies said Zelensky should have seen Trump’s wrath coming.
“The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president’s mind by badmouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,” Vance told The Daily Mail.
In explaining Trump’s striking public statements, White House officials have insisted his primary – in fact, only – objective is to end the three-year conflict in Ukraine, which he believes was woefully mismanaged by the previous administration.
Insisting upon a settlement to the war, they say, is long overdue after years of grinding conflict. Trump himself has appeared almost agnostic on the precise contours of the settlement that would end the war: “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed, killed,” he said last week.
Yet how he achieves that objective while castigating Zelensky and aligning himself with Russian talking points isn’t clear.
Trump’s Republican allies in Washington suggested Wednesday the president may have a grand plan in mind.
”What I’m in support of is a peaceful outcome and result in Ukraine,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said when asked if he had concerns about the president’s rhetoric about Ukraine. Thune said he believed Trump and his team are working to achieve peace and “right now, you’ve got to give them some space.”
Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, said Trump is “always positioning for something,” adding that he suspected Trump might be “positioning for a negotiation” with Putin through his comments about Zelensky.
Still, Trump will require buy-in from Zelensky if any negotiated end to the conflict is successful. And if he is serious about keeping American troops out of the conflict, he’ll need European allies to step up with their own peacekeeping troops — a step some nations have already offered.
Some Trump advisers and allies do see a strategy in the bluster. A Trump loyalist who has spoken to the president in Florida in recent days said one reason behind Trump’s lashing out at Ukraine is to scare Europe into ponying up more to defend Ukraine.
“See, there’s a method to the madness,” the person said, pointing to a report that Denmark had pledged to boost spending on arms.
A Trump advisor echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, telling CNN: “If other European countries are half as responsive as Denmark, then that’s a massive win.”
Writing on X, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson — who maintained close ties with Trump during his first term — rebutted most of Trump’s claims but said his former counterpart was driving a larger point.
“When are we Europeans going to stop being scandalised about Donald Trump and start helping him to end this war?” Johnson wrote. “Of course Ukraine didn’t start the war. You might as well say that America attacked Japan at Pearl Harbor. Of course a country undergoing a violent invasion should not be staging elections. There was no general election in the UK from 1935 to 1945. Of course Zelenskyy’s ratings are not 4%. They are actually about the same as Trump’s.”
“Trump’s statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action,” he went on.
Indeed, hastily arranged conferences of European leaders in Paris this week hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron suggested Trump’s words were being taken very seriously.
“Russia poses an existential threat to Europeans,” Macron said in an interview with French regional newspapers. “Do not think that the unthinkable cannot happen, including the worst.”
At the same time, Macron is not giving up on Trump entirely. He will be in Washington next week for a meeting, as will British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has said he would be willing to send troops to act as peacekeepers in Ukraine.
Both men spoke to Zelensky on Wednesday following Trump’s insults.
“The Prime Minister expressed his support for President Zelenskyy as Ukraine’s democratically elected leader and said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II,” Downing Street said afterward.
Trump is increasingly casting himself in the role of peacemaker – no matter the cost – overlooking the frayed western alliances and the upending of US foreign policy.
“We’re successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia, something all admit that only Trump is going to be able to do,” Trump said Wednesday night, speaking about himself again and again in the third person.
“In the Trump administration, we’re going to be able to do it. I think Putin even admitted that.”","['Kevin Liptak', 'Jeff Zeleny', 'Alayna Treene']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/europe/zelensky-trump-reaction-intl/index.html,Trump calls Zelensky ‘a dictator’ after Ukraine’s leader accuses him of living in ‘disinformation space’,2025-02-19 10:50:06,"US President Donald Trump falsely called Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky “a dictator,” escalating a public war of words between the two leaders that started when Trump falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war with Russia.
Trump’s accusation, posted on his social media network Truth Social, came just hours after Zelensky accused him of repeating Russian disinformation.
Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, Zelensky pushed back on several unfounded claims the US president made on Tuesday, while reinforcing Ukraine’s position that a deal to end the war needed its involvement.
“Unfortunately, President Trump – I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us – unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,” Zelensky said.
Trump has made it clear he wants the war to end as soon as possible – even if it means further territorial losses for Ukraine. And much to the horror of Kyiv and its allies, Trump has at times adopted Kremlin’s narrative and blamed Ukraine and NATO for the conflict, even saying that Ukraine “may be Russian some day.”
But Trump’s boosting of Russia goes well beyond rhetoric. The president raised many eyebrows last week when opting to hold a 90-minute phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin before speaking to Zelensky.
Then on Tuesday, US and Russian officials held high-level talks on ending the war in Ukraine in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, excluding Kyiv from the meeting.
Putin praised this new US attitude towards his country. Speaking about the talks in Riyadh, Putin said he was told the atmosphere was “friendly.”
“There were completely different people on the American side, who were open to the negotiation process without any bias, without any condemnation of what had been done in the past,” Putin added.
The US and Russia agreed in Riyadh to appoint high-level teams to negotiate the end of the war and said they were working to reestablish diplomatic channels.
Zelensky reiterated on Tuesday Ukraine was not happy with the exclusion, saying that while any country has the right to discuss bilateral issues, the fact that the US held direct talks with Russia “helped Putin out of his long isolation.”
The US was one of Ukraine’s closest allies under the Biden administration, providing the country with tens of billions worth of military aid. But Trump has made it clear that he thinks the US should no longer send aid to Ukraine without getting anything in return.
Earlier this month, he suggested the US should get access to Ukraine’s mineral richest in exchange for aid. Zelensky said on Tuesday that the US has asked Ukraine to “give away” 50% of its rare minerals, without offering any security guarantees in exchange. He said he rejected that idea, saying: “I cannot, I cannot sell our state.”
Late Wednesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered his support to Zelensky “as Ukraine’s democratically elected leader,” following Trump’s barb, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was “simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelensky democratic legitimacy.”
Zelensky later posted to X that he appreciated the UK’s support, and said his country would “never forget the respect the British people have shown for Ukraine and our citizens.”
Trump repeats false claims
It was Kyiv’s initial complaint about being shut out of the talks that sparked Trump’s tirade of falsehoods on Tuesday.
Speaking late on Tuesday, Trump said: “Today I heard, ‘Oh well, we weren’t invited. Well, you been there for three years. You should’ve ended it after three years. You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal.”
The incorrect claim that Ukraine somehow started the war has long been repeated by the Kremlin and its supporters. The conflict began in 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula, and began sponsoring pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Moscow then launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, attacking its smaller neighbor at night, sending tanks across the border, bombing Ukrainian cities and sending special forces into Kyiv to assassinate Zelensky.
But Trump did not stop at questioning who started the war in Ukraine. Repeating another line often pushed by the Kremlin, Trump appeared to question Zelensky’s legitimacy.
“We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort, incorrectly claiming that Zelensky’s approval rating was “at 4%.”
Zelensky won more than 73% of the vote in the second round of the 2019 presidential election. While his mandate was meant to end last May, a new election was not held because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of the country. The martial law prohibits elections.
A Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer had spoken to Zelensky on Wednesday evening and told him “it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II.”
Speaking on Wednesday, Zelensky specifically said the claim that his approval rating was at 4% comes from Russia, and that Kyiv has some evidence that the numbers were discussed between the US and Russia.
He referred to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) earlier this month which showed that while his popularity dropped significantly since the early days of the war, his approval rate has never dropped below 50% and currently stands at 57%.
Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation Mykhailo Fedorov went even further, pointing out on Telegram that Zelensky’s current approval ratings are higher than those of Trump.
Trump and Zelensky’s relationship has been fraught since Trump’s first term in office when he pressured Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in a phone call. That call led to Trump’s first impeachment.
Trump earns Kremlin’s praise
Trump’s comments sparked outrage across Ukraine, with some people saying the US president is not to be trusted.
Speaking to CNN in central Kyiv, psychologist Valeria Valevska said Trump was “very wrong.”
“I believe that Trump is a narcissist, he is very unpredictable, and Ukrainians cannot trust him or count on his support at all. I don’t like Trump’s policies, and I think most Ukrainians and Europeans don’t either,” she said.
Meanwhile, pensioner Oleksandr Mykhailov told CNN he believed Trump “obviously doesn’t understand what he is talking about.”
“If this continues, Europe must intervene and set its own conditions. Because wherever America has stepped in, they have done damage and then left, as they did in Afghanistan, Iraq, and so on,” Mykhailov added.
Trump’s comments were well received in Moscow, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praising the US president for echoing the Kremlin’s narrative, telling the Russian parliament, the Duma, that Trump seemingly “understands our position.”
“Trump, I think, is the first Western leader to publicly and openly say that the cause of the Ukrainian conflict was the efforts of the previous administration to expand NATO,” Lavrov told lawmakers on Wednesday. “No Western leader has actually said that before. So that is already a signal that he understands our position.”
Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that Moscow would be “very pleased” with the early results of its “successful charm offensive” on the Trump administration.
“I think (the) Russians feel very confident and very happy that, deal or no deal, they are getting what they want. The fact that ‘Team Ukraine’ is no longer the same as ‘Team US’ is amusing Putin a lot,” Gabuev told CNN.
Meanwhile, Russia continues its brutal assault on Ukraine, inching ahead along the eastern front lines and attacking from the air. Moscow launched a massive drone attack against multiple Ukrainian cities on Tuesday, just hours before the meeting in Riyadh. Despite the assault, the talks went ahead as planned.
Russia has long argued that the eastward expansion of NATO put its security under threat, falsely claiming that NATO leaders promised Russia that the defensive alliance would not enlarge after the end of the Cold War. NATO has always had an open door policy with any European state welcome to join as long as it meets the entry criteria.
Ukraine deepened its cooperation with NATO after Russia first started attacking it in 2014.
Putin used the NATO argument to justify his invasion of Ukraine, even claiming, falsely, that NATO troops were fighting in Ukraine.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Kostya Gak', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/europe/analysis-trump-zelensky-dictator-intl-latam/index.html,"As Trump’s attacks on Zelensky turn personal, there’s only one winner: Russia",2025-02-19 00:00:00,"The suspicion this was personal always lingered. But there was hope the greater good of both the US and Ukraine would win out.
The past 24 hours has seen US President Donald Trump’s slow-burn, apparent dislike for his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, belch out into the open. And with it comes a real and new uncertainty about the future of Ukraine, and more widely the security of Europe.
Last week, Trump hinted he felt Zelensky’s poll numbers were low and he would have to face elections, but Tuesday night he dug deeper, falsely stating the wartime leader was at 4 per cent favorability and Ukraine had started the war.
This is pretty close to Kremlin talking points. Moscow has been at pains to incorrectly suggest Ukraine’s imminent joining of NATO was behind its unprovoked attack in 2022, and that Zelensky is illegitimate as Ukraine has not undertaken the immense challenge of running elections in wartime.
Zelensky has for months flattered Trump as one who can bring peace through strength. Kyiv knew the Trump team’s rhetoric on the campaign trail spelt a likely sea change for Ukraine, but held out hope, with European allies, that Trump would seek to avoid a Kabul Airport Moment of collapse in security on the continent, and keep Russia back.
In the background, lingered the risk their contentious relationship in Trump’s first term – when Zelensky didn’t give Trump what he wanted in a “perfect” phone call that led to impeachment – was a dark, inescapable cloud that would hang over their future interactions. Now that cloud has loudly broken and Ukraine is getting wet.
Zelensky has tempered his remarks about Trump living in a “disinformation space” by adding he has great respect for this US president and the American people. But Trump sought no such caveats, even adding the “dictator” needed to move fast to save Ukraine and was on a “gravy train.”
Twice in five days this White House has dubbed European democratic leaders tyrants, falsely, while declining to mention the Kremlin’s authoritarian record in the same speech. US Vice President JD Vance at the weekend in Munich said Europe’s most democratic US allies were afraid of their voters. Now Trump says Russia’s greatest adversary is himself a “dictator” on the make. Putin’s army of propagandists are being outwritten on Pennsylvania Avenue.
The existential dilemma now for Ukraine is whether it even has the luxury of choice between its wartime president and its main military backer, the United States. Is enough left intact of either?
Zelensky is now the subject of withering posts by the world’s most powerful man, who is parroting a regular supply of Kremlin talking points stemming from somewhere yet unknown, altering the course of the largest war in Europe since the 1940s.
The Trump administration’s financial support for Ukraine – without which its survival is truly in doubt – is now endangered. Trump has repeatedly referred – falsely – to how Ukraine’s aid is “MISSING,” and somehow that Zelensky is on a “gravy train.” He is preparing a narrative for the American people that probably ends in the aid itself being curtailed.
So why doesn’t Zelensky, who has spent half of his six years in power fighting a war he did not initially believe was going to happen, just call a vote and be done with talk of his legitimacy? Elections in Ukraine have been tough in the past two decades, even in peacetime. Russia has sought to meddle, in 2004 stealing the vote and sparking huge protests that unseated its proxy candidate who stole the vote.
In wartime, elections are suspended during martial law. A ceasefire, proposed also by Trump’s team, could lead to this being suspended, and allowing soldiers to vote. But what of the millions of Ukrainians abroad as refugees? What of the electoral reform and emergency legislation needed for a legitimate, modern vote? Should it be rushed to get a quick result, or labored over to reach the full, gold standards of international legitimacy? What if a Russian drone assault or missiles derail the voting day? Everything could go wrong and almost certainly will.
The result would irrevocably be shrouded in doubt, further damaging the mandate Zelensky is falsely accused of lacking, or empowering an alternative who would also lack full legitimacy. It would sow chaos on the front lines, at the kitchen tables and in the coffee shops of Kyiv, and in the Ukrainian diaspora around Europe. This is exactly what the Kremlin wants: political torment to add to Kyiv’s woes across the front line.
It is becoming harder to divine Trump’s motives. You cannot bluff when it comes to geopolitical security and NATO; your opponents will hear weakness in an alliance, and not fear you more as you strike a hard negotiating pose against your own allies. You cannot force a flawed peace upon a country fearing for the survival of its own borders and people. You cannot undermine a wartime leader and not expect his troops to also falter on the front lines. Only one strategic interest has been served by Trump’s radical rewriting of the global order in the past fortnight. And it is that of the one adversary NATO was founded to confront.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trumps-lies-about-zelensky-and-ukraine/index.html,Fact check: Trump’s barrage of lies about Zelensky and Ukraine,2025-02-19 20:39:47,"President Donald Trump is on a lying spree about Ukraine.
In remarks to reporters on Tuesday and in a social media post on Wednesday, Trump made numerous false claims about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Russian war on Ukraine – some of which echoed inaccurate talking points from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Here is a fact check of some of his assertions.
Who started the war
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump dismissed Ukraine’s complaints about its exclusion from US-Russia talks on ending the war – and falsely said of Ukraine: “You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal.”
Ukraine did not start the war. Russia started the war by invading Ukraine in 2022. Trump’s own former vice president, Mike Pence, and several Republican lawmakers have noted this obvious fact in the wake of Trump’s lie.
Zelensky’s approval rating
In the same Tuesday remarks, Trump called for a new Ukrainian election – last year’s previously scheduled presidential election was called off because the country is under martial law – and falsely claimed Zelensky is “down at 4% percent approval rating.”
That 4% figure is not even close to accurate.
The latest survey from a leading Ukrainian pollster, conducted earlier this month, found that 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelensky. That was up from 52% in December – and 52% was Zelensky’s lowest wartime figure in this series of trust surveys. In addition, an approval survey conducted from late November to early January found 63% of Ukrainians either approved fully or tended to approve of Zelensky’s actions as president.
US wartime aid to Ukraine
In the Wednesday social media post, Trump falsely claimed that Zelensky “talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars” to “go into” an unwinnable war.
The $350 billion figure, too, is far from reality.
According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, the US had committed a total of about $124 billion in military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between late January 2022, just before the Russian invasion, and the end of December 2024; the think tank found the US had actually allocated about $119 billion.
It’s possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump’s “$350 billion” figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the Ukraine response has said on its website that “as of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion, with $130.1 billion obligated and $86.7 billion disbursed” – and that includes funding spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine.
US aid vs. European aid
In both the Tuesday remarks and the Wednesday social media post, Trump returned to his familiar but false claim about a supposedly massive disparity between the amount of Ukraine aid provided by the US and by Europe.
He said Tuesday: “I think Europe has given $100 billion and we’ve given, let’s say, $300-plus (billion).” He wrote Wednesday: “The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe.”
Neither of those statements are accurate.
In fact, according to the Kiel Institute’s data, Europe – the European Union plus individual European countries – had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December (about $258 billion) than the US committed (about $124 billion). Europe had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $138 billion) than the US allocated (about $119 billion).
The US did have a slim lead in one particular category, military aid allocated, providing about $67 billion to about $65 billion for Europe. But even that was nowhere close to the giant gulf Trump described.
Zelensky and ‘missing’ aid money
In the Wednesday social media post, Trump falsely claimed that Zelensky “admits that half of the money we sent him is ‘MISSING.’” He made a similar claim to reporters on Tuesday.
But Zelensky has made no such admission. Rather, he has taken issue with inflated claims about how much US cash Ukraine has received.
He said in a February 1 interview with the Associated Press that although people talk about Ukraine getting as much as $200 billion in US aid, Ukraine had received about $76 billion, largely in the form of weapons. Zelensky said he doesn’t know where all the professed additional money has gone and that perhaps these higher figures are correct “on paper,” according to a translation by the news outlet Ukrainska Pravda.
Contrary to some viral social media posts this month, that wasn’t a confession that half of the cash that the US sent to Ukraine had vanished. In reality, Zelensky was saying exactly what experts in the US and elsewhere have repeatedly pointed out – that a large chunk of the total US budgetary “response” to the Ukraine war is not in the form of money handed to the Ukrainian government.
For example, experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank wrote last May: “The notion of ‘aid to Ukraine’ is a misnomer. Despite images of ‘pallets of cash’ being sent to Ukraine, about 72 percent of this money overall and 86 percent of the military aid will be spent in the United States. The reason for this high percentage is that weapons going to Ukraine are produced in U.S. factories, payments to U.S. service members are mostly spent in the United States, and even some piece of the humanitarian aid is spent in the United States.”
In new comments to reporters on Wednesday, Reuters reported, Zelensky said the US has provided about $67 billion in weapons and $31.5 billion in budget support.

President Donald Trump defended the US taking part in peace talks that excluded Ukraine by rewriting history.
Speaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago after a round of golf on Tuesday, Trump argued that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky “should never have started” the war, adding, “You could have made a deal.”
Say what you want about the many billions in US military aid for Ukraine or which countries the US should be allied with, there’s no realm of reality, except the one pushed by Russia, in which Zelensky started the war that began in February 2022 when Russian forces invaded Ukraine.
Now, after nearly three years of a brutal war of attrition, Zelensky could not get a seat at table for the talks hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and featuring representatives from Putin’s regime, which has been in power for the past 25 years, spanning six different US presidencies.
Zelensky tried to pierce Trump’s alternative facts from a press conference of his own Wednesday morning in Kyiv.
“Unfortunately, President Trump – I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us – unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,” Zelensky said.
Later on his social media platform, Trump aped Kremlin talking points, called Zelensky a “dictator” and baselessly alleged that half of the aid okayed by Congress to help Ukraine has gone missing.
In reality, more than half the US aid to Ukraine has been in the form of weapons systems and ammunition from US stockpiles. The money went from US taxpayers to US-based defense contractors to buy the weapons and equipment for America’s military inventory, and some of that stockpile was then sent to Ukraine.
This may feel like a pivotal moment as Trump leans toward Russia and away from Ukraine.
But it comes in the context of Trump’s remarkable political comeback despite being investigated for his 2016 campaign’s interactions with Russians and impeached for his pressure on Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden before the 2020 election that Trump tried to overturn and still won’t admit he lost.
In other words, there is history. It’s worth looking taking a quick look back at the last decade.
What was happening 10 years ago?
In 2015, as he was running for president, Trump was also pursuing the possibility of a real estate deal in Moscow, although the proposal was scrapped, CNN has reported.
While there was not enough evidence for the subsequent special counsel Robert Mueller to conclude there was collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russians, Russia actively tried to help Trump win, according to US intelligence assessments, which Trump now dismisses as the “Russia Hoax.”
When Trump publicly asked Russians to get Hillary Clinton campaign emails, they immediately started trying, according to indictments filed by the Department of Justice in 2018.
Trump’s campaign chairman for a short time during the 2016 campaign, Paul Manafort, had a history of doing work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, which was among the reasons he ultimately left Trump’s campaign.
What happened during Trump’s first term?
Too much to recount here. Suffice it to say that Russia cast a very long shadow over Trump’s time in office, beginning with the firing of his first national security adviser over lies he told about meeting with the Russian ambassador at the time, the recusal of his first attorney general, the appointment of former FBI director Robert Mueller to investigate Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, the multiple trials of Trump associates, including Manafort, and much more.
Where does Ukraine come in?
As part of an effort to dig up dirt on Biden in 2019, Trump pressured Zelensky, then newly in office, to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid to stand up to Russia. That call led to a whistleblower report and Trump’s first impeachment, although he was acquitted of “high crimes and misdemeanors” in a Senate trial.
Zelensky, at least until Wednesday, has gone out of his way to praise Trump. The two met in New York in September.
But this all brings us to the very odd current dynamic: The foreign leader who Trump may blame for an impeachment is the same one who is getting billions of dollars in US military aid to fight off the foreign leader who US intelligence agencies believe tried to help get Trump elected in 2016. Follow?
What does Trump say about Putin and Ukraine?
Trump likes to brag that Putin took four years off from his designs on Ukraine when Trump was in office. It’s true that Putin’s Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, when President Barack Obama was in office, and tried to finish the job in 2022, when President Joe Biden was in charge.
Trump’s prediction during the 2016 campaign that Putin would not go further into Ukraine if Trump was in office came true.
Other predictions, like his boast during a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris last September that “I will get it settled before I even become president,” have not come true.
What did Trump say when Putin invaded Ukraine?
Trump had called Putin savvy and praised his strength even as Putin was amassing troops on the border of Ukraine. At the time, the Biden administration was trying to convince the world to believe US intelligence that Putin was serious about an invasion and Russia was looking for an excuse to justify one.
Trump called in to Fox News and argued, as he continues to argue today, that it was Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan that made Putin move on his desire to invade Ukraine. Trump does not mention that Biden’s Afghanistan plan was originally hatched during Trump’s own administration.
For a refresher of what was happening almost exactly three years ago when Russia invaded Ukraine, read CNN’s report from that day. In it, Russia’s spokesman argued the invasion was part of an effort to “liberate” Ukraine,” which needed to be “cleansed of Nazis.” Zelensky, for the record, is Jewish.
What are other Republicans saying now?
In the years since the invasion, many Republicans have largely gravitated to Trump’s way of thinking. Some defenders of Ukraine, like then-Sen. Marco Rubio, have evolved. Rubio is now Trump’s Secretary of State and took part in those Saudi Arabia peace talks. Other Republicans, like Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, still hold an anti-Russia viewpoint, but the party is clearly reorienting itself around Trump’s way of thinking.
Will Putin stand down under Trump?
Wendy Sherman was a State Department official in the Biden administration who was involved in talks with Russia before the 2022 invasion. In an interview Wednesday, Sherman told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour it’s clear Putin still has designs on claiming Ukraine as part an effort to reconstitute the Russian empire.
“He believes it ideologically. He believes it historically, and I don’t think he will settle for anything other than a chance to ultimately take all of (Ukraine),” she said, criticizing Trump for heaping concessions on Putin and normalizing relations between the US and Russia in favor of a peace deal.",['Zachary B.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/donald-trump-putin-ukraine-analysis/index.html,Trump’s slam of Zelensky is a remarkable moment in US foreign policy,2024-07-19 00:00:00,"President Donald Trump has now fully adopted Russia’s false propaganda on Ukraine, turning against a sovereign democracy that was invaded in favor of the invader.
Trump’s furious attacks on President Volodymyr Zelensky come after he opened talks on ending the war but excluded the nation whose territory was seized by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
On Tuesday, Trump wrongly accused Ukraine of starting the conflict and parroted another Moscow talking point in saying that the Ukrainian president should hold an election that was suspended because his country is in a state of war, under daily attack from Moscow’s forces.
After Zelensky hit back, accusing him of being in a “disinformation space” Trump escalated the fight on Wednesday.
In a post on his Truth Social network, Trump claimed that Zelensky “refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing former President Joe Biden “like a fiddle.” He went on “A Dictator without Elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only ‘TRUMP,’ and the Trump Administration, can do.”
Trump’s claim that Zelensky is a dictator plays into one of Moscow’s rationales for the war — that the elected Ukrainian leader was illegitimate and Russia’s long-term hope of replacing him with a pro-Moscow head of state.
Trump’s turn against Ukraine is not just a remarkable spectacle as the United States changes sides in the middle of a war. It’s one example of Trump’s stunning transformation of US foreign policy as America becomes a nation that is rejecting the international system of alliances and friendships that it built to defend democracy and as its president seeks accommodation with authoritarians like Putin.
Trump had opened the rift on Tuesday following a high-level US-Russia meeting in Saudi Arabia on ending the war.
Zelensky pushed back Wednesday, accusing Trump of peddling Russian untruths and of rehabilitating Russia.
“Unfortunately, President Trump — I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us — unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,” Zelensky said.
“I would like Trump’s team to be more truthful, all of this doesn’t affect Ukraine in a positive way. They are letting Putin out of isolation, and I think Putin and Russian are really happy because they are involved in discussions, and yesterday there were signals that they are the victims. That is something new.”
The US president’s embrace of America’s enemy Russia is worrying some Republican senators although there’s been no real institutional pushback against a position on Ukraine that is popular with Trump’s MAGA base.
One of Trump’s top supporters, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, contradicted his frequent golf partner on Wednesday, although he walked a fine political line.
”When it comes to blame for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I blame Putin above all others,” Graham wrote on X. But he also said that Biden and former President Barack Obama were “pathetically weak in handling Putin.” The South Carolina Republican added that Trump was the best hope to “end this war honorably and justly. I believe he will be successful, and he will achieve this goal in the Trump way.”
Trump contradicts his secretary of state
The US president’s comments will fuel fresh fears among European allies, which was also excluded from the US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, that Trump will try to impose a peace deal in Ukraine that favors his friend in the Kremlin.
His remarks also appeared to directly contradict assurances by his own Secretary of State Marco Rubio after meeting the Russian delegation that any eventual peace agreement would be fair to all parties.
French President Emmanuel Macron was on Wednesday hosting another meeting of European and other international nations over how to handle Trump, his opening to Putin and his attacks on Ukraine.
This came a day after Trump launched his attempt to delegitimize Zelensky, who was on the phone call that led to the US president’s first impeachment in his first term.
“We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump also claimed that Zelensky’s approval rating was “at 4%” and “we have a country that has been blown to smithereens.”
Reliable polling has been difficult in the middle of a war zone that has seen thousands of Ukrainians become internally displaced or flee the country. While recent surveys have shown Zelensky’s popularity dropping significantly from the almost universal approval he enjoyed at the start of the war, it’s nowhere near the depths cited by Trump. Some recent polls have him above 50% approval — which is comparable or better than the US president’s popularity.
The president also warned that for Ukraine’s views on its fate to be considered, it should have an election, saying: “You know, they want a seat at the table, wouldn’t the people of Ukraine have to have a say, like it’s been a lot of times since we’ve had an election?”
Apparently sensitive to criticism that he parrots Russian propaganda in his statements on the war, Trump insisted, “That’s not a Russia thing; that’s something that’s coming from me.”
Ukraine’s last election was due to have taken place last April, but Zelensky said it wasn’t possible for voters to go to the polls in wartime — a position that is backed up by the country’s Constitution. Trump’s insistence on voters having their say in a democracy is ironic given his own refusal to listen to the verdict of Americans in the 2020 presidential election that he lost. And it’s even more brazen since Putin has stayed in power for over two decades by holding sham elections and imposing severe domestic repression.
Trump tries to fog the cause of Ukraine war
Trump’s latest attempt to curate American sentiment around Ukraine is similar to many of his previous efforts to fog the truth in an effort to create room for his political aspirations. The most prominent example of him doing was the 2020 election.
At Mar-a-Lago, he also tried to reinvent the facts around Russia’s invasion three years ago, when Putin’s forces rolled across the border of an independent, sovereign democracy and redrew the map of Europe.
“Today I heard, ‘Oh well, we weren’t invited,’” the president said, referring to Ukraine’s complaints that it’s not been allowed to take part in the nascent peace process. “Well, you been there for three years. You should’ve ended it after three years. You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal,” he said.
In essence, the president seems to be suggesting that the Ukrainians should have made an agreement with Russia to avoid the invasion — which, in practice, would have involved submitting to a puppet government in Kyiv loyal to Moscow or simply giving up fighting to hand a win to Putin.
Trump’s response to the Saudi talks, which he said on Tuesday could be followed by an in-person meeting with Putin by the end of the month, risked redoubling what was already a victory for the Russian side. His comments are also likely to further cement opposition to his long-shot peace plans among Europeans, who his administration says must be responsible for enforcing any future agreement to stop the fighting.
Trump seemed vague about what a peace deal in Ukraine would look like, underscoring impressions that his top goal is a deal of any kind, which would allow him to claim a personal political victory but that his critics fear could foster future conflict.
He said Tuesday he’d be open to the possibility of European troops enforcing any eventual agreement – even though the idea was rejected by Moscow’s envoys at the Saudi Arabia talks. He didn’t comment on British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s warning that such a force would only be viable with a US “backstop.” This followed US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s warning last week that no American troops would be involved in keeping the peace in Ukraine. Starmer is due in Washington next week to meet the president and is presenting himself as a bridge between the US and Europe.
But Trump’s enthusiasm for Putin is not shared by at least two senior Republican senators.
Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said Tuesday that he does not think the Russian leader can be trusted. The Mississippi senator told CNN’s Manu Raju that “Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed.”
And Sen. John Kennedy agreed with his colleague’s acidic assessment of the Russian leader though stopped short of criticizing Trump’s approach to the peace talks. “Vladimir Putin has a black heart. He clearly has Stalin’s taste for blood,” the Louisiana senator said. Underscoring the party’s deference to Trump, however, he also rejected claims that the president had offered significant concessions to Russia simply by bringing it in from diplomatic isolation.
“I haven’t seen us take any steps to take the pressure off Putin,” he said.

In remarks to reporters on Tuesday and in a social media post on Wednesday, Trump made numerous false claims about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Russian war on Ukraine – some of which echoed inaccurate talking points from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Here is a fact check of some of his assertions.
Who started the war
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump dismissed Ukraine’s complaints about its exclusion from US-Russia talks on ending the war – and falsely said of Ukraine: “You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal.”
Ukraine did not start the war. Russia started the war by invading Ukraine in 2022. Trump’s own former vice president, Mike Pence, and several Republican lawmakers have noted this obvious fact in the wake of Trump’s lie.
Zelensky’s approval rating
In the same Tuesday remarks, Trump called for a new Ukrainian election – last year’s previously scheduled presidential election was called off because the country is under martial law – and falsely claimed Zelensky is “down at 4% percent approval rating.”
That 4% figure is not even close to accurate.
The latest survey from a leading Ukrainian pollster, conducted earlier this month, found that 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted Zelensky. That was up from 52% in December – and 52% was Zelensky’s lowest wartime figure in this series of trust surveys. In addition, an approval survey conducted from late November to early January found 63% of Ukrainians either approved fully or tended to approve of Zelensky’s actions as president.
US wartime aid to Ukraine
In the Wednesday social media post, Trump falsely claimed that Zelensky “talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars” to “go into” an unwinnable war.
The $350 billion figure, too, is far from reality.
According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine, the US had committed a total of about $124 billion in military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between late January 2022, just before the Russian invasion, and the end of December 2024; the think tank found the US had actually allocated about $119 billion.

On Tuesday, Trump wrongly accused Ukraine of starting the conflict and parroted another Moscow talking point in saying that the Ukrainian president should hold an election that was suspended because his country is in a state of war, under daily attack from Moscow’s forces.
After Zelensky hit back, accusing him of being in a “disinformation space” Trump escalated the fight on Wednesday.
In a post on his Truth Social network, Trump claimed that Zelensky “refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing former President Joe Biden “like a fiddle.” He went on “A Dictator without Elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only ‘TRUMP,’ and the Trump Administration, can do.”
Trump’s claim that Zelensky is a dictator plays into one of Moscow’s rationales for the war — that the elected Ukrainian leader was illegitimate and Russia’s long-term hope of replacing him with a pro-Moscow head of state.
Trump’s turn against Ukraine is not just a remarkable spectacle as the United States changes sides in the middle of a war. It’s one example of Trump’s stunning transformation of US foreign policy as America becomes a nation that is rejecting the international system of alliances and friendships that it built to defend democracy and as its president seeks accommodation with authoritarians like Putin.
Trump had opened the rift on Tuesday following a high-level US-Russia meeting in Saudi Arabia on ending the war.
Zelensky pushed back Wednesday, accusing Trump of peddling Russian untruths and of rehabilitating Russia.
“Unfortunately, President Trump — I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us — unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,” Zelensky said.
“I would like Trump’s team to be more truthful, all of this doesn’t affect Ukraine in a positive way. They are letting Putin out of isolation, and I think Putin and Russian are really happy because they are involved in discussions, and yesterday there were signals that they are the victims. That is something new.”
The US president’s embrace of America’s enemy Russia is worrying some Republican senators although there’s been no real institutional pushback against a position on Ukraine that is popular with Trump’s MAGA base.
One of Trump’s top supporters, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, contradicted his frequent golf partner on Wednesday, although he walked a fine political line.
”When it comes to blame for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I blame Putin above all others,” Graham wrote on X. But he also said that Biden and former President Barack Obama were “pathetically weak in handling Putin.” The South Carolina Republican added that Trump was the best hope to “end this war honorably and justly. I believe he will be successful, and he will achieve this goal in the Trump way.”
Trump contradicts his secretary of state
The US president’s comments will fuel fresh fears among European allies, which was also excluded from the US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, that Trump will try to impose a peace deal in Ukraine that favors his friend in the Kremlin.
His remarks also appeared to directly contradict assurances by his own Secretary of State Marco Rubio after meeting the Russian delegation that any eventual peace agreement would be fair to all parties.
French President Emmanuel Macron was on Wednesday hosting another meeting of European and other international nations over how to handle Trump, his opening to Putin and his attacks on Ukraine.
This came a day after Trump launched his attempt to delegitimize Zelensky, who was on the phone call that led to the US president’s first impeachment in his first term.
“We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump also claimed that Zelensky’s approval rating was “at 4%” and “we have a country that has been blown to smithereens.”
Reliable polling has been difficult in the middle of a war zone that has seen thousands of Ukrainians become internally displaced or flee the country. While recent surveys have shown Zelensky’s popularity dropping significantly from the almost universal approval he enjoyed at the start of the war, it’s nowhere near the depths cited by Trump. Some recent polls have him above 50% approval — which is comparable or better than the US president’s popularity.
The president also warned that for Ukraine’s views on its fate to be considered, it should have an election, saying: “You know, they want a seat at the table, wouldn’t the people of Ukraine have to have a say, like it’s been a lot of times since we’ve had an election?”
Apparently sensitive to criticism that he parrots Russian propaganda in his statements on the war, Trump insisted, “That’s not a Russia thing; that’s something that’s coming from me.”
Ukraine’s last election was due to have taken place last April, but Zelensky said it wasn’t possible for voters to go to the polls in wartime — a position that is backed up by the country’s Constitution. Trump’s insistence on voters having their say in a democracy is ironic given his own refusal to listen to the verdict of Americans in the 2020 presidential election that he lost. And it’s even more brazen since Putin has stayed in power for over two decades by holding sham elections and imposing severe domestic repression.
Trump tries to fog the cause of Ukraine war
Trump’s latest attempt to curate American sentiment around Ukraine is similar to many of his previous efforts to fog the truth in an effort to create room for his political aspirations. The most prominent example of him doing was the 2020 election.
At Mar-a-Lago, he also tried to reinvent the facts around Russia’s invasion three years ago, when Putin’s forces rolled across the border of an independent, sovereign democracy and redrew the map of Europe.
“Today I heard, ‘Oh well, we weren’t invited,’” the president said, referring to Ukraine’s complaints that it’s not been allowed to take part in the nascent peace process. “Well, you been there for three years. You should’ve ended it after three years. You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal,” he said.
In essence, the president seems to be suggesting that the Ukrainians should have made an agreement with Russia to avoid the invasion — which, in practice, would have involved submitting to a puppet government in Kyiv loyal to Moscow or simply giving up fighting to hand a win to Putin.
Trump’s response to the Saudi talks, which he said on Tuesday could be followed by an in-person meeting with Putin by the end of the month, risked redoubling what was already a victory for the Russian side. His comments are also likely to further cement opposition to his long-shot peace plans among Europeans, who his administration says must be responsible for enforcing any future agreement to stop the fighting.
Trump seemed vague about what a peace deal in Ukraine would look like, underscoring impressions that his top goal is a deal of any kind, which would allow him to claim a personal political victory but that his critics fear could foster future conflict.
He said Tuesday he’d be open to the possibility of European troops enforcing any eventual agreement – even though the idea was rejected by Moscow’s envoys at the Saudi Arabia talks. He didn’t comment on British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s warning that such a force would only be viable with a US “backstop.” This followed US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s warning last week that no American troops would be involved in keeping the peace in Ukraine. Starmer is due in Washington next week to meet the president and is presenting himself as a bridge between the US and Europe.
But Trump’s enthusiasm for Putin is not shared by at least two senior Republican senators.
Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker said Tuesday that he does not think the Russian leader can be trusted. The Mississippi senator told CNN’s Manu Raju that “Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed.”
And Sen. John Kennedy agreed with his colleague’s acidic assessment of the Russian leader though stopped short of criticizing Trump’s approach to the peace talks. “Vladimir Putin has a black heart. He clearly has Stalin’s taste for blood,” the Louisiana senator said. Underscoring the party’s deference to Trump, however, he also rejected claims that the president had offered significant concessions to Russia simply by bringing it in from diplomatic isolation.
“I haven’t seen us take any steps to take the pressure off Putin,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trump-falsely-claims-zelensky-has-a-4-approval-rating-its-above-50/index.html,Fact check: Trump falsely claims Zelensky has a 4% approval rating. It’s above 50%,2025-02-19 16:24:03,"President Donald Trump’s false declaration Tuesday that Ukraine “started” the Russian war on Ukraine generated the most attention. But Trump also made another wildly inaccurate assertion about Ukraine during those remarks to the media at Mar-a-Lago: a claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has a 4% approval rating.
Trump was pushing Ukraine to hold its first presidential election since Zelensky was elected in 2019. The Ukrainian constitution does not allow national elections under martial law; Ukraine, which has been under martial law since the Russian invasion in 2022, called off the presidential election that would otherwise have been held in 2024.
When Trump was asked Tuesday if the US would ever support a reported Russian demand “to force Ukraine to hold new elections in order to sign any kind of a peace deal,” Trump responded, “Well, we have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine; where we have martial law, essentially martial law, in Ukraine; where the leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, but he’s down at 4% percent approval rating.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is not even close to accurate. Zelensky’s approval rating is far higher than 4%. In fact, it has been above 50% in major recent surveys.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Zelensky described Trump’s “4%” claim as disinformation from Russia. Wherever Trump got the number – the White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment – it is detached from reality.
Keith Darden, an American University professor who studies Ukraine, told CNN on Wednesday that a poll this month from “the best and most reliable survey organization in Ukraine,” the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, found that 57% of Ukrainians trusted Zelensky. (Darden said, “They do not ask ‘approval’ ratings, but about ‘trust’ in leadership. In Ukrainian, it’s very similar to approval,” referring to a “kind of trust that they are doing a good job in their role.”)
The new poll was published after Trump made his “4%” claim – but the organization’s previous poll, from December, found that 52% of Ukrainians had trust in Zelensky. And that was Zelensky’s lowest trust figure in the organization’s polling since the Russian invasion in February 2022.
Olga Onuch, a University of Manchester professor who conducts public opinion research in Ukraine with other academics, told CNN on Tuesday that their latest survey, conducted from November 22 of last year to January 7 of this year, found that “63% of Ukrainians either approve fully or tend to approve of Zelensky’s actions as president.” She said their survey was also performed by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.
Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics and Ukraine’s economic minister in 2019 and 2020, told CNN on Tuesday, “We have never seen anything close” to a 4% approval rating for Zelensky. Mylovanov said Zelensky’s lowest approval ratings were in 2021, but even then were much higher than 4%. He pointed to one late-2021 survey that found approval of Zelensky at about 26%.",['Daniel Dale'],en

A new report reveals there were about 300 food recalls in the US last year, associated with nearly 1,400 illnesses.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Ukraine war talks
The US and Russia will appoint high-level teams to negotiate the end of the war in Ukraine and are working to reestablish diplomatic channels, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday at the end of talks that excluded Kyiv. The meeting marked the first time top US and Russian officials had met face-to-face since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said he would not accept any deal made in Ukraine’s absence. Trump also announced he will “probably” meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the end of the month.
2. Delta plane crash
Investigators are working to determine what caused a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to crash and roll over on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday. Dramatic new video shows the jet’s rear landing gear buckling and the right wing shearing away in a fireball after making a hard landing. Aviation experts tell CNN that advancements in aircraft design and seat safety prevented the crash from being much worse. While the incident has renewed some fears about flying, analysts say it’s important to remember that commercial air travel in the US has been safer than ever before. There have been fewer fatalities on scheduled commercial airliners over the last 15 years than in any other 15-year stretch.
3. Immigration
The Trump administration is cutting off legal services for unaccompanied migrant children — the latest in a series of actions stripping key resources from immigrants in the US. The Department of the Interior sent the order to a nonprofit group that has been helping thousands of children who cross the southern border without their parents. Also this week, President Trump’s border czar Tom Homan touted what he said is a record low number of border encounters: “229 total encounters at the Southwest border — 229 — compare that to 11,000 per day under [President] Biden,” Homan said in a Fox News interview. “229 encounters in a 24-hour period, that is a record,” he added.
4. Tariffs
President Trump said that he plans to impose tariffs of around 25% on auto imports as well as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals shipped to the US as early as April. The steep new tariffs could have far-reaching effects, extending beyond the specific industries where taxes are levied. Consumers are expected to feel most of the burden of the new import taxes on automobiles as prices of cars could jump by thousands of dollars. As for the pharmaceutical industry, the US purchased more than $176 billion of drugs and related goods in 2023, according to US trade data, making it the largest importer of pharmaceutical products that year. Experts say European, Indian and Chinese firms could be the hardest hit.
5. Measles outbreak
At least 58 measles cases were reported in an outbreak in West Texas, including some people who said they were vaccinated. The cases are mostly in children ages 5 to 17, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Given how contagious measles is, health officials warn that cases may continue to rise in the area. Measles is an airborne illness that can cause rash, fever, red eyes and cough. Severe cases can result in blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis — which is swelling of the brain. In some cases, the illness can be fatal. There were 285 measles cases reported in the US last year, the most since 2019, CDC data shows.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/europe/ukraine-counts-costs-of-usaid-suspension-intl/index.html,Ukraine counts the costs of USAID suspension,2025-02-17 14:54:03,"Some 400 calls for help went unanswered when the helpline at Ukraine’s Veteran Hub went silent for a week after key funding from the United States was abruptly cut last month.
The Ukrainian NGO gets all sorts of calls. Some come from military families who have just found out their loved one was killed on the frontline. Some are from injured veterans who are struggling to cope with their return to civilian life or need help navigating the bureaucracy.
And some calls can save lives.
“Just a few days before the freeze, we had a request from a person who declared a suicide attempt and was seeking support, and we were able to provide that support,” Veteran Hub’s co-founder Ivona Kostyna told CNN in an interview. “We don’t know how many of those (unanswered) calls were of that nature,” she added.
Kostyna and her colleagues had no choice but to shut the helpline down last month after receiving a stop-work order from the United States Department of State – a direct consequence of President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend nearly all US foreign aid.
The freeze is already causing hardship across Ukraine, with lifesaving projects suddenly put on hold.
Ukraine has been by far the biggest recipient of USAID funds in the past three years, ever since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.
According to the agency’s now defunct website, USAID has provided Ukraine with a total of $37.6 billion in humanitarian aid, development assistance and direct budget support since the full-scale war began.
Trump and his allies have said the agency, created by the US legislature as an independent body, is overtly partisan. Opposition lawmakers and former USAID administrators from both political parties have rejected that assertion and called for America’s foreign assistance programs to be protected.
After the European Union, the US is Ukraine’s biggest donor of humanitarian aid, providing more than a quarter of all the country receives. It is by far the biggest donor of military aid.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his government was trying to find alternative sources of funding from within Ukraine and abroad. “These are areas that the government cannot provide for because the government doesn’t have enough money because the government is funding the army,” Kostyna said.
But the impact of the suspension goes way beyond the funding.
Kostyna said that many of the hub’s employees are either the main or sole breadwinners in their families, which means they cannot afford to be on unpaid leave. Most are highly qualified, with years of experience.
“So not only would we lose that person but, if the funding comes back, we’d have to rebuild, and we would lose six months training the next person. This is why continuity is so important,” she said.
‘Zero warning’
It’s a similar story at the Vykhid charitable foundation, which focuses on HIV and tuberculosis prevention among vulnerable people. “I’m losing qualified people, with a lot of experience,” its director, Olena Goriacheva, told CNN. She said that the freeze meant she had to let go of an experienced project coordinator for two programs funded by USAID.
Vykhid has been a USAID partner since 2004. It serves roughly 5,000 clients at any given time, including drug users, newly diagnosed people and long-term patients.
The foundation relies on USAID for more than half of its funding, although there were times in the past when it was its only source. “We realized (then) that it is impossible to have only one donor for the organization to exist and we tried to have diversified sources of funding – thank God that we still have that,” Goriacheva said.
The foundation has had to shut down a key project focused on detection of new HIV cases since the freeze was announced, Goriacheva said. Ukraine has the highest prevalence of HIV in Europe and one of the highest outside Africa. The country experienced a rapidly spreading epidemic in the 1990s and, while rates have since dropped, early detection remains crucial.
“There are very few (people) doing this type of work. Doctors who worked with us for six years were receiving remuneration from us for any new patient they identified,” she said. “Now that the project has closed, some of them have stopped doing this activity completely.”
The foundation also provides other assistance to people living with HIV. It received a request last week to cover the cost of an MRI scan for a severely ill HIV patient in an intensive care unit.
The hospital turned to Vykhid, but because of the stop-work order Goriacheva had to turn the request down. Thankfully, she said, the hospital was able to find funding elsewhere.
The sudden nature of the funding freeze has made the situation particularly difficult. The order came without warning, effectively pulling the plug on hundreds of projects across Ukraine.
Kostyna said that anyone working in the non-profit sector knows that funding sources can dry up. “But it never crossed our mind that it could stop in a day. And it’s not about the money, it’s about the fact that we had zero warning, and we had no way to cover (the cuts) because we are not allowed to put money aside,” she said.
Goriacheva said that earlier this week, she was told by USAID subcontractors that some of the projects – those deemed essential – were being restored.
“Not in full. But those services that are vital are being restored,” she said, adding that she is now reaching out to her former project coordinators to figure out how to proceed.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed last week that the US has continued to provide lifesaving humanitarian aid despite the freeze, but multiple USAID staff and contractors who have spoken to CNN say that’s not reflective of the situation on the ground.
‘On the verge of a disaster’
The rural community of Shevchenkove in the Mykolaiv region of southern Ukraine has been hit hard by the war. It was partially occupied for nine months after the full-scale invasion. The head of the local administration, Oleh Pylypenko, was detained by Russian forces.
Ukrainian forces liberated the area in November 2022, but the damage suffered during the occupation was extensive.
“Everything that was destroyed had to be rebuilt, and everything that was occupied had to be rebuilt,” said Pylypenko, who was released in a prisoner swap.
Health was a major issue for the community following the lengthy occupation, he said. Doctors and healthcare professionals funded by foreign aid money, including USAID, set up diagnostic clinics and have been distributing free medicines. All of the services that relied solely on USAID funding have now been suspended.
Pylypenko said he doubts that other international donors can match the funds previously provided by USAID. “I think (the situation) is on the verge of a disaster,” he said, adding that even if the programs are restarted after the initial 90-day freeze announced by Trump, it will take much longer to get them back up and running.
This delay will have a significant impact on the community, he said. One local project funded by USAID was focused on setting up emergency educational spaces. These are fully equipped classrooms in safe locations with access to shelters, where children whose schools were destroyed can attend in-person classes.
One was opened recently in the region, and another was supposed to open in March. Pylypenko said the children who were due to attend had seen their original schools destroyed during the occupation, only for another at which they were attending classes to be hit by a Russian drone last summer.
Pylypenko now hopes they can have the new space ready for September, but if Trump’s freeze is renewed, alternative funding will need to be found, “God willing.”
But what worries Pylypenko the most is the freeze impacting Ukraine’s access to the training programs provided by USAID. These tend to focus on local government, anti-corruption, efficiency and democracy-building, and they are key for Ukraine’s future development, as well as its hopes of eventually joining the European Union.
“These were good training programs, plus there was exchange of experiences with the best communities, and the level (of performance) rose significantly,” he said, likening the USAID programs to the proverb about teaching people to fish, rather than just sending them fish to eat.
Working for free
Kostyna first launched the Veteran Hub in 2016, after a firsthand experience with trauma. Her friend, 19-year-old Ustym Holodnyuk, was killed by a sniper at Kyiv’s Maidan, or Independence Square, during the 2014 protests. She struggled for a long time without support.
“It didn’t even (cross) my mind to reach out for help, to reach out to a psychologist. And now, fast forward 10 years, and the impact that we, among others, have managed to achieve is that there is a large change in how people perceive this, we see a rising number of veterans (who say) they trust psychologists,” she said.
Kostyna said that the consistency in the US foreign aid program meant that she and her colleagues were able to build something that was unheard of in Ukraine just a decade ago: a comprehensive veterans’ affairs (support?) service.
“We now have taxi drivers bringing people in when they’re in distress. So they would sit in a taxi, share their story, and the taxi driver would (make a detour) and bring them to us… they do this regularly,” she said.
Most of those working at the Veteran Hub are relatives of veterans, active service members, or people who have experienced trauma, she said. Like many in Ukraine, they are struggling to make ends meet, living paycheck to paycheck.
Yet when the stop-work order came in, staff at one of their two centers refused to leave.
“In the week of the freeze, when we didn’t have funding, our Vinnytsia hub remained open, even though we couldn’t pay our employees. They didn’t receive (a) salary, but they all showed up to work on Monday, wearing uniforms, and they continued working,” she said.
There was some good news that week. After three days of intense fundraising efforts, the Veteran Hub managed to secure enough money to keep the helpline open for three months and get 14 people back to work. A few days later it received assurances from local businesses and the Vinnytsia city council that they will provide funding until the Veteran Hub finds a long-term solution.
The fact that she didn’t have to shutter the hub was a lifesaver, Kostyna said.
“There are so many people who just turn up,” she said. “There was a veteran who lost his documents, and he was referred to us because he was literally homeless, and he was looking for shelter and he needed medicine, and we were able to assist him.”
If the hub’s doors were to close, people like him would find themselves with nowhere else to go.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Maria Kostenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/politics/trump-putin-concessions-ukraine-analysis/index.html,Trump offers key concessions to Putin ahead of Ukraine peace talks in Saudi Arabia,2025-02-17 05:00:46,"Vladimir Putin is riding high ahead of critical US-Russia talks Tuesday in Saudi Arabia on ending the Ukraine war.
Donald Trump’s administration has ended the Russian president’s international isolation, shattered Western unity on the conflict and cast doubt on how far the US would go to defend Europe, signaling a stunning shift toward Putin and away from America’s traditional allies.
With a flurry of conflicting statements in their first forays into Europe, Trump aides also fueled concerns that the US president will embrace just about any deal with Putin — even if it’s a bad one for Ukraine and a continent whose borders are again threatened by Russian expansionism.
Suggestions that the US will exclude its European friends from peace talks on Ukraine — despite demanding they provide security guarantees and troops as part of any deal to end the war — also triggered alarm in capitals on the continent, with France calling key leaders to an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday.
Trump has also sparked fears that Ukraine itself would not be part of talks that are critical to its survival as a nation after its sovereign territory was invaded by a totalitarian neighbor bringing war crimes, civilian carnage and destruction on its people.
The president on Sunday raised the prospect of a meeting with Putin “very soon.” He told reporters in Florida: “We’re moving along. We’re trying to get a peace with Russia, Ukraine, and we’re working very hard on it.”
After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he would “never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine,” Trump gave a vague assurance that he would be “involved.”
Rubio says the Saudi talks are a first step
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will head the US delegation for talks hosted by the Saudis, who are friendly with both Moscow and the Trump team.
Rubio styled the meeting as a follow-up to Trump’s phone call last week with Putin. “The next few weeks and days will determine whether it’s serious or not,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one.”
Rubio also contradicted comments by Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, who said Saturday that while Kyiv would be involved in peace talks, European nations wouldn’t. “If it’s real negotiations — and we’re not there yet — but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they’re the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and they’ve contributed to this effort,” Rubio said.
The evolving US line on the proposed peace deal shows that it’s often unwise to overreact to the early rhetoric of Trump and his subordinates before the substance of their positions is locked in. Without the new US president’s determination to forge ties with Putin, there’d be little hope of ending a vicious war in the coming months. And there still appears to be substantial room for Ukraine and European states to shape negotiations that can be fully successful only with their buy-in.
Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said in Munich over the weekend that he thought Trump’s call with Putin was a mistake since it “vindicated” the Russian leader and lowered morale in Ukraine. But he added: “When President Trump says as part of a deal there will have to be European troops, we will have to be asked to supply them, so sooner or later we will have to be involved.”
Still, mixed messages from the administration will fuel concerns that Trump will agree to a deal with Putin that validates the illegal invasion and will then impose it on Ukraine. While most foreign policy realists accept that Ukraine will not get back all the land seized by Russia, Trump was criticized for throwing away leverage with his call with the Russian leader. As was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who said that a peace deal would not include a path to NATO membership for Ukraine and that no US peacekeeping troops would be involved. Some of those statements were later watered down by Hegseth and other administration officials.
Concerns were exacerbated by Trump’s warp-speed attempt last week to fully rehabilitate Putin, an accused war criminal, when he promoted Russia’s foreign policy positions rather than the West’s. The president, for instance, seemed to sympathize with Putin’s rationales for the invasion and called for his return to the G8 grouping of industrialized nations after Russia was kicked out over the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Trump’s rejection of the previous administration’s lockstep coordination with Europe over Ukraine and the absence of Kyiv’s negotiators from the Saudi talks also appeared to seriously weaken the Western negotiating position. European officials are likely to be far more sympathetic to Ukraine’s views than Trump — and so if they are absent from any full-scale negotiations, Zelensky’s position could be severely diminished.
A searing attack on European democracy by Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security conference — and his decision to meet the leader of the far-right anti-immigrant AfD party just days before the German election — meanwhile shook European leaders. The speech was a clear sign the Trump administration intends to promote many of the populist movements that are evoking dark echoes on a continent twice destroyed by war in the 20th century. And Hegseth’s blunt warning in Brussels last week that Europeans needed to “take ownership of conventional security on the continent” was widely seen as a sign of Trump’s antipathy for NATO and its security umbrella.
All of this is music to Putin’s ears, since it suggests that his status as an international pariah is over, and that he has a deal within reach over Ukraine that would cement his territorial gains. The divisions Trump has opened inside NATO is delivering on one of Russia’s most important foreign policy goals.
“It’s indeed like Easter, Hanukkah, Christmas, (the) birthday of Vladimir Putin and everything is happening in one day,” Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on Sunday. “Whatever Champagne is not chilled is brought to the fridge and other bottles are uncorked.”
France calls emergency meeting
The crisis in transatlantic relations prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to call an informal meeting Monday with the leaders of Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as the heads of the European Council, the European Commission and NATO’s secretary general.
While Trump’s hostility to 80 years of post-World War II security policy is a stunning shift in US policy and a sign of his antipathy to internationalist goals, Europe has left itself vulnerable to more isolationist currents in US policy that have long been part of America’s DNA.
Years of strangled defense budgets have left most non-US NATO members poorly prepared for the task of defending Europe and the dominant role the Trump administration is now demanding. Swift increases in defense spending will mean painful choices for leaders who are already struggling to finance welfare states and are hampered by low-growth economies.
But there are already some indications that the Trump administration’s hardline position is concentrating minds as leaders seek to impress the president. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who plans to meet with Trump in the coming days, said he’s willing to send British troops to Ukraine as part of any peace deal. Writing in Monday’s Daily Telegraph, Starmer also said European nations “must increase our defense spending and take on a greater role in NATO” — but added that US support would remain critical for guaranteeing peace.
The talks in Saudi Arabia will also highlight another evolving theme in international relations — the growing clout of the kingdom — evidenced by both its growing role under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Middle East affairs but also by its soft-power initiatives like investments in European sports leagues and its hosting of the 2034 FIFA World Cup.
Trump has made no secret of his admiration for strongmen leaders, and the prince and Putin have a tight relationship. A source close to the Saudi court told CNN’s Alex Marquardt that hosting the talks would enhance the Saudis’ image and prestige and show them to be players on one of the top issues of the day.
Saudi Arabia will be vital to another of Trump’s foreign policy goals — ending the war in Gaza. The administration is trying to coax the Saudis and the Israelis toward a diplomatic normalization agreement that could reshape the geopolitics of the Middle East and solidify an Arab front against Iran. But such a deal would be politically impossible for the Saudis without a path to a state for the Palestinians. And Arab states have pushed back hard against Trump’s extraordinary plan to relocate Palestinians en masse out of Gaza in what would amount to a form of ethnic cleansing.
Trump’s fantastical plan for the US to “own” and redevelop Gaza, as well as his apparent desire to enter talks with Putin on Ukraine, underscore the risks of his unorthodox approach to foreign relations. But the president is b ack in the White House at a unique moment that offers opportunities to pursue agreements that could make America and the world safer — that is, unless he inks deals that ignore grave security implications.
Sikorski warned in Munich that the president was playing for huge stakes.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz are all traveling to Saudi Arabia for the talks.
A Saudi official told CNN they would be doing more than just hosting and would be involved in a mediation role. The Saudi team will be led by the country’s national security adviser.
A Ukrainian official said they would not be present at the talks though Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine envoy, discussed a “dual track” set of negotiations and will be in Kyiv this week. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the Ukrainians would be part of the negotiations.
News of the US-Russia talks came as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday he was “ready and willing” to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine to enforce a peace deal if necessary.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Starmer said he does not take the possibility lightly but reasoned that helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security would also strengthen the security of the United Kingdom and Europe.
He called on European nations to increase their defense spending and “take on a greater role in NATO,” but said US support would remain critical for guaranteeing peace. The prime minister also said he would meet with Trump and other G7 allies in the coming days to secure a strong deal.
Starmer is among the European leaders who will take part in an emergency summit on Ukraine on Monday amid growing concern that the Trump administration’s push to work with Russia to end the war has left them isolated.
The Elysée Palace said French President Emmanuel Macron would hold an “informal” meeting Monday with “the heads of government of Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission and the Secretary General of NATO.”
Starmer on Saturday called the European meeting a “once in a generation” moment for national security and said the UK would “work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together,” according to a Downing Street statement. “We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face,” he said.
Trump has talked openly about the Saudis playing a key role in the negotiations and the country has been an important part of US foreign policy under his presidency.
It was just a week ago that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman helped facilitate the release of Marc Fogel in Russia.

The question for European leaders now is: what can any of them do about it?
A hastily organized meeting in Paris, for now short on details in terms of attendance, is a measure of their concern as they wake up to the reality of Trump 2.0: that their long-standing American ally is no longer much of an ally and may in fact be far more dangerous to them existentially than they had imagined possible only a week ago.
There was, of course, US Vice President JD Vance’s startling speech in Munich on Friday, a rallying cry to the European far right that was quickly seized upon by their news outlets, in which he accused a stone-faced crowd of democratically elected European leaders on their own continent of selling out.
In a remarkable and disingenuous twisting of recent European history, Vance accused his audience of having betrayed the very ideals that allies had fought for during World War II. The danger, he said, warming to a theme he had touched upon in Paris just a few days before at French President Emmanuel Macron’s AI summit, was in Europe’s stifling of free speech, warning his audience that they should fear neither Moscow nor Beijing but European leadership itself.
It was a speech that went so much further than anyone had anticipated by questioning the moral underpinnings of the NATO alliance itself, rather than simply the operational question of budgetary contributions that had so far been President Donald Trump’s principal gripe.
Yet the vice president’s words, as surprising as they were, were not the only ones to set European alarm bells ringing.
Another senior American official to speak in Munich was the special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, who sought to reassure the conference with tough words about his plan for extracting concessions from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The American position, he said, was to be tough on Moscow, to demand territory from Russia and security guarantees for Europe. Yet his comments came only days after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told his NATO counterparts in Brussels that he couldn’t see Ukraine joining the alliance at all, sweeping aside in one fell swoop not just the American position thus far but also what many had considered a key piece of leverage as negotiations with Moscow began.
The fear for Europeans is not now simply that Americans are preparing to negotiate without them but that they are preparing to negotiate badly without them. And while an invitation to Ukrainian leaders to join the discussions in Saudi Arabia may be in the post, for now the prospect is of American and Russian negotiators gathering around a table to discuss not just the future of the 6 million Ukrainians currently living under Russian occupation but also that of a European security architecture that impacts most closely the people living in Kyiv and Paris and every city in between.
The fact is that European countries, like their American ally thus far, spent nearly three years depleting their own arsenals and treasuries in the name of a fight for freedom and democracy that had felt to them existential as the Russian invasion began. That now appears to have been entirely brushed aside in the name of political expediency and the search for peace.
And, while peace is also what Europeans aspire to, their worry is now how costly it may be, given the price Washington seems prepared to pay, and how short lived, given Putin’s record.
Hence the meeting in Paris. European leaders may not be able to weigh in on the terms of a future peace deal but they do hope to find ways of giving security guarantees to Kyiv. Yet the danger facing them as they head to the French capital is that that just as the fight for Ukraine united them three years ago, so too might the specter of peace on their Eastern flank divide them once more. Particularly at a time when several of them are facing an increasingly emboldened and electorally successful European far right that is far more closely aligned with Washington’s new leaders than they are.
But European leaders are also keen not to appear rattled. The French foreign minister explained on French radio on Sunday that these sorts of meetings happened all the time. And Macron himself billed Monday’s talks as “an informal meeting” for those interested “in peace and security in Europe.”
For now, we expect not only the presidents of the EU council and Commission to attend, but also the NATO secretary general and the leaders of Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland and Denmark. The British prime minister has also confirmed his presence, with Downing Street calling it a “once in a generation moment” for national security.
Few of those heading to Paris had doubted that Trump meant what he said the first time round, it’s more that now he appears to have surrounded himself with people who know exactly what they’re doing when it comes to undermining Europe and dismantling NATO. And they are, it seems, done with doing Europe’s bidding. This will make Monday’s meeting not just about how to help Ukraine, but, at its heart, about how to save Europe itself.",['Melissa Bell'],en

The continent has been scrambling to respond after US President Donald Trump announced negotiations would begin “immediately” on ending the conflict following a phone call with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and Trump’s Russia-Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg saying Europe would not be involved.
The summit was confirmed by the Elysée Palace, which said French President Emmanuel Macron would hold an “informal” meeting Monday with “the heads of government of Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission and the Secretary General of NATO.”
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it a “once in a generation” moment for national security.
“The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together,” Starmer was quoted as saying in a statement released by Downing Street on Saturday. “We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face.”
News of the emergency summit follows US President Donald Trump and his top officials upending in recent days what had largely been a united front between Washington and its European NATO allies on supporting Ukraine against Russia’s invasion, which is nearing its third anniversary.
Trump spoke with both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, while his top administration officials visited Europe and presented elements of a vision for ending the war that appeared to allow for key concessions to Russia and raised fears that Ukraine could be marginalized and Europe left out of peacemaking.
The European diplomatic efforts come after new US Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth, speaking in Brussels on Wednesday, said it was unrealistic that Kyiv should join NATO or return to its pre-2014 sovereign borders – an apparent break with Washington’s previous stance and one that critics said gave key concessions to Putin before talks even began.
A day later, Hegseth hedged on those comments, saying “everything is on the table” in negotiations between the two countries. US Vice President JD Vance also warned Thursday the US could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Moscow doesn’t negotiate a peace deal in good faith.
Kellogg said in Munich that Ukraine would be at the table for peace negotiations. But while other European governments’ positions would be taken into consideration, Kellogg said, they would not be participants.
Trump has long been critical of NATO, calling for European partners to spend more on defense and decrying what he sees as an unbalanced relationship between the two sides of the Atlantic with little benefit to the US.
Vance also played into concerns of a deepening breach between Europe and the US under Trump while in Munich on Friday. In a speech, he reprimanded European leaders, telling them that the biggest threat to their security was “from within,” rather than China or Russia, and pointing to what he claimed was their suppression of free speech and refusal to work with hard-right parties in government.
In a post on X Sunday, Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the bloc would “soon come up with new initiatives” on supporting Ukraine and bolstering European security.
Push for peace talks
The US appears tis moving ahead with its own peace process, with administration figures set to meet with senior Russian officials to begin talks aimed at ending the war, according to multiple sources.
National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to travel to Saudi Arabia for the meeting, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN. One of the sources said the meeting will take place in the coming days.
The sources declined to say which Russian officials would be in attendance, but CNN has previously reported the Kremlin is assembling a high-level negotiating team to engage in direct talks with the US, including top-level political, intelligence and economic figures, and Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian official who played a key behind-the-scenes role in a recent US prisoner release deal.
Trump’s call with Putin and the push to work with Russia have also raised Ukrainian fears of being excluded from talks deciding the fate of their own country. Zelensky in recent days lamented that the US president spoke with Putin before him.
Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on stage at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky conceded that he was “not happy” that Trump’s first call was with Putin. The Ukrainian leader warned that it would be even “more dangerous” however if Trump meets in person with the Russian president before him.
Trump hasn’t provided any commitment to meeting Zelensky first, the Ukrainian president told CNN. The US president did however understand the need to “meet urgently” to discuss “concrete plans” to end the war, Zelensky added.
Zelensky sat down with Vance Friday in Munich for what the Ukrainian leader later called a “substantive meeting.”
The following day, in an address to the security conference, Zelensky said his country “will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe.”
The wartime Ukrainian leader also referenced the potential for Europe to be excluded from the new peace push.
“A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at that table. That says a lot,” he said.

It would be two weeks before Russian authorities admitted she was in their custody. The human rights activist and nurse was detained in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, accused of illegal possession of explosives and sentenced to seven years in prison. In her trial, Danilovich testified that she was tortured during her detention.
She has since been deported to a notoriously cruel women’s penal colony in Zelenokumsk, southern Russia. She suffers from constant headaches and her health continues to deteriorate – yet she is not allowed to sit or lie down during the day, according to human rights monitoring group Zmina.
Ukraine has always called its areas under Russian control “temporarily occupied territories,” insisting it will eventually regain control over them. But that hope is being crushed now. This week, US President Donald Trump suggested it was “unlikely” Ukraine would get back much of its occupied land in the peace negotiations he intends to hold with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Danilovich’s case – and she is just one of thousands Kyiv says are detained in Russia – shows what is at stake for Ukraine.
Trump’s comment came after he held a 90-minute phone call with Putin on Wednesday, and it sparked panic across the country, where few believe Putin would negotiate in good faith.
Yuliya Kazdobina, a foreign policy expert at Ukrainian Prism, a think tank, said she doesn’t believe the Russian leader wants peace.
“We already had so many years of negotiations with the Russian side,” she said. Russia has a history of striking and violating agreements with Ukraine going back decades. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for guarantees from the United States, United Kingdom and Russia that they would respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. In 2015, after illegally annexing Crimea and sparking the conflict in eastern Ukraine, Moscow signed a ceasefire agreement only to then repeatedly violate it and then launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine seven years later.
“We know that Russia is very duplicitous, and they can play nice, but when it comes to actually making concessions and making peace, they never… make any concessions,” Kazdobina told CNN.
The view from Kyiv
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to the Trump-Putin call by saying his country would not accept a peace deal struck between the US and Russia without Kyiv’s involvement.
“As an independent country we simply cannot accept any agreements without us. And I articulate this very clearly to our partners. We will not accept any bilateral negotiations on Ukraine without us,” Zelensky said, adding that the fact that Trump spoke to Putin first was “not pleasant.”
And Ukrainians seem to agree with their leader. Speaking to CNN in Kyiv, student Nazar Voloshenko said that any talks that could lead to Ukraine losing further territory would be disastrous for the country.
“We may be left without the currently temporarily occupied territories, without parts of the Kherson region, Zaporizhzhia region and the long-suffering Crimea,” he said. “We must take back what is rightfully ours.”
Russian forces currently occupy nearly 20% of Ukraine’s territory, up from the roughly 7% it controlled before launching its unprovoked full-scale invasion nearly three years ago.
According to Ukrainian officials, some 6 million people, including 1 million children, live under Russian occupation, in what the United Nations has described as a “bleak human rights situation.”
Fears of history repeating itself
Crimea has been under Russian control since Moscow illegally annexed it in 2014. Since then, Russia has imposed a brutal and repressive regime, stomping out any sign of opposition.
Maksym Vishchyk, a lawyer at Global Rights Compliance, a non-profit that advises the Ukrainian authorities on investigating and prosecuting international crimes, said Moscow has repeated the same pattern across other occupied territories.
“When Russia occupied the Crimea peninsula, it commenced a campaign of systematic targeting of communities or individuals it perceived as those who became an obstacle in the Russification campaign … with devastating effects on the social fabric in general, but also communities, families and individuals,” he told CNN.
“And Crimea has been kind of their playbook. Policies and patterns and tactics (Russia) applied in Crimea were then applied as well in other occupied territories. So, we see essentially the same patterns in all occupied territories, both since 2014 and since 2022.”
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has repeatedly reported the myriad human rights violations committed by Russia in occupied Ukraine – from unlawful detentions to sexual abuse to forcing people to accept Russian citizenship and sending their children to Russian schools and training programs.
Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses.
A dangerous precedent
Financial consultant Oleksandr Sokhatskyi told CNN he thinks any deal would be unacceptable if Ukraine’s borders are changed from what they were before the war because of the human cost of years of unnecessary battle.
“Given how many victims this war has already had, and to end it on someone else’s conditions… then why did these (Ukrainian soldiers) die and why did they defend these territories?” he said.
Soldiers fighting on the frontlines were likewise skeptical that negotiations between Trump and Putin could yield a result that would be palatable to many Ukrainians.
Volodymyr Sablyn, a battalion commander in the 66th mechanized brigade, who is fighting near Lyman in the east of the country, said that having Russia take over some of Ukraine’s territory could have dangerous consequences.
“It will set a precedent and show Russia that they can attack any country, take its territory and make it theirs with impunity in the future,” he said, adding that Russia could soon turn their focus on other smaller countries in its vicinity.
Putin has repeatedly made his goals clear: He wants to gain control over the entirety of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. But many in Ukraine are worried that even if he initially agrees to a ceasefire, he will ultimately instigate further fighting to achieve his endgame.
“No one and nothing will stop Putin from attacking us again and occupying another region or several more. If Europe and America don’t help us, then making peace now will most likely lead to war in a few years,” Sablyn said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/europe/russia-ukraine-war-us-white-house-latam-intl/index.html,Russia is relishing a series of contradictory White House messages on Ukraine,2025-02-15 05:00:47,"The split screen is horrifying. On one side, a White House whose policy is in turns strident, revisionist, and then – it seems, sometimes - in urgent need of clarification. On the other, Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelensky is outside, looking in, on peace talks, while hundreds die daily on frontlines where Moscow is winning, and children are frequently pulled from the rubble of Russian airstrikes.
As Ukraine’s brutal war nears its third year, the two visions risk becoming irreconcilable.
The White House’s contradictory positions will be partly to blame here. We have seen a startling week in which the US Secretary of Defence Peter Hegseth said Ukraine could not join NATO or get its pre-2014 borders back. He either broadcast a key plank of US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s secret peace deal inadvertently or gave away a key part of Ukraine’s diplomatic negotiating hand to the shock of Europe.
Ukraine’s allies may have all known that, in reality, it would not join NATO soon, or get its borders back to when the east and Crimea were in its hands, but had kept that as a concession to make to Russia during, not before, negotiations.
It keeps coming.
US Vice President JD Vance told the Wall Street Journal, apparently, the US might send troops to Ukraine, in extremis – that it would use “tools of leverage” both military and economic. Did he really unveil the polar opposite of Hegseth’s comments in Brussels that no American soldiers would go to Ukraine? Why did he not mention Russia at all, when addressing European allies in Munich about largely fictional totalitarianism in western democracies? Also, did Trump misspeak when he said there would be “high-level people” from Russia, Ukraine, and the US in Munich for a key security conference – or did he mean Saudi Arabia?
Moscow and Kyiv didn’t seem to think anyone of that level is going to Munich for those kind of talks. Or are there secret talks happening that Trump cannot keep quiet?
During this short period of whiplash, by the worst battlefield estimates, up to 5,000 troops have been killed or injured on the frontlines in Ukraine. Romania and Moldova have complained of Russian drones interfering in their airspace. At least 13 civilians have died and 72 been injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine. A Russian drone has been fired at Chernobyl nuclear plant, Ukraine said Friday.
A war is happening – and Russia is winning it, at huge cost for Ukraine – while the White House seems to work out what it really thinks in public.
Behind these vacillating positions on NATO membership, Ukraine’s borders and and US troops in Ukraine, lies the darker truth that we simply do not know what Trump and Putin have spoken about, in what Trump has said was more than one call since he came to the White House.
Firstly, it is important to reflect on the precedent here: Trump has swept away three years of isolation of the Kremlin from the West without concessions. He got Marc Fogel released – in exchange, it seems, for Alexander Vinnik, accused of running a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange, gifting Moscow a moment of staggeringly warm rehabilitation for an American television audience. But there have been no concessions so far, in public, from Russia to Ukraine.
Instead, we had the bizarre revisionism of Trump suggesting Russia invaded because Ukraine was about to join NATO.
To repeat, three exhausting years in, Russia invaded Ukraine unprovoked in 2022 out of some strategic sense of concern it needed to project strength along its borders, and mistakenly thinking the invasion would take a matter of weeks, and be welcomed with open arms.
Ukraine wanted warmer relations with the European Union and dreamed of perhaps joining NATO one day, but in the same way Zelensky probably dreamed one day as a young boy of joining the Beatles. Neither was going to happen any time soon.
The revisionist notion that Russia acted to stop Ukraine’s NATO membership is a Kremlin talking point. And it is clear now Trump has spent more time talking to Putin than Zelensky. He even suggested that Zelensky’s time in office might soon end, as he needs to eventually hold elections, and his poll numbers are “not particularly great, to put it mildly”.
It’s hard to understate the impact of the world’s most powerful man suggesting a wartime commander lacks a current mandate and might soon need to step aside. Perhaps this is part of the private plan – it is certainly what Putin wants, as elections would undoubtedly be a mess and produce a mandate that was questioned. It is, above all, potentially catastrophic to Ukrainian morale – soldiers must agree to continue to risk their lives for a president whose key financial backer considers a lame duck.
This is where the two split screens collide.
Trump’s world is one where off-the-cuff statements can be massaged, and his telegenic cabinet overturn the paradigms of global security hourly, without major consequence. Their echo chamber just reassuringly feeds back the corrected version of policy. On the other side of the screen, Ukrainians die, lose territory, see apartment blocks reduced to rubble, consider desertion, and watch the backbone of their western support dissolve.
This is all a symphony of chaos to the Kremlin. They know what their objectives are, which, simply put, amount to whatever they can get. And that is a lot when the key adversary they actually fear, the United States, is so publicly unsure what it wants, why it wants it, and what its red lines are.

The strike hit the concrete shelter that covers the plant’s destroyed former fourth power unit, sparking a fire that was later extinguished, he said. Chernobyl was the site of the 1986 disaster that spread radioactivity across parts of the Soviet Union and Europe.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said that its team at the site heard a large explosion shortly before 2 a.m. local time Friday (7 p.m. ET Thursday).
Despite “significant” damage to the shelter, Zelensky said radiation levels have not increased. Ukraine’s State Emergency Service has also said radiation levels in the area remain within normal limits.
Later on Friday, Chernobyl’s chief engineer Oleksandr Tytarchuk said, “The shelter ceased to fulfill its function” following the damage, according to Ukrainian state media Ukrinform.
“There is a potential risk of radioactive substances being released due to certain actions that may occur at the old shelter facility,” Tytarchuk said.
While Tytarchuk also emphasized that the situation is currently under control he added that repairs may require significant time and effort.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Moscow was not behind the attack.
“Most likely, this is yet another provocation,” Peskov told reporters. “This is exactly the kind of thing the Kyiv regime is known for and sometimes does not hesitate to do.”
Russia has repeatedly been accused by Ukrainian and IAEA officials of risking a major nuclear incident during the conflict. During intense fighting near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in early 2022, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said “every principle of nuclear safety” had been “violated.”
Friday’s reported attack comes two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin and US counterpart Donald Trump held what Trump described as “lengthy and highly productive” telephone call ahead of potential peace talks aimed at bringing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine to an end after nearly three years of grueling war.
In a boost to the Kremlin, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told European leaders in Brussels on Wednesday that Ukraine joining NATO – one of Kyiv’s key requests – is not a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement, and that European security is no longer an American priority.
Other Trump administration officials have, however, taken a tougher stance. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, US Vice President JD Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.
Unit 4 at Chernobyl – near Ukraine’s border with Belarus – exploded in 1986, sparking a radioactive disaster. The reactor was later encased in a concrete and steel sarcophagus.
The sarcophagus was the work of an international coalition and took decades to build. It was finally finished in 2017 and weighs 35,000 tons.
Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, noted that the US “invested a lot of money and effort” in the sarcophagus, which was completed during Trump’s first term.
Ahead of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Yermak said that Ukraine “will give a lot of information to our American partners” about the overnight attack, and the “threats” to nuclear safety he said Russia poses.
The IAEA said its team responded to the explosion within minutes and that no casualties were reported.
Ukraine’s military reported that Russia launched 133 drones across the country in its overnight attack, 73 of which were shot down and 58 of which did not reach their target. The numbers are broadly in line with the recent average of drone attacks. The military said drones were shot down in 11 regions, covering much of the country.
The incident came hours before the beginning of the high-level Munich Security Conference, where Vance is set to meet with Zelensky.
Trump’s unexpected phone call with Putin on Wednesday also sparked fears in Europe of a “dirty deal” being struck to end the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.
Zelensky said the nightly drone attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure meant that Putin “is definitely not preparing for negotiations — he is preparing to continue deceiving the world.”

“There’s a gentleman from Russia. His name is Kirill, and he had a lot to do with this. He was important. He was an important interlocutor, bridging the two sides,” Witkoff told CNN on Wednesday.
Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sanctioned sovereign wealth fund, has been an outspoken Trump supporter from within Russia’s political elite, saying his US presidential election victory “shows that ordinary Americans are tired of the unprecedented lies, incompetence, and malice of the Biden administration.” He added that Trump’s win “opens up new opportunities for resetting relations between Russia and the United States.”

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.
His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who suggested this week that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.
Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.
On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.
“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement sparked fears that a “dirty deal” may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.
Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.
There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.
After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.
Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday said Ukraine would not accept a peace deal negotiated by the United States and Russia alone. He conceded it was “not pleasant” that Trump spoke with Putin before calling Kyiv, calling into doubt the West’s policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” that has largely held over three years of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Both Trump and his defense secretary Pete Hegseth have since said they believe negotiations will involve Ukraine, though Trump, when asked by a reporter on Wednesday if he saw Ukraine as an equal partner in peace negotiations responded only “that’s an interesting question.”
Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, warned against a “quick fix” and a “dirty deal” to end the war, saying that Europe and Ukraine must be at the table for talks because no peace deal can be implemented without their involvement.
For European members of NATO the future suddenly looks a whole lot more uncertain. Since the foundation of the alliance, Europe has relied on the American nuclear umbrella, the deployment of sizable US military contingents in Europe and the vast US defense budget and weapons pipeline.
Trump’s call with Putin, and his subsequent announcement that negotiations would begin immediately on reaching a deal in Ukraine, blindsided European leaders and threatened to leave them with the grunt work of funding and overseeing any settlement.
In other words: Washington will do the deal (and may get paid in rare earth minerals by Ukraine as Trump has demanded), and Europe will pick up the tab.
Hegseth, the newly minted US defense secretary told NATO allies in Brussels that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia. There was also a brutal denial of Ukraine’s aspirations to join the alliance. Hegseth said Washington did “not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome.”
A NATO official subsequently briefed that “NATO membership is not necessarily something that needs to be negotiated with Russia. It’s something that’s a decision for allies and that decision has been linked to when the time is right.”
The official insisted that “the alliance’s position has not changed and Ukraine is still on a path to membership.”
‘Any deal behind our backs will not work’
The Europeans, both in NATO and in the EU – are struggling to be heard as Trump focuses on doing a deal with Putin to end what he has called the pointless bloodshed in Ukraine.
Kallas said that “any deal behind our backs will not work.” She added that “appeasement also always, always fails. So Ukraine will continue to resist and Europe will continue to back Ukraine.”
The allies have been fond of the mantra “No settlement in Ukraine without Ukraine.” That might now be expanded to “…without Ukraine and Europe.” Six European governments, including France, the UK and Germany, said Wednesday night in a panicked joint statement: “We are looking forward to discussing the way ahead together with our American allies.… Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations.”
Speaking to CNN Thursday, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė noted that Europe provided Ukraine with $125 billion in aid last year (much of it financial support), and the US $88 billion, “so I think we earned a place at the table.”
Šakalienė and her Baltic counterparts, on Russia’s borders, are especially anxious at the turn of events. She said there was a stark choice: “Whether we decide to fall under the illusion that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin are going to find a solution for all of us, and that would be a deadly trap, or we will, as Europe, embrace our own economic, financial and military capacity.”
Šakalienė acknowledged that historically the US had been “paying for our security. And that needs to be corrected.”
Her Estonian counterpart, Hanno Pevkur, cited the poet Alexandre Dumas - “One for all, all for one” – as the bedrock of the transatlantic relationship, and also spoke of raising defense spending.
But production lines, investment in new technology and recruitment do not happen overnight. There’s been intense talk since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began of ramping up defense industries in Europe. But that’s a multi-year process.
The head of French defense giant Dassault, Éric Trappier, said last year that “Europe believes all of a sudden that working on defence is a good thing… Between that realisation and the reality of building a European defense industry it’s going to take many years and even many decades,” he told the Financial Times.
Those words were echoed Thursday by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. “We are not producing enough and this is a collective problem…. Russia is producing in three months in ammunition, but the whole of the alliance is producing in a year.”
European weapons manufacturers have also complained about arcane decision-making processes in Brussels, where the European Commission has angled for a much greater role in procurement.
And this sudden increase in spending is expected at a time of sluggish growth and tight public finances.
The events of 1989, when the Soviet bloc evaporated, left a legacy of defense cutbacks in the West that are only now being reversed.
Together, as Zelensky noted this week, Ukraine and Europe have fewer men under arms than Russia. Zelensky is doubtful that Europe or another monitoring force alone is up to the task of securing any peace. “I don’t think any UN troops or anything like that have ever really helped anyone,” he told the Guardian this week. “We are for a (peacekeeping) contingent if it is part of security guarantees, and I would underline again that without America this is impossible.”
With Hegseth saying there is no way the US will commit troops to some sort of 1,000-kilometer long demilitarized zone stretching from the Black Sea to Kharkiv, there is no clarity over what those guarantees might be. Zelensky said Thursday that rather than a contingent of maybe 5,000 peacekeepers, there would need to be 100,000 as part of a “deterrent package.”
Some European ministers fear that Trump fatally misunderstands Putin. German defense minister Boris Pistorius said Thursday he regretted the new administration taking Ukraine’s prospective membership of NATO off the table immediately and added: “Putin is constantly provoking the West and attacking us again. It would be naive to believe the threat would actually diminish after such a peace agreement.”
Their next chance for allies to temper – or at least interrogate – the administration’s strategy will be at this weekend’s Munich Security conference, to be attended by US Vice-President JD Vance and Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.
Europe sidelined?
Moscow, of course, is gloating at the relegation of Europe to bystander. Responding to a question from CNN Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen in Moscow on Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that “many in the West, including the leaders of the European Union, were shocked when a simple, normal conversation took place between two polite, educated individuals.”
Europeans may now be forgiven for glancing backwards to existential moments in their modern history.
One is the Munich agreement of 1938 that gave Hitler free rein to continue Nazi aggression against allies that were neither armed nor ready for war against a fully militarized society.
The other is the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 that suppressed the Prague Spring, an effort at liberalization that threatened Moscow’s dominance of Eastern Europe, just as Ukraine’s sharp tilt to the EU was seen as a threat by Putin.
At that time, US Senator Henry Jackson told NATO parliamentarians that while there was little disagreement in the US about the value of the Atlantic Alliance, there was “a widespread feeling in my country that so many Europeans were less concerned with the security of their homelands than we were.
“To many Americans it has seemed that a prosperous Western Europe was not making a reasonably proportionate contribution to the common defense effort,” Jackson said. “I am convinced that the future vitality of the alliance depends in very large measure on the degree and quality of European efforts to keep NATO strong.”
Fast forward half a century and the demands of the Trump administration that European members of NATO, many of which have struggled to reach a defense spending target of 2% of GDP, are now expected to hit 4 or 5% - (a level higher even than the US) and step beyond that security umbrella.","['Clare Sebastian', 'Tim Lister']",en

Poroshenko, one of Ukraine’s richest men who heads the largest opposition party in Ukraine’s parliament, served as president from 2014 until 2019 when he lost his bid for a second term at an election won by President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The 59-year-old confectionary magnate, sometimes referred to as “the Chocolate King,” sees Zelensky as a long-standing political rival and accused the Ukrainian president of an unconstitutional and politically motivated move.
The domestic spy agency, known as the SBU, said the sanctions were imposed due to “existing threats to national security, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine” and the “creation of obstacles to sustainable economic development.”
Ukraine also announced sanctions against jailed tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, former co-owner of PrivatBank Gennadiy Bogolyubov, Viktor Medvedchuk, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and businessman Kostyantyn Zhevago.
Bogolyubov, Kolomoisky and Medvedchuk could not be reached for comment. Representatives for Zhevago’s company Ferrexpo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“The billions made in what amounted to the sale of Ukraine and Ukrainian interests and Ukrainian security must be blocked and made to work for the protection of Ukraine and Ukrainians,” Zelensky said.
Politics under martial law
The sanctions come amid signs of increasing activity on Ukraine’s political landscape, as a push by U.S. President Donald Trump to end the war with Russia opens up the possibility of a future election.
Martial law, which Ukraine has had since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022, prohibits holding elections. Zelensky’s mandate would normally have ended in May last year.
Before Russia invaded, Poroshenko had been the subject of several criminal investigations. He has always denied wrongdoing.
“When it is made public, people will be shocked how during the war people use funds supposedly set up to support the military (to) launder the money and give it to members of their party,” Zelensky said.
He did not specify who he was referring to, but Poroshenko has both a political party and a wartime charity fund to support the military.
There was a slew of criticism of the sanctions from Poroshenko’s domestic allies, as well as from some figures abroad.
Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister who now serves as co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said the sanctions would damage Zelensky’s reputation in Europe.
“To impose sanctions on Poroshenko will be seen as pure political revenge. Sure, he had business in Russia in the past, but so did Zelensky,” Bildt wrote on X.",[],en

In practice, it was a day that saw the Trump administration upend the alliance’s approach to this almost 3-year-old war, lay out a vision that seemed to deliver some of Moscow’s key demands, and leave NATO allies fighting to avoid the appearance of disunity.
There were, of course, clear signs this was not going to be smooth sailing. US President Donald Trump fired the starting gun on this critical week of diplomacy by pouring cold water on Ukraine’s hopes of a favorable peace deal.
“They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” he said on Fox News on Monday. European leaders have since been tight-lipped about Trump’s comments. “There are different comments now coming out,” said Latvia’s Defense Minister Andris Sprūds on Wednesday, “it is important to see a very clear specific plan.” Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte sidestepped the issue when questioned by CNN at his pre-summit briefing, simply noting, “We are intensely coordinating with President Trump’s team at all levels, and these are very good conversations.”
But coordinating with allies may not be a top priority for the Trump administration. Overnight it has lurched the NATO alliance from a stated policy that Ukraine was on an “irreversible path” to membership, to Hegseth’s blunt statement: “The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement.”
Several of his European counterparts tried to argue the two positions were not incompatible.
“We as a NATO alliance, to which (Hegseth) also gave the firmest possible continuing commitment, have always been clear that Ukraine’s rightful place is in NATO,” said UK Defense Secretary John Healey. “That is a process that will take some time.” He deflected CNN’s question on whether Hegseth’s comment risks the appearance of capitulating to Moscow.
Estonia’s Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur similarly pointed out in an interview with CNN that Hegseth’s statement contained no time frame. “What Pete Hegseth said … is that the outcome of the peace negotiations cannot be the membership of NATO,” he argued. “He didn’t exclude that one day Ukraine can be a member of NATO.”
Whether or not this, or Hegseth’s comment that Ukrainian ambitions to return to pre-2014 borders were “unrealistic,” were meant as a break with previous policy, one thing is clear. “The US is quite happy to march to its own beat and leave Europe and Ukraine to pick up the pieces,” said Matthew Savill, Director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London.
“European countries have to get with the mood music … If they think any US official or politician is going to stick their neck out for Europe, on Europe’s behalf, they are kidding themselves.”
News at the end of the day in Brussels, that while NATO ministers tried to coordinate efforts to counter Russian aggression, President Trump spent 90 minutes on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin is a case in point. Ukraine’s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, when asked about this at a briefing, simply walked away from the cameras.
Amongst all the status-quo-churning statements from the Trump administration, there is one hard truth Europe must face. The 2% defense spending target, which a third of NATO members haven’t even hit yet, is looking increasingly outdated. Hegseth even name-checked his boss to drive the message home.
“Two percent is not enough; President Trump has called for 5%, and I agree,” said Hegseth. “The United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.” And the urgency is not only coming from the US. “If we stick to 2% we cannot defend ourselves in four to five years,” said Rutte. “It is crucial that Russia’s rearmament is met by us.”
On this point, it’s hard to find a NATO minister that wouldn’t say they agree. Still, it is what they actually do that will matter. “We heard (Hegseth’s) call for European nations to step up. We can, and we will,” promised UK Defense Secretary Healey.
And yet the UK’s government has committed to raising its spending only from the current 2.3% level to 2.5% of GDP, without specifying a time period.
Caught between a United States promising “resourcing trade-offs” as it prioritizes the Pacific, and a Russia whose defense industry is already vastly outproducing the EU, this may be a reality NATO’s European members can no longer just agree with.",['Clare Sebastian'],en

The call, which is the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end.
Trump administration officials said they hoped a prisoner “exchange” on Tuesday could portend renewed efforts to end the war, which is about to enter its fourth year.
Now, as the two leaders resume communication after a long period of silence between the White House and Kremlin, the contours of Trump’s settlement plan are coming into clearer focus.
In a readout of the conversation posted on Truth Social, Trump said, “We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.”
“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,” Trump wrote.
Both Washington and Moscow, in their descriptions of the call, suggested the men assumed a conciliatory tone.
“President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, ‘COMMON SENSE.’ We both believe very strongly in it,” Trump wrote, suggesting the former KGB agent on the other end of the line had chosen his words carefully to appeal to the US leader.
The Kremlin said Trump and Putin spoke for nearly 90 minutes.
Trump had been signaling for weeks his desire to speak with Putin as he works to resolve the Ukraine conflict.
As American officials travel in Europe this week, they have begun taking clearer positions on how the conclusion of the Ukraine war might look. Speaking to a conference in Brussels, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kyiv joining NATO is unrealistic and that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration shifts its attention to securing US borders and deterring war with China.
Meanwhile, Trump has spoken of striking a deal with Ukraine’s Zelensky for American access to the country’s valuable rare earth minerals as payment for continued American assistance.
Trump spoke with Zelensky midday, shortly after getting off the phone with Putin.
His predecessor, President Joe Biden, hadn’t spoken to his Russian counterpart in nearly three years, believing there was little to be gained in speaking to a leader he’d deemed a war criminal.
The last US president to visit Russia was Barack Obama in 2013, when he attended a G20 summit. Putin last visited in the United States in 2015 to attend United Nations talks.
Later on Wednesday, Trump indicated that he could soon meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia but cautioned that no formal decision has been made on the matter.
“We think we’re going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia, the first meeting,” Trump said, hours after the two spoke by phone.
The president indicated that Saudi Arabian leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would play a role in the discussions, saying, “We know the crown prince, and I think it’d be a very good place to be.”
A date for that meeting, Trump said, “hasn’t been set,” but he said it could be in the “not too distant future.”
Trump added he has not yet committed to go to Ukraine.
Asked whether Zelensky would be in attendance when he meets with Putin, Trump appeared to suggest he would not be present for the initial meeting: “Probably we’ll have a first meeting and then we’ll see what we can do about the second meeting.”
“I would think about going, I’d think about it, no problem,” he said.
Steve Witkoff, who will be among Trump’s top negotiators on the conflict, pointed earlier Wednesday to the release of wrongfully detained American Marc Fogel as “an indication of what the possibilities are” for the future of Russia’s war in Ukraine.
“I think that’s maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future, and what that may portend for the world at large, for conflict and so forth. I think they had a great friendship, and I think now it’s going to continue, and it’s a really good thing for the world,” he said.
Witkoff met privately with Putin while in Moscow on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/hegseth-ukraine-rules-out-nato-membership/index.html,Hegseth rules out NATO membership for Ukraine and says Europe must be responsible for country’s security,2025-02-12 00:00:00,"US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that the war between Ukraine and Russia “must end,” that Kyiv joining NATO is unrealistic and that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration shifts its attention to securing the US’ own borders and deterring war with China.
In remarks before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, Hegseth also said that European troops should be the primary force securing a post-war Ukraine—something US troops will not be involved in, he added.
“The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,” Hegseth said. And he added that any security guarantees offered to Ukraine “must be backed by capable European and non-European troops.”
“To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine,” he said.
Hegseth also said that a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders, before Russia invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine, “is an unrealistic objective.”
Many NATO allies would actually agree with Hegseth that getting Crimea back from Russia is not realistic, and not even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has insisted on that as a precursor to peace talks. One NATO official said it would have been more concerning if Hegseth had said that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2022 borders was unrealistic.
But the comments about security guarantees are sure to concern Zelensky, who said this week that Europe alone cannot provide meaningful security guarantees to Ukraine without American leadership. Zelensky has also continued to insist that his country joining NATO is the only way to deter Russia from launching new attacks in the future.
Hours after Hegseth spoke, President Donald Trump announced he’d spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday morning. Trump said the two agreed to work “very closely” together and begin negotiations “immediately” on ending the war in Ukraine.
“[W]e will begin by calling President Zelensky, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation,” Trump said. The Kremlin said Wednesday that Putin invited Trump to visit Moscow, which would mark the first visit by a US president since 2013.
Trump spoke with Zelensky shortly after getting off the phone with Putin.
Later on Wednesday afternoon, Trump said he agrees with Hegseth and does not “think it’s practical” to have Ukraine join NATO.
“I don’t think it’s practical to have it. Personally, I know that our new secretary of defense is excellent. Pete made a statement today saying that he thinks it’s unlikely or impractical. I think probably that’s true. I think long before President Putin, they said there’s no way they’d allow that. This has been going on for many, many years. They’ve been saying that for a long time that Ukraine did not go into NATO, and I’m okay with that,” Trump said from the Oval Office.
A European defense official told CNN that while many in NATO don’t necessarily believe Ukraine can join the alliance given the political realities with Russia, they also don’t say so publicly —as Hegseth did — because they want to avoid giving Russia the idea that it can dictate who can and cannot join.
Some former Biden administration officials weighed in quickly on X, saying Hegseth had ceded valuable leverage.
“They just surrendered one of the main points of leverage before negotiations even begin,” said former State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
No new US aid for Ukraine
Hegseth also did not announce any new US aid to Ukraine. “We’re also here today to directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe,” he said.
Hegseth’s comments did not necessarily come as a surprise to the US’ allies. NATO and the European Union had been bracing for the US to step back significantly from the leading role it had been playing since 2022 in providing and coordinating military aid to Ukraine. That is why NATO set up its own security mechanism to help coordinate military assistance to the country.
“We hear your concerns on stepping up for Ukraine, and we hear your concerns on stepping up for European security,” UK Defense Secretary John Healey said in response. “We are and we will.”
The UK may quicky be supplanting the US as Ukraine’s closest western ally. It chaired the meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group for the first time on Wednesday, and Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov issued a lengthy readout of his meeting with Healey at NATO on Wednesday, accompanied by a photo of the pair shaking hands and smiling.
In contrast, Umerov’s description of his meeting with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was one sentence long, accompanied by a photo of them standing side by side, without shaking hands.
And NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said earlier on Wednesday that he “agrees” with Trump “that we must equalize security assistance to Ukraine. But to really change the trajectory of the conflict, we need to do even more.”
And Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans told CNN that “I do agree that as Europe, we should do much more in order to defend our own continent and to safeguard our own security.”
But the US defense secretary’s comments were the clearest articulation yet of how the Trump administration intends to try to decouple itself from Europe and make the Ukraine conflict a fully European problem. It’s a stark departure from the approach of the Biden administration, which made the transatlantic alliance and support for Ukraine the centerpiece of its foreign policy.
The alliance’s smaller, eastern flank countries — those closest to Russia — are particularly worried about the US stepping back.
Latvian Defense Minister Andris Sprūds told CNN that the US is “absolutely indispensable” when it comes to “constraining and containing the aggressor country, Russia.”
Reiterated Trump’s call for allies to up defense spending
Hegseth also echoed calls by Trump for allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, instead of 2%, saying the latter is “not enough.” A senior NATO official told reporters on Wednesday that the “the ask by the US for European allies … to invest more is nothing new,” and agreed that 2% is too low.
Toward the end of his remarks, Hegseth emphasized that the US “remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe. Full stop. But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.”
The European defense official said after Hegseth spoke that there is a general feeling of relief that the US is not planning to pull out of NATO altogether. The sentiment is that as long as the US remains a member of the alliance, there will at least be some room to negotiate on the specifics of the US’ support for Europe and Ukraine.
For now, the US is not halting the military aid to Ukraine that is already flowing from aid packages announced during the previous administration.
But as has long been the case, Ukraine still needs more armored vehicles, long range-weapons and air defense systems, the NATO official told CNN. And Hegseth gave no indications on Wednesday that the US will continue dipping into US military stockpiles to send weapons and equipment to Ukraine, a process known as Presidential Drawdown Authority.
The Department of Defense has not yet done so with the nearly $4 billion in congressionally authorized funds that were left over from the previous administration.
Hegseth also did not outline what a possible negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia might look like. In an interview with Britain’s The Guardian published Tuesday, Zelensky suggested swapping territory seized by Ukrainian forces inside Russia’s Kursk region for Ukrainian territory seized by Russia—but Moscow swiftly rejected the idea.
“Russia has never discussed and will not discuss the topic of exchanging its territory,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.
As CNN reported on Tuesday, there is a hardening consensus within the administration that Putin, rather than Zelensky, will be the main hurdle to getting both sides to the negotiating table. European officials similarly said they’ve seen no signs that Putin is willing to engage in meaningful negotiations.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/china/china-trump-ukraine-war-putin-xi-jinping-intl-hnk/index.html,Trump wants China to play a role in peace in Ukraine. Is Xi Jinping willing to help?,2025-02-12 06:49:10,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
As the war in Ukraine grinds toward its fourth year, US President Donald Trump has made clear which world leader he thinks can help America end the conflict: Vladimir Putin’s ally Xi Jinping.
“Hopefully, China can help us stop the war with, in particular, Russia-Ukraine … they have a great deal of power over that situation, and we’ll work with them,” Trump told political and business elites gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month.
Trump expressed that hope, he has repeatedly said, in a call with the Chinese leader days before being sworn in last month – and it’s a subject that could be raised in the coming days as officials from around the world gather in Munich for an annual security conference.
While Trump may have complicated his plan to orchestrate peace alongside Xi by imposing a blanket 10% tariff on Chinese imports into the United States earlier this month, the war in Ukraine could be a rare issue of collaboration – especially as Beijing looks to avert deepening trade frictions.
“Given the stakes on US-China relations, if Trump prices China’s cooperation as the one critical issue that could improve US-China relations, I think China will be very tempted … (and could) play a helpful role,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. At the same time, she added, Beijing will be wary of undermining its alignment with Russia.
China has long sought to position itself as a potential peace broker in the conflict –promoting its own vaguely-worded proposal to settle the war. But in the West, its bid has so far been overshadowed by another reality: Beijing’s abiding support for Putin’s Russia.
The stakes would be high for Xi to risk damaging that partnership, which the Chinese leader has built up as a critical part of his broader goals to counter pressure from the West and reshape a world order in China’s favor.
And a negotiating table where Xi has a prominent seat is also one where Putin, not Trump, has a staunch partner – a reality that Washington would have to navigate carefully if it doesn’t want to risk isolating European allies or reach a solution that’s unacceptable to Ukraine, analysts say.
“The real outcome that Beijing would like to avoid is a very much weakened Russia,” said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore. “Because then … (Beijing) would be lacking one major partner.”
An end in sight?
The future of the conflict is expected to feature heavily on the agenda of the upcoming Munich Security Conference beginning Friday in Germany, where US Vice President JD Vance is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will also lead a delegation from Beijing.
Looming over the gathering is a dramatic tone shift in Washington’s approach to the war. Trump has questioned American aid to the embattled country, which his predecessor Joe Biden and US NATO allies have seen as critical to defending not just Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but the rules-based world order.
In a Fox News interview earlier this week, the notoriously transactional Trump instead suggested that the US should be getting access to Ukraine’s rich natural resources in exchange for military assistance. He also suggested that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” and said his administration has made “tremendous progress” in laying the groundwork for potential peace talks with Russia and Ukraine, without providing details.
In a series of meetings in Europe this week US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Gen. Keith Kellogg will be urging their European and NATO counterparts to take on a much greater role in supporting Ukraine, defense officials and people familiar with the matter told CNN.
Members of the Trump administration are also set to meet with Ukrainian officials in the coming days, with sources telling CNN that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to travel to Kyiv for discussions about the country’s critical mineral deposits, while Kellogg is also set to visit the country following meetings in Munich.
Zelensky has said he is willing to negotiate with Putin – but only if the US and Europe continue to support Ukraine and “provide security guarantees,” while Russia in recent days reiterated that it would only accept a peace that saw Ukraine give up ambitions to join NATO and cede regions annexed by Russia.
But while Trump is pushing for a swift end to the war, his administration has yet to lay out specifics on what kind of peace terms they are hoping to see agreed upon.
How much Trump would look to work alongside Xi – and whether the Chinese leader is amenable – may also depend to an extent on those parameters, observers say. Western leaders in the past have tried, without success, to persuade Xi to push Putin toward a peace in line with the one advocated for by Zelensky and Ukraine.
Even as China has claimed neutrality in the conflict and called for peace, it’s emerged as a key diplomatic and economic lifeline for Russia throughout the war, including by sending it dual-use goods NATO leaders have said are feeding Russia’s defense sector and enabling its military. Beijing defends its trade as part of normal relations with Russia.
It’s likely that in Trump’s eyes, all that gives Xi leverage over Putin. But close observers of China’s foreign policy say it’s not so straightforward.
“Can China threaten to cut off the supply (of essential goods to Russia)? It can’t, because China cannot afford a completely failed Russia,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong. He pointed to Beijing’s calculus that its relations with the US and Europe have already soured to such an extent that they have no choice but to continue to back their only powerful diplomatic ally.
Xi and Putin memorably declared their “no limits” partnership weeks before Russian tanks rolled over Ukraine’s sovereign borders – a pledge made based on their shared opposition to NATO and a view that the US-led West is declining while they are on the rise.
Xi also sees Putin as a potential source of economic and diplomatic support if Beijing were ever to invade Taiwan, some observers say. Xi’s ambition to take control of the self-ruling democracy may be another key reason why he would be wary of any move that could harm that relationship.
The Chinese leader may also be enjoying the war’s role as a distraction for the US away from a focus on Asia and Taiwan – something Trump’s cohort, including Vice President Vance, have pointed out.
As a US senator, Vance last year argued that the US supplying Ukraine with air defense systems could hurt its ability to aid Taiwan’s defense if China were to attack the island that it claims as its own.
Xi as peacemaker?
Working with Trump to pressure Putin to a negotiating table – whatever the terms of a deal – would also mark a stark shift in Beijing’s approach to the conflict so far.
Xi and his officials have used the war as a platform to promote a vision for a China-led world, one where the American alliance system has been dismantled or weakened.
“China focuses on building a coalition of non-Western nations, including influential developing countries like Brazil, to leverage the Ukraine conflict toward reshaping global security architecture and advancing an alternative vision of world order,” said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in the US.
Beijing will have little incentive to engage in substantial cooperation with Washington for now, said Zhao, noting that its officials would, however, wait and see what benefits could be gained from any potential, broader deal-making with Trump.
That said, the current American president – a NATO critic, who has repeatedly voiced personal admiration for Putin and Xi – may be a more appealing negotiating partner for both strongmen.
Trump before taking office called for an “immediate ceasefire and negotiations” – a position that jibes with Beijing’s stated stance on the war that has been criticized by the West as helpful to Russia. He’s also in recent weeks echoed Moscow and Beijing’s talking points, sympathizing with the Kremlin’s view that Ukraine should not be part of NATO and that the war continued because America “started pouring equipment” into Ukraine.
US lawmakers and some members of Trump’s administration remain tough on both countries. But Trump’s stance raises the question of whether there is a deal that Beijing, Moscow and Washington could orchestrate that would please all three – and what that could mean for Ukraine and the future of the conflict.
“You can see how each could take something from (certain peace deals) – Putin can save face, Xi and Trump can claim to be peacemakers,” said Robert Ward, director of geo-economics and strategy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Britain.
But there’s a risk in any agreement where Russia is left in possession of the parts of Ukraine it’s now occupying that this becomes “a conflict that isn’t at an end, it’s just a lull,” he said.",['Simone McCarthy'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/politics/hegseth-ukraine-nato-europe/index.html,Hegseth expected to push NATO and EU to take more responsibility for Ukraine,2025-02-11 21:47:41,"New US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to assume the role of backseat driver in his first in person meeting with European counterparts on Wednesday as the new Trump administration works to shift responsibility for Ukrainian and European security squarely to NATO and the EU.
Notably, the meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels will be chaired by the United Kingdom. Under the Biden administration, the gatherings were convened by the US, which founded the group just after Russia’s invasion in 2022.
In a series of meetings in Europe this week Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Donald Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Gen. Keith Kellogg, will be urging their European and NATO counterparts to take on a much greater role in supporting Ukraine, defense officials and people familiar with the matter told CNN.
To that end, on Thursday at a NATO defense ministers meeting, Hegseth is expected to urge members to increase their defense spending to 5% of their respective GDPs and ramp up their defense industrial base to start manufacturing weapons and equipment more quickly, defense officials said.
But the US’ allies are still waiting to see what Hegseth requests of them behind closed doors, one NATO official told CNN. Two other European officials said they’ve heard nothing “concrete” in terms of the administration’s plans for Ukraine, and that they’re wary of trusting any statement of policy that doesn’t come directly from Trump himself.
“Who is really calling the shots?” asked one official.
To that point, Kellogg told Newsmax that while he will discuss a vision for peace with allies at the Munich Security Conference this week, “the person who will present the peace plan is the president of the United States, not Keith Kellogg.”
But Kellogg has been meeting with other countries backing Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the meetings. Just last week he met with more than a half dozen ambassadors from Washington for pre-Munich discussions that will involve more senior ministers and officials from a variety of countries.
A European official who recently sat down with Kellogg said the administration still seems to be “collecting ideas, options, both sticks and carrots. And that while these ideas may be important, ultimately no one knows when and how President Trump will move.”
The official added, however, that Kellogg had an “overwhelming confidence and belief that Trump will negotiate a strong deal. On the other hand, what constitutes a strong deal remains yet to be defined.”
In a sign that the Trump administration is pursuing multiple channels to try to get a Russia-Ukraine peace deal, the White House announced on Tuesday that the US had secured the release of US citizen Marc Fogel from Russian detention.
The release, part of a broader exchange with Russia, was negotiated by Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and “serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,” said national security adviser Mike Waltz.
Future of US aid to Ukraine remains uncertain
NATO and European officials, meanwhile, say they have been able to glean little from Hegseth’s first few weeks as secretary, during which he has focused on domestic culture war issues like eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the US military and surging military assets to the US southern border, where Marines and soldiers have helped with logistical tasks like building barriers and shuttling migrants to and from detention facilities.
So far, there are no signs that the Pentagon under Hegseth will continue dipping into US military stockpiles to send weapons and equipment to Ukraine, a process known as Presidential Drawdown Authority. The Department of Defense has not yet done so with the nearly $4 billion in congressionally authorized funds that were left over from the previous administration.
Trump told Fox on Sunday that he wants “the equivalent of like $500B worth of rare earth” minerals from Ukraine’s critical mineral deposits in exchange for continued US aid to Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to travel to Kyiv this week for discussions about the minerals, two people familiar with his plans told CNN. Trump confirmed on Tuesday that Bessent will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this week in Ukraine.
A source familiar with the administration’s thinking on US investment in Ukraine’s natural resources said the plan could involve the US ultimately securing priority access to Ukrainian minerals, backed by US financing and with the participation of American companies. That would give the US a stake in Ukrainian security, too, which appeals to Kyiv, this person said.
The Trump administration has not cut off aid to Ukraine entirely — military assistance from packages announced under the previous administration is still flowing, and Kellogg has advocated for continuing to provide lethal assistance if Kyiv agrees to enter peace talks with Moscow.
But it’s still unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would agree to do so without obtaining guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO — a demand that has long been a nonstarter for Zelensky.
There is a hardening consensus within the administration, meanwhile, that Putin, rather than Zelensky, will be the main hurdle to getting both sides to the negotiating table, said one source familiar with the White House’s thinking on this issue. European officials similarly said they’ve seen no signs that Putin is willing to engage in meaningful negotiations.
Part of Kellogg’s task at the Munich Security Conference this week will be to push the Europeans to do more to get Putin to the table, said another source familiar with his upcoming travel.
Zelensky has indicated he would be willing to “soften his position” on territorial concessions, Kellogg told Fox last week. But Putin has not changed any of his demands in the nearly three years of war or indicated that Russia would concede any seized territory.
Trump has threatened Russia with more sanctions if it does not begin peace talks. But that ultimatum has not been well-received by Moscow.
“The Russian army will [end the war] within the timeframe set by its supreme commander-in-chief, our president Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,” one Russian lawmaker said on Russian state TV last month.
‘Increased European leadership’ on Ukraine
In a statement previewing Hegseth’s trip, the Defense Department twice mentioned that Hegseth would be emphasizing to NATO and EU allies the need for “increased European leadership,” including when it comes to security assistance to Ukraine and an increase in defense spending overall.
NATO and Europe began planning for a US retreat from the conflict last year and started taking on more responsibility for aid to Ukraine, with NATO setting up its own mechanism to funnel assistance to Kyiv. It’s the first time the UK has chaired a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a coalition of over 50 countries focused on streamlining the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine.
The forum was first convened by former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin just weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and had been led by the US in every meeting since its inception. It’s still not clear who will chair the forum’s subsequent meetings.
Hegseth spoke briefly about Ukraine during his confirmation hearing, describing Ukraine as “the good guy” and Russia as “the aggressor,” while reiterating Trump’s refrain that the war “needs to come to an end.” But the Trump administration has not yet articulated a clear plan for doing so.
During that same hearing, Hegseth referred to Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea as a “minor incursion,” which has raised questions among some of the US’ European and NATO allies about whether he takes Putin’s long-held fixation with controlling Ukrainian territory seriously.
That obsession is largely why Zelensky has insisted on security guarantees from the US and Europe before Ukraine agrees to begin peace talks with Putin. Should Russia try to invade Ukraine again in the future, Zelensky wants promises that the west will help come to Kyiv’s defense.
But Waltz told NBC on Sunday that the US will not be providing Ukraine with any security guarantees whatsoever. And he suggested that Ukraine will have to start paying the US if it wants to keep receiving American military assistance, something Trump alluded to last week when he said he “wants” Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.
“We need to recoup those costs and that is going to be a partnership with the Ukrainians in terms of their natural resources and their oil and gas and also buying ours,” the national security adviser said. “Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward. President Trump is going to end it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.’’
One key topic of discussion when it comes to security guarantees will be the possible deployment of European peacekeepers to Ukraine after a deal is reached — something the UK and France have been discussing, people familiar with the matter told CNN.
The US would not send troops for peacekeeping, sources explained, but allies have signaled they would need American “enablers” to make a peacekeeping force viable. That would likely include help with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance to help protect the force as well as additional air defense systems.","['Natasha Bertrand', 'Zachary Cohen', 'Alex Marquardt']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html,"Ukraine ‘may be Russian someday,’ Trump says ahead of Vance-Zelensky meeting",2024-09-27 00:00:00,"US President Donald Trump suggested that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” throwing into question the future independence of a sovereign country that, with Western backing, has defended itself against Moscow’s full-scale invasion for nearly three years.
Trump discussed his administration’s effort to end the war in an interview with Fox News that aired Monday, ahead of a meeting tabled for this week between his vice president, JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
“They (Ukraine) may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” Trump said. He stressed that he also wanted to see a return on investment with US aid for Ukraine, again floating the idea of a trade for Kyiv’s rare earth minerals.
The US president’s comments will likely delight the Kremlin, which has illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions since launching its full-scale invasion and seeks Ukraine’s total submission.
“A significant part of Ukraine wants to become Russia, and the fact that it has already become Russia is (undeniable),” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday, when asked about Trump’s comments.
When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, it believed it would capture the capital Kyiv in days and the rest of the country in weeks. With the war set to enter its fourth year later this month, Moscow holds around a fifth of Ukraine’s territory. In 2023, it held a sham referendum in four occupied regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – in an attempt to lend legitimacy to its annexation.
Peskov said people had “despite many dangers, stood in line and voted” in the referendum to join Russia. “This largely corresponds to President Trump’s words,” he added. CNN reported at the time on the stage-managed referendum, which international observers dismissed as a propaganda exercise.
In the Fox News interview, Trump said his administration had made “tremendous progress” in laying the ground for potential peace talks with Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky said Monday that “some serious people” from the Trump administration will visit Ukraine this week ahead of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, where Zelensky is set to meet with Vance.
Trump repeated his interest in reaping a return on US assistance for Kyiv. “They have tremendously valuable land in terms of rare earth, in terms of oil and gas, in terms of other things. I want to have our money secured,” he said.
“I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion of rare earth, and they’ve essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don’t feel stupid. Otherwise we’re stupid. I said to them, we have to get something. We can’t continue to pay this money,” he added.
Whereas the Biden administration said its support for Kyiv was to defend “the right of people to determine their own futures,” and to maintain “the principle that a country can’t change its neighbor’s borders by force,” Trump’s comments reinforce his more transactional approach to geopolitics.
Trump’s comments will likely come as a boon to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine by falsely asserting that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people – a single whole,” and that Ukraine is not a sovereign country.
With some European leaders preparing to meet senior members of the Trump administration in Munich this week, Poland’s President Andrzej Duda stressed on Tuesday that Russia “cannot draw benefit” from its war in Ukraine and should not emerge victorious.
Speaking to CNN on the sidelines of the World Government Summit in Dubai, Duda said that in a “perfect scenario Ukraine should regain all the land that is occupied by Russia today,” but conceded that the priority now is to ensure that “the war is stopped” not according to “Russian conditions.”","['Christian Edwards', 'Anna Chernova', 'Edward Szekeres']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/10/europe/trump-zelensky-ukraine-russia-analysis-intl/index.html,"Ukraine: Trump pushes for quick end to war, but much could go very wrong",2025-02-08 00:00:00,"Like an object floating upward yet still underwater, the bare, vague bones of a peace plan for Ukraine are taking shape. Despite a relative silence in policy announcements on this war from an otherwise vocal Trump administration, the next two weeks may see significant route markers planted in public. Whether they gain any traction with the Kremlin remains unclear.
Last week, US President Donald Trump officially appointed 80-year-old retired Gen. Keith Kellogg as his envoy to Ukraine and Russia. Almost Kellogg’s first act was to announce he would discuss their vision for peace in Ukraine with allies at the Munich Security Conference, on February 14-16. He is then expected, four days later, to visit Kyiv, for his first, long-anticipated trip there, according to Ukrainian state media.
Kellogg’s every utterance is parsed by an anxious Kyiv. He hit back at suggestions that the Munich conference would see the outline of a peace plan revealed publicly, telling Newsmax: “The person who will present the peace plan is the president of the United States, not Keith Kellogg.” Trump will have the potential big reveal, it seems, after Kellogg consults with allies in Germany.
Trump has tried to kickstart the process, it seems in recent days, telling The New York Post Saturday he had spoken to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about ending the war, but providing no details. The Kremlin declined to confirm that call, but spokesman Dmitri Peskov told CNN: “There could be something I don’t know.”
You might expect a complex, diplomatic symphony to strike up to try and end the largest war in Europe since the 1940s. Instead, in public at least, a scrappy version of online karaoke has the players involved struggling to hold together the same tune.
Trump has been surprisingly vocal about the need to end the conflict, but short of public ideas. He floated the idea of meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this week. Yet no date has been set, and Trump’s comments seemed an off-the-cuff response to a question about whether his ambitious Vice President JD Vance would meet Zelensky in Munich. In truth, we do not know how much is happening in private. The Kremlin has hinted at “intensified” discussions, and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has spoken of private efforts.
Unusually, Kellogg’s blueprint for peace has been public since April, providing a stable frame of reference against which to compare any real details of a deal. In short, it involved Ukraine getting more military aid conditioned on negotiations, and a ceasefire, followed by possible European peacekeepers along the frontlines.
Kellogg has also suggested an initial ceasefire might be time for elections in Ukraine, if any truce can take hold. A putative timetable for any deal appeared in Ukrainian media this week, suggesting a ceasefire around Easter in late April, a peace conference and wider deal in May, but only presidential elections for the country in August. This was also flatly rejected as fake by the presidency. But the leaks, confected or not, will keep coming, as all sides try to float or reject ideas.
It is hard to not interpret a call for elections as a way to have Zelensky slowly step aside, and perhaps offer a sweetener to get the Kremlin to the table. The Ukrainian leader’s animosity is insurmountable toward Putin, whose invasion has laid waste to swathes of Ukraine and allegedly committed war crimes against its citizens. Zelensky and the US president also had a fraught relationship during his first term over Trump’s demand to investigate the Biden family.
Zelensky is now entering a phase where the two most powerful voices in any peace deal don’t share the widespread adulation he has enjoyed from the West for three years.
Talk of elections has sparked unchecked speculation around Kyiv about Zelensky’s future. He has given lengthy interviews in the past week, appearing at times angry and anxious that Ukraine might not be front and center of any talks. In his daily address Thursday he was “sure” there was no official peace plan “yet.” He added: “What is in certain publications, again, I’m sure, maybe I’m wrong, but I’m sure that this is not an official plan of President Trump.” His senior staff have spoken to Kellogg and Waltz in recent days, they have said. But Zelensky is no longer an insurmountable figure.
Leading some polls, in any future Ukrainian presidential election, is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the military chief Zelensky fired last year. Zalyuzhnii is currently the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Kingdom, and was pictured recently meeting the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy in Kyiv.
Elections in Ukraine are currently delayed as part of martial law, the valid argument for that being that the country – under constant bombardment, with millions of its people physically at war or refugees abroad, and fending off an aggressive neighbor who has vigorously meddled in its votes for two decades – can’t have a free and fair election until there is peace. But an initial ceasefire might provide that calm, and even a chance for Zelensky to step back and provide an opportunity for a fresh face, without the uncomfortable history Ukraine’s current leader has with Trump’s first term, to negotiate a wider deal. Zalzyuzhnii could command the loyalty of Ukraine’s armed forces into a less-than perfect accommodation with Moscow.
But a lot could also go very wrong. Electoral chaos might engender an imperfect or challenged result. More pro-Russian sentiment might make its way onto the ballot, through hacking, or malfeasance. The threat of corruption investigations is leaving many officials concerned about their own fate. It is the sort of mess you would expect in wartime, and why elections could be one complexity too far.
This conflict has defined itself as one of the unexpected. Zelensky has been likened to a modern Winston Churchill, providing the West the spine it did not know it needed. It would be in keeping with the war’s wild vacillations that he steps aside at Ukraine’s moment of greatest vulnerability.
Another hurdle for peace is whether the Kremlin wants it now, or at all. They are currently winning on the battlefield – not at pace, but they are taking ground. Russian forces appear to have taken the city of Toretsk and may soon capture Pokrovsk, deeper into Ukraine’s Donetsk region. This would also leave them with relatively open ground all the way to the key cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. It is unclear why Russia would seek to freeze its frontline progress when Ukraine, in the words of one frontline soldier to CNN, “doesn’t have much to say about it.”
This week will see fragments of the private – or spontaneously imagined – plan for peace emerge into the public domain. Each nuance effects the lives of millions of Ukrainians and dictates security in Europe for decades. Even Taiwan is safer if Russia is not emboldened. They can only hope, as the silhouette of a plan drifts toward the surface, that it is as serious as the moment.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

Planned for many years, the complex switch away from the grid of their former Soviet imperial overlord is designed to integrate the three Baltic nations more closely with the European Union and to boost the region’s energy security.
“We did it!,” Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said in a post on social media X.
After disconnecting on Saturday from the IPS/UPS network, established by the Soviet Union in the 1950s and now run by Russia, the Baltic nations cut cross-border high-voltage transmission lines in eastern Latvia, some 100 meters (328 feet) from the Russian border, handing out pieces of chopped wire to enthusiastic bystanders as keepsakes.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, herself an Estonian, earlier this week called the switch “a victory for freedom and European unity.”
The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after power cable, telecom links and gas pipeline outages between the Baltics and Sweden or Finland. All were believed to have been caused by ships dragging anchors along the seabed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has denied any involvement.
Poland and the Baltics deployed navy assets, elite police units and helicopters after an undersea power link from Finland to Estonia was damaged in December, while Lithuania’s military began drills to protect the overland connection to Poland.
Analysts say more damage to links could push power prices in the Baltics to levels not seen since the invasion of Ukraine, when energy prices soared.
The IPS/UPS grid was the final remaining link to Russia for the three countries, which re-emerged as independent nations in the early 1990s at the fall of the Soviet Union, and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004.
The three staunch supporters of Kyiv stopped purchases of power from Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but have relied on the Russian grid to control frequencies and stabilize networks to avoid outages.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/world/ukraine-kursk-trump-ceasefire-talks-intl/index.html,"As Trump pushes for ceasefire talks, Ukraine sees Kursk as a potential bargaining chip",2024-08-11 00:00:00,"Ukraine has launched new attacks in Russia’s southern Kursk region as US President Donald Trump pushes for ceasefire talks.
The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said that Ukrainian forces launched a new series of assaults in the Kursk region on Thursday, advancing up to five kilometres (three miles) behind Russian lines southeast of Sudzha.
While it is not clear whether the attacks are aimed at seizing more territory or reinforcing Ukraine’s defensive positions, ISW analyst Angelica Evans said advances of such scale were impressive.
“To see the Ukrainians able to penetrate Russian defenses, and advance up to five kilometers, that’s something that we don’t see the Russians able to do anywhere in the front line,” she told CNN in an interview.
Kyiv surprised even its allies with its attack on Russian territory and keeps fighting in Kursk even as it faces extremely difficult situations elsewhere along the frontline.
Russia claimed on Friday that it has now taken over Toretsk, an industrial town in eastern Ukraine that has been one of the epicenters of the fight for the past six months. Ukraine has not commented on the claim, but if confirmed, the fall of Toretsk would be another strategic win for Moscow as it would bring Russian troops closer to important Ukrainian defensive positions.
At the same time, Russian troops have been inching towards Pokrovsk, a logistic hub in eastern Ukraine that has been in Russia’s sight since the summer, and Kupiansk in the north.
Some in Ukraine, including some troops fighting in Kursk and elsewhere, are questioning Kyiv spending precious resources in Russia when it is struggling to defend its own territory.
The answer likely comes down to the expectation that Trump might start pressuring Ukraine to agree to talks with Russia soon.
“There’s nothing inherently valuable about the actual land that the Ukrainians are holding in Kursk. It’s fields and settlements, they’re not threatening Kursk city or making a run on Moscow,” Evans said.
“But when we’re thinking about peace negotiation, holding Russian territory could be a critical asset for the Ukrainians when they’re thinking about bargaining for their own territory back or for other things that they might want from the Russians in future peace negotiation,” she added.
Ukraine’s military and political leaders have repeatedly said that the Kursk operation was aimed at preventing a new Russian offensive in northern Ukraine and forcing Moscow to redeploy some of its troops from elsewhere in Ukraine.
The country’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday North Korean troops returned to battle in the Kursk region following earlier reports of the units being pulled back from the fighting after suffering mass casualties. He said hundreds of North Korean and Russian troops were “eliminated” while battling Ukrainian forces.
The incursion was Ukraine’s biggest strategic gain since the liberation of Kherson in November 2022 and it gave the country a major morale boost.
But this week, as Trump continued his calls for negotiations to end the war, Zelensky made it clear Kyiv sees Kursk as a potential bargaining chip.
Speaking on Wednesday, he called the incursion “a very important operation.”
”You will see later, when we reach a diplomatic settlement to end the war, what conditions the Russians will face with regard to the Kursk direction,” he said in his nightly address to the nation.
Trump has made it clear he wants talks between Russia and Ukraine to start “as quickly as possible.” He said that his administration is in direct contact with both Russia and Ukraine.
“We made a lot of progress on Russia, Ukraine,” Trump said. “We’ll see what happens. We’re going to stop that ridiculous war,” Trump said on Monday.
Rare strategic gain for Ukraine
It’s been six months since Kyiv launched its surprise incursion into the Kursk region and while Russia has managed to reclaim more than half of the territory initially ceased by Kyiv, this came at a huge cost to Moscow.
The Ukrainian General Staff said Thursday that Russia lost 40,000 troops over the six months of fighting in Kursk – 16,100 of whom were killed.
“Ukrainian forces captured 909 Russian military personnel, significantly replenishing the exchange fund. This allowed hundreds of Ukrainian defenders who were in Russian prisons to return home,” the General Staff added.
The incursion marked the first time foreign troops took control of Russia’s territory since World War II – a huge embarrassment for the Russian President Vladimir Putin who has largely framed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as means to “defend” the country.
The Ukrainian military has estimated that Russia deployed some 78,000 troops into Kursk, several times as many as Ukraine has. “These Russian forces, which include elements of elite units, are tied up and really distracted in Kursk. [Otherwise] they would more than likely be fighting on the frontlines in eastern Ukraine where they could do a lot of damage,” Evans said.
Yet despite the numerical advantage, the Russian military struggled to push the Ukrainians out of its territory and so Moscow eventually called in foreign reinforcements, deploying some 12,000 North Korean soldiers into the Kursk region.
By doing so, Putin became the first Russian leader ever to have to rely of foreign troops to liberate Russian soil, according to Evans.
She said that the strategic impact of the gains made by the Ukrainian troops deployed into Kursk were “significantly greater than these forces could have achieved defending within Ukraine.”
“The military activity isn’t going to collapse the Russian state, but the pressures that they’re putting on the Russians are things that could,” she added, saying that discontent is growing within Russia over the fact that Ukraine has been able to hold onto Russian territory for six months. “That is something that really hurts Putin’s credibility within Russia, and this vision that he’s created for himself as a defender and stabilizer.”
Speaking to the acting governor of Kursk region Alexander Khinshtein on Wednesday, Putin admitted the situation in Kursk was “very difficult.”
Yet the North Korean troops did little to help Russia regain its territory, with Russia using them mostly as foot soldiers who carry out brutal mass ground assaults that lead to huge casualties.
Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence said around 4,000 of those North Korean troops have been killed or injured. The South Korean intelligence service said earlier this week that the North Korean troops deployed to Kursk have not engaged in combat since mid-January, according to local media, confirming earlier reports by the Ukrainian military.
Evans said that Russia is struggling to repel Ukrainian forces because of Kyiv’s superior use of technology, mostly drones and electronic warfare interference technology.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/europe/ukraine-france-mirage-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"Ukraine gets French Mirage fighter jets, more F-16s from the Netherlands",2023-08-20 00:00:00,"Ukraine’s air force got a boost in its fight against Russia on Thursday with the arrival of Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets from France, along with F-16s from the Netherlands.
French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu confirmed the transfer of the Mirage jets in a post on X, adding the fighters were flown by Ukrainian pilots who have been training for months in France. French President Emmanuel Macron had promised the Mirage jets to Ukraine last summer.
“The Ukrainian sky is becoming more secure!” Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a post on Facebook.
Welcoming the arrival of “the first French Mirage 2000 fighter jets and F-16s from the Kingdom of the Netherlands,” Umerov said: “These modern combat aircraft have already arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin carrying out combat missions, strengthening our defense and enhancing our ability to effectively counter Russian aggression.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Macron on Thursday for “his leadership and support.”
“France’s president keeps his word, and we appreciate it,” Zelensky said in a post on X.
The new fighters are expected to boost Ukrainian forces’ ability to provide air cover for troops, attack ground targets, take on enemy planes, and intercept missiles.
The latter role could be vital. Russia has stepped up missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, often sending dozens in one night, taxing Ukraine’s air defense batteries.
Last weekend, a Russian strike on a residential building in central Ukraine killed at least 14 people, emergency services said.
In January, the Ukrainian Air Force reported in a Facebook post that one of its F-16 pilots had destroyed six Russian missiles in one night in December.
Military aviation analyst Peter Layton at the Griffith Asia Institute said the Mirages might be best suited for the air defense role, freeing up the F-16s for other missions.
Mirages can get airborne more quickly than an F-16, Layton said.
“I would have the (Mirages) standing ground alert and able to take off within a few minutes to intercept incoming cruise missiles (primary targets) and Shahed drones (secondary targets),” Layton said.
Mirages could also be used to launch longer-range missiles such as the SCALP, also known as the Storm Shadow, at targets well inside Russia, said Layton, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer.
CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton noted that the Mirages could provide Ukraine with another platform to attack Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, as the jets can carry French-made Exocet anti-ship missiles.
Ukraine’s air fleet
Ukraine needs all the help it can get in its nearly three-year long war, triggered by Russia’s 2022 invasion of its neighbor.
There has been no let-up in the fighting, even with US President Donald Trump having promised to reach a ceasefire quickly with his return to the White House last month.
Ukraine’s army continues to be pushed back on the eastern front lines, in the face of superior Russian manpower and resources.
Thursday’s announcements did not specify the number of fighter jets transferred from the two NATO allies to Ukraine, but the country has to date had few Western warplanes in its fleet.
Ukraine received its first F-16s last summer, with Zelensky at the time thanking the Netherlands, Denmark and the United States – where the F-16s are built – for the aircraft, without saying how many were delivered.
Reports since indicate two F-16s have been lost. A list of the world’s combat aircraft from Flight Global shows two F-16s in Ukraine’s fleet as of the beginning of this year, with 58 on order.
France had 26 Mirage 2000-5s active in its air force at the beginning of 2025, according to Flight Global. The aircraft are the oldest jets in France’s fleet and are slated to be replaced by Rafale jets in the coming years. It is not known how many will be transferred to Ukraine.
Leighton said current estimates show Ukraine getting a total of 95 F-16s and around two dozen Mirages.
“Neither airframe will be made available to Ukraine in sufficient numbers to provide the air combat capabilities Ukraine needs at this stage in its war with Russia,” he added. “In ideal circumstances, the Ukrainian Air Force should have around 200 - 220 fighter jets at its disposal.”",['Brad Lendon'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/world/trump-ukraine-minerals-military-aid-intl/index.html,Ukraine’s mineral riches have long been eyed by its allies. Now they may be Trump’s price for military aid,2025-02-04 16:54:22,"US President Donald Trump has said he wants access to Ukraine’s mineral deposits in exchange for future military aid that Kyiv needs as it continues to defend itself against Russia’s aggression.
While the comment highlighted Trump’s transactional approach to the war in Ukraine, it was not entirely unexpected. The US and other Western countries have eyed Ukraine’s mineral riches for a long time.
“We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do (that),” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, without specifying what, if anything, Ukraine had agreed to do.
He has previously suggested that any future assistance should be provided as a loan and would be conditioned on Ukraine negotiating with Russia.
Under former US President Joe Biden, the US had provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.
Biden argued the aid was necessary because Ukraine’s victory was key to America’s own security. Trump, however, has made it clear he doesn’t believe the US should continue providing assistance without getting something in return.
While Trump did not give any details on what he wants from Kyiv, a deal outlining a deeper cooperation between the US and Ukraine on minerals had been in the works for months before he took office in January.
A memorandum of understanding prepared under the Biden administration last year said the US would promote investment opportunities in Ukraine’s mining projects to American companies in exchange for Kyiv creating economic incentives and implementing good business and environmental practices.
Ukraine already has a similar agreement with the European Union, signed in 2021.
Adam Mycyk, a partner in the Kyiv office of the global law firm Dentons, said that while the objective of the deal – securing critical mineral supplies from Ukraine – remains unchanged, Trump’s approach seems to be more transactional.
“It remains to be seen what form such an agreement could take, but it would be in Ukraine’s best interests for its post-war recovery and long-term economic prospects to maximize as much as possible the processing and value creation of any extracted minerals in Ukraine by Ukrainian companies,” Mycyk told CNN.
Kyiv has not yet responded to Trump’s comments, but the Ukrainian government has in the past made the argument that its mineral deposits are one of the reasons the West should support Ukraine – to prevent these strategically important resources from falling into Russian hands.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has specifically mentioned the possibility of future investments in the country’s natural resources by its Western allies as a key part of his “Victory plan.”
“The deposits of critical resources in Ukraine, along with Ukraine’s globally important energy and food production potential, are among the key predatory objectives of the Russian Federation in this war. And this is our opportunity for growth,” Zelensky said in a statement outlining the plan in October.
Nataliya Katser-Buchkovska, the co-founder of the Ukrainian Sustainable Investment Fund, said a deal that would bring US investment into Ukraine’s mining sector would be beneficial for both sides.
The US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs, many of which come from China. Of the 50 minerals classed as critical, the US was entirely dependent on imports of 12 and more than 50% dependent on imports of a further 16, according to the United States Geological Survey, a government agency.
Ukraine, meanwhile, has deposits of 22 of these 50 critical materials, according to the Ukrainian government.
“It is not only a crucial step for Ukraine’s post-war economic recovery, but it’s also a chance for the US to address global supply chain issues,” said Katser-Buchkovska, who served as a member of the Ukrainian Parliament from 2014 to 2019 and was the head of a parliamentary committee on energy security and transition.
China’s global dominance
Although Trump used the term “rare earths,” it is unclear whether he intended to refer specifically to rare earth minerals – a group of 17 elements that exist in the earth’s core and have magnetic and conductive properties that make them crucial to the production of electronics, clean energy technologies and some weapon systems.
Ukraine doesn’t have globally significant reserves of rare earth minerals, but it does have some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals. Some of these reserves are in areas that are currently under Russian occupation.
China has long dominated the global production of rare earth minerals and other strategically important materials. It is responsible for nearly 90% of global processing of rare earth minerals, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). On top of that, China is also the world’s largest producer of graphite and titanium, and a major processor of lithium.
The latest trade spat between Washington and Beijing makes it even more important for the US to look for alternative suppliers.
The economic measures China announced on Tuesday in retaliation for Trump’s new tariffs include new export controls on more than two dozen metal products and related technologies. While they do not cover the most critical materials the US needs, the move indicates that China is prepared to use its mineral riches as leverage in trade disputes.
Mycyk said that the demand for these critical materials is expected to surge because of the global transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies.
“Ukraine’s deposits are thus globally significant, offering diversification away from dominant producers like China. Keeping these resources under Ukrainian control is crucial for maintaining its economic sovereignty,” he added.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

Armen Sarkisyan died Monday at a Moscow hospital from injuries sustained in an explosion in an upmarket residential complex in the capital city, TASS quoted the medical services as saying. The Russian Investigative Committee later confirmed Sarkisyan’s death, stating that “despite the assistance provided, one of the victims died in a medical facility.”
Sarkisyan, also known by nickname “Armen Gorlovsky” after Horlivka (Gorlovka in Russian) the eastern Ukrainian town he is from, founded the separatist Arbat Battalion fighting in the region. Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence described him as a “well-known criminal mastermind” who became the “supervisor” of prisons across Russia and occupied territories of Ukraine in November 2022.
The Ukrainian Defense Intelligence said the founding of Arbat in 2022 was an attempt to counterbalance the influence of Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in the Russian private military company sector. Prigozhin was killed the following year when his plane crashed two months after his attempted mutiny against Russia’s leadership.
The battalion fought in several key battles of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) previously said. Arbat was composed “almost entirely” of former Wagner personnel, the US-based conflict monitor said in October 2023.
Sarkisyan was an ally of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-leaning leader who was ousted following deadly protests in Ukraine in 2014 and fled to Russia, according to Ukrainian authorities. Sarkisyan was wanted in Ukraine for his alleged role in the violent response to those demonstrations against Yanukovych.
Sarkisyan was leaving the exclusive Aliye Parusa residential complex in northwest Moscow on Monday morning when the explosion happened, a local resident said in a video published by the independent Russian media outlet SOTA.
Asked about the incident during a press briefing on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special services are doing their job. It is difficult work. The information is being clarified, and work is ongoing, so it is impossible for us to comment on anything at this time.”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Anna Chernova', 'Victoria Butenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/02/europe/serbia-protests-novi-sad-belgrade-vucic-intl/index.html,How a train station tragedy is threatening to bring down a hardline European president,2025-02-02 05:00:47,"On the first day of November, Aleksandar Matkovic was running late for a train. He was traveling from Novi Sad, in the north of Serbia, to its capital Belgrade, where he works as an economic historian. When he got to the station, he witnessed a scene of horror that has rocked the country to this day.
Minutes before he arrived, the canopy of the station – where reconstruction had been completed months earlier – had collapsed, crushing passengers waiting on the platform. Fifteen people were killed.
“I stood there for about two or three hours, just staring blankly at the space where the canopy was. The whole thing was so unrealistic,” Matkovic told CNN.
Shock soon turned to anger. The crumbled canopy has come to serve as a potent symbol of what many Serbs see as corruption at the heart of the state, sculpted by President Aleksandar Vucic and his government over 12 years in power. What began as vigils for the dead have become near-daily protests, drawing in ever-larger segments of Serbian society and reaching every corner of the Balkan nation. “We’re in uncharted territory,” said Matkovic.
The student-led demonstrations, demanding the full release of documents about the reconstruction works, have become so large and so lasting that some have questioned whether they could bring down Vucic’s reign. “All sorts of questions are going through people’s minds,” said Matkovic.
Vucic has dominated Serbia since coming to power as prime minister in 2014, then president three years later. A former information minister for the brutal Yugoslav regime of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian democracy has degraded under Vucic’s Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Freedom House, which measures the strength of democracies, said Serbia declined from “free” to “partly free” in 2019, citing attacks on the media and concentration of power in the hands of the president.
His regime is hard to categorize, analysts say. It is not as repressive as Aleksander Lukashenko’s Belarus, but neither as permissive as Viktor Orban’s Hungary. Ivana Stradner, a fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said Vucic has “made Serbia what Russia was like in the early 1990s, leaning towards a criminal, corrupt state with no rule of law.”
Still, his detractors praise him as a canny operator. In an increasingly multipolar world, countries such as Serbia – a regional powerhouse that the West has tried to prize away from its historic ally Russia – enjoy plenty of options. For Moscow, Serbia can stem the westward slide of other Balkan nations. For Europe, a huge proposed lithium mine could make it important for the green transition. For China, Serbia offers the chance to extend its influence through the Belt and Road Initiative.
Even some in the United States have interests in the country. Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, is reportedly working on a deal to build a Trump-branded hotel in Belgrade, with capital from various Gulf states.
For Serbia, this transactional approach may not add up to a coherent ideology – it has sold weapons to Ukraine but refuses to join sanctions against Russia – but it has been profitable. Serbia has been kept plied with Russian gas, Chinese infrastructure, European investment, and even glitzy American construction projects.
Turning point
This “strategic ambiguity,” as Stradner calls it, has come at the cost of domestic discontent, however.
“People have had enough,” said Engjellushe Morina, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The students are fed up with this rhetoric … where Vucic says one thing for internal consumption and another thing for international consumption.”
Anger with the government had been brewing for years. In May 2023, when Serbia was rocked by two mass shootings, people protested the country’s “culture of violence.” There were more demonstrations after a disputed election later that year, with the opposition calling for a rerun. They also lasted for weeks but eventually fizzled out.
This time is different, protesters and analysts say. Latent discontent with the government found its expression in the Novi Sad station tragedy. The station had been hastily reopened in 2022 – with Vucic and Orban in attendance – ahead of an election held that year, before being closed for more works by a Chinese company and its subcontractors. Matkovic said Serbs felt the project was “fast tracked” and “pushed by political elites.” It reopened in July 2024, just four months before its newly built canopy collapsed.
While previous scandals have failed to stick to Vucic, this one has. The perception of alleged corruption is “one thing that unifies all people,” said Stradner.
Serbian prosecutors have so far indicted 13 people for their role in the disaster, including the former minister for construction, transport and infrastructure, but protesters have demanded that more be done to hold people politically and criminally accountable.
‘The fear factor is gone’
Analysts say Vucic is skilled in thwarting protests by making targeted concessions, jettisoning allies, catching the opposition off-guard or ridiculing the movement. He regularly labels protesters as “foreign agents” attempting to stage a “color revolution,” as in other former Soviet states.
But these demonstrations represent a new challenge. Because they began as acts of mourning, they were largely free of “political” signs such as European Union flags, which Vucic has previously used to discredit demonstrations.
The protests have also drawn in broad swaths of Serbian society. In scenes reminiscent of the end of Milosevic’s regime, farmers have joined in, driving their tractors into Belgrade.
Even judges have come on board – a shock, given Vucic’s control of much of the judiciary, said Edward P. Joseph, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University who served for a dozen years in the Balkans, including with NATO.
“Ordinarily they would never dare to raise their head in such public fashion, but now they’re showing themselves in silent support of the protests,” Joseph told CNN. “The fear factor is gone.”
It is not clear how Vucic can reclaim that power, Joseph said. Because Vucic must “play this charade” of responsibility, a violent crackdown would be “writing his own epitaph.”
But the opposite approach – embarking on large-scale democratic reforms – is also challenging, said Morina. Although Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned this week, saying he did so “in order not to further raise tensions in society,” this has done little to satisfy the protesters.
“How convincing is it that he (Vucic) is going to be able to turn this whole movement that he has built – the SNS (the Serbian Progressive Party), the party supporters, the radicals, the football hooligans – how can he turn this into a democratic movement?” Morina said.
It is not clear what can break the deadlock. The protest movement has distanced itself from opposition politicians, meaning there is no obvious alternative waiting in the wings. But this could be a strength, Stradner said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/world/trump-ukraine-minerals-military-aid-intl/index.html,Ukraine’s mineral riches have long been eyed by its allies. Now they may be Trump’s price for military aid,2025-02-04 16:54:22,"US President Donald Trump has said he wants access to Ukraine’s mineral deposits in exchange for future military aid that Kyiv needs as it continues to defend itself against Russia’s aggression.
While the comment highlighted Trump’s transactional approach to the war in Ukraine, it was not entirely unexpected. The US and other Western countries have eyed Ukraine’s mineral riches for a long time.
“We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do (that),” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, without specifying what, if anything, Ukraine had agreed to do.
He has previously suggested that any future assistance should be provided as a loan and would be conditioned on Ukraine negotiating with Russia.
Under former US President Joe Biden, the US had provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.
Biden argued the aid was necessary because Ukraine’s victory was key to America’s own security. Trump, however, has made it clear he doesn’t believe the US should continue providing assistance without getting something in return.
While Trump did not give any details on what he wants from Kyiv, a deal outlining a deeper cooperation between the US and Ukraine on minerals had been in the works for months before he took office in January.
A memorandum of understanding prepared under the Biden administration last year said the US would promote investment opportunities in Ukraine’s mining projects to American companies in exchange for Kyiv creating economic incentives and implementing good business and environmental practices.
Ukraine already has a similar agreement with the European Union, signed in 2021.
Adam Mycyk, a partner in the Kyiv office of the global law firm Dentons, said that while the objective of the deal – securing critical mineral supplies from Ukraine – remains unchanged, Trump’s approach seems to be more transactional.
“It remains to be seen what form such an agreement could take, but it would be in Ukraine’s best interests for its post-war recovery and long-term economic prospects to maximize as much as possible the processing and value creation of any extracted minerals in Ukraine by Ukrainian companies,” Mycyk told CNN.
Kyiv has not yet responded to Trump’s comments, but the Ukrainian government has in the past made the argument that its mineral deposits are one of the reasons the West should support Ukraine – to prevent these strategically important resources from falling into Russian hands.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has specifically mentioned the possibility of future investments in the country’s natural resources by its Western allies as a key part of his “Victory plan.”
“The deposits of critical resources in Ukraine, along with Ukraine’s globally important energy and food production potential, are among the key predatory objectives of the Russian Federation in this war. And this is our opportunity for growth,” Zelensky said in a statement outlining the plan in October.
Nataliya Katser-Buchkovska, the co-founder of the Ukrainian Sustainable Investment Fund, said a deal that would bring US investment into Ukraine’s mining sector would be beneficial for both sides.
The US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs, many of which come from China. Of the 50 minerals classed as critical, the US was entirely dependent on imports of 12 and more than 50% dependent on imports of a further 16, according to the United States Geological Survey, a government agency.
Ukraine, meanwhile, has deposits of 22 of these 50 critical materials, according to the Ukrainian government.
“It is not only a crucial step for Ukraine’s post-war economic recovery, but it’s also a chance for the US to address global supply chain issues,” said Katser-Buchkovska, who served as a member of the Ukrainian Parliament from 2014 to 2019 and was the head of a parliamentary committee on energy security and transition.
China’s global dominance
Although Trump used the term “rare earths,” it is unclear whether he intended to refer specifically to rare earth minerals – a group of 17 elements that exist in the earth’s core and have magnetic and conductive properties that make them crucial to the production of electronics, clean energy technologies and some weapon systems.
Ukraine doesn’t have globally significant reserves of rare earth minerals, but it does have some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals. Some of these reserves are in areas that are currently under Russian occupation.
China has long dominated the global production of rare earth minerals and other strategically important materials. It is responsible for nearly 90% of global processing of rare earth minerals, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). On top of that, China is also the world’s largest producer of graphite and titanium, and a major processor of lithium.
The latest trade spat between Washington and Beijing makes it even more important for the US to look for alternative suppliers.
The economic measures China announced on Tuesday in retaliation for Trump’s new tariffs include new export controls on more than two dozen metal products and related technologies. While they do not cover the most critical materials the US needs, the move indicates that China is prepared to use its mineral riches as leverage in trade disputes.
Mycyk said that the demand for these critical materials is expected to surge because of the global transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies.
“Ukraine’s deposits are thus globally significant, offering diversification away from dominant producers like China. Keeping these resources under Ukrainian control is crucial for maintaining its economic sovereignty,” he added.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/europe/armen-sarkisyan-bomb-death-moscow-intl-latam/index.html,Founder of pro-Russian paramilitary group dies in explosion in Moscow,2025-02-03 18:42:12,"The founder of a pro-Russian militia group in eastern Ukraine, described by authorities in Kyiv as a “criminal mastermind”, has died following a bombing in central Moscow, according to Russian state media.
Armen Sarkisyan died Monday at a Moscow hospital from injuries sustained in an explosion in an upmarket residential complex in the capital city, TASS quoted the medical services as saying. The Russian Investigative Committee later confirmed Sarkisyan’s death, stating that “despite the assistance provided, one of the victims died in a medical facility.”
Sarkisyan, also known by nickname “Armen Gorlovsky” after Horlivka (Gorlovka in Russian) the eastern Ukrainian town he is from, founded the separatist Arbat Battalion fighting in the region. Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence described him as a “well-known criminal mastermind” who became the “supervisor” of prisons across Russia and occupied territories of Ukraine in November 2022.
The Ukrainian Defense Intelligence said the founding of Arbat in 2022 was an attempt to counterbalance the influence of Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in the Russian private military company sector. Prigozhin was killed the following year when his plane crashed two months after his attempted mutiny against Russia’s leadership.
The battalion fought in several key battles of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) previously said. Arbat was composed “almost entirely” of former Wagner personnel, the US-based conflict monitor said in October 2023.
Sarkisyan was an ally of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-leaning leader who was ousted following deadly protests in Ukraine in 2014 and fled to Russia, according to Ukrainian authorities. Sarkisyan was wanted in Ukraine for his alleged role in the violent response to those demonstrations against Yanukovych.
Sarkisyan was leaving the exclusive Aliye Parusa residential complex in northwest Moscow on Monday morning when the explosion happened, a local resident said in a video published by the independent Russian media outlet SOTA.
Asked about the incident during a press briefing on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special services are doing their job. It is difficult work. The information is being clarified, and work is ongoing, so it is impossible for us to comment on anything at this time.”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Anna Chernova', 'Victoria Butenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/02/europe/serbia-protests-novi-sad-belgrade-vucic-intl/index.html,How a train station tragedy is threatening to bring down a hardline European president,2025-02-02 05:00:47,"On the first day of November, Aleksandar Matkovic was running late for a train. He was traveling from Novi Sad, in the north of Serbia, to its capital Belgrade, where he works as an economic historian. When he got to the station, he witnessed a scene of horror that has rocked the country to this day.
Minutes before he arrived, the canopy of the station – where reconstruction had been completed months earlier – had collapsed, crushing passengers waiting on the platform. Fifteen people were killed.
“I stood there for about two or three hours, just staring blankly at the space where the canopy was. The whole thing was so unrealistic,” Matkovic told CNN.
Shock soon turned to anger. The crumbled canopy has come to serve as a potent symbol of what many Serbs see as corruption at the heart of the state, sculpted by President Aleksandar Vucic and his government over 12 years in power. What began as vigils for the dead have become near-daily protests, drawing in ever-larger segments of Serbian society and reaching every corner of the Balkan nation. “We’re in uncharted territory,” said Matkovic.
The student-led demonstrations, demanding the full release of documents about the reconstruction works, have become so large and so lasting that some have questioned whether they could bring down Vucic’s reign. “All sorts of questions are going through people’s minds,” said Matkovic.
Vucic has dominated Serbia since coming to power as prime minister in 2014, then president three years later. A former information minister for the brutal Yugoslav regime of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian democracy has degraded under Vucic’s Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Freedom House, which measures the strength of democracies, said Serbia declined from “free” to “partly free” in 2019, citing attacks on the media and concentration of power in the hands of the president.
His regime is hard to categorize, analysts say. It is not as repressive as Aleksander Lukashenko’s Belarus, but neither as permissive as Viktor Orban’s Hungary. Ivana Stradner, a fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said Vucic has “made Serbia what Russia was like in the early 1990s, leaning towards a criminal, corrupt state with no rule of law.”
Still, his detractors praise him as a canny operator. In an increasingly multipolar world, countries such as Serbia – a regional powerhouse that the West has tried to prize away from its historic ally Russia – enjoy plenty of options. For Moscow, Serbia can stem the westward slide of other Balkan nations. For Europe, a huge proposed lithium mine could make it important for the green transition. For China, Serbia offers the chance to extend its influence through the Belt and Road Initiative.
Even some in the United States have interests in the country. Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, is reportedly working on a deal to build a Trump-branded hotel in Belgrade, with capital from various Gulf states.
For Serbia, this transactional approach may not add up to a coherent ideology – it has sold weapons to Ukraine but refuses to join sanctions against Russia – but it has been profitable. Serbia has been kept plied with Russian gas, Chinese infrastructure, European investment, and even glitzy American construction projects.

This “strategic ambiguity,” as Stradner calls it, has come at the cost of domestic discontent, however.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia targeted the building in Poltava early Saturday morning, calling the attack “another terrorist crime.”
There has been no let up in the fighting in Ukraine, even with Donald Trump now in the White House having promised to reach a ceasefire quickly.
Ukraine’s army continues to be pushed back on the eastern frontlines in the face of superior Russian manpower and resources.
Among the victims of the strike in Poltava was Olena Yavorska, her husband Dmytro and their 9-year-old daughter Sofia, according to Olena’s colleague, who posted a statement on Facebook.
“Russia killed our colleague and her family,” Volodymyr Popereshniuk, co-owner of Nova Poshta, a Ukranian logistics company where Olena worked, said Sunday. “Olena was a biology teacher by education, but in 2015 she joined Nova Poshta. The Yavorsky family resided on the second floor of the destroyed building.”
Emergency services and psychologists from the country’s national police department are providing help to nearly 200 people, the state emergency service said Sunday. Rescue operations are ongoing, it added.
Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia traded blame over a deadly strike on a former boarding school on Saturday in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have been holding territory after launching a shock incursion last summer.
The Ukrainian military said the Russian air force struck the school in the town of Sudzha with a guided aerial bomb, killing at least four people as locals were sheltering in the building and preparing to evacuate. At least 84 more people were rescued and four are in “serious condition,” the Ukrainian military said, calling the attack a “war crime.”
At the same time, the Russian military blamed Ukraine for the attack on the boarding school, also calling it a “war crime.”
“The launch of enemy missiles from the [Ukrainian] Sumy region was detected by Russian air defense systems,” the Russian military said in a statement Sunday.
The statement went on to accuse Ukraine of using the “provocation” to distract global “public opinion from [Ukraine’s] atrocities” in a separate area of the Kursk region.
CNN cannot independently verify the claims by Ukraine and Russia.
The spat occurred as Ukraine’s air defenses shot down dozens of drones overnight as Russia carried out fresh attacks, the country’s air force said Sunday.
In total, the air force said it downed 40 out of the 55 drones launched in areas across the country, including the capital Kyiv, but added that Kharkiv and Sumy regions were impacted by the “enemy attack.”","['Kareem El Damanhoury', 'Billy Stockwell', 'Mariya Knight']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/02/europe/ukraine-russia-frontline-ceasefire-deal-intl/index.html,‘There is no future’: Even a potential ceasefire sparks little hope in eastern Ukraine,2025-02-02 05:00:47,"Could a ceasefire deal be a disaster for Ukraine in disguise?
That is the urgent question echoing in Ukrainian frontline bunkers and in the ruins of besieged towns, where ubiquitous exhaustion begs for peace, but where a costly learned distrust of Russia rules.
Anxiety is manifold. Would a ceasefire hold? Would Russia just use it to re-equip and attack again? Would Moscow even want it, given it is fast winning ground? Would Ukraine’s allies give it the same military support, if they felt diplomacy had led the guns to fall silent?
The screens before Volodymyr Sablyn, a battalion commander in the 66th mechanized brigade, tell a gut-wrenching story of Ukraine’s modern, yet archaically brutal battlefield. Tiny, cheap drones fly over the pockmarked and battered trenches around Lyman – a mix of frozen sludge, trash, bunkers and “beetroot,” the ugly term for human remains that cannot be retrieved.
“If there is a ceasefire now, it will only get worse for us”, Sablyn told CNN this week. “Because the enemy will restore itself, form new military units, regroup and attack again.”
Sablyn joined the army in February 2015, when Russian separatists took the Donetsk town of Debaltseve despite agreeing to a truce. Now, across the eastern front, ceasefires called a decade ago that provided little but cover for further Russian military advances are living proof of the urgent need for caution at the negotiating table.
The scene Sablyn commands is one where relentless Russian assaults and tolerance of casualties has exploited Kyiv’s key weakness: a lack of infantry. As Sablyn’s forces drop mortars on Lyman’s frontlines, Moscow’s forces are advancing on a vital military hub to his south – Pokrovsk. The pace of its encirclement is startling and, once it falls, Russia will have few major settlements between its forces and the major cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.
Hope is a key currency here, and one facet of it, consistently raised by Ukrainian officials, is the idea of European or NATO troops providing security guarantees to Kyiv through their specific presence in frontline areas – as peacekeepers of sorts.
A European defense official told CNN recently there were “active discussions” about similar assistance. A ceasefire, followed by European NATO members manning a de-militarized zone is a key tenet of a peace plan floated by US President Donald Trump’s new Ukraine envoy, Gen. Keith Kellogg, in a policy paper from April.
“If NATO could send troops to Ukraine,” said Sablyn, “it would be a guarantee of security in Ukraine. Because Russia – no matter how much they say that they are not afraid of anyone – are afraid of America, are afraid of NATO as a whole.”
Yet as dusk settles near the 66th’s forward artillery units, the idea seems beset with insurmountable risk. The threat of Russian drones is so acute, artillery units can be reached when the sun tips into the horizon, and the light is vanishing.
A unit commander who escorts us checks his handheld monitor to see if the Russian surveillance drones have left. We pause for 10 minutes until the all-clear is given and then race across the rocky fields to a tree-line where aging artillery guns deal regular “suppressing fire” to the Russians.
Peace is something here you better be deadly serious about, and the men who live underground are skeptical about.
“There is only a 30% chance of a ceasefire,” said one soldier, Viktor. “Because the situation on the front is not in such a way that we can see that there will be a truce. It’s all very difficult.”
Another, Andriy, added: “I think it’s 40%. The other side is winning, taking territories. And we, by and large, have nothing to say.”
CNN is not including the full names of several people we spoke to, because of security concerns.
The growing candor of troops who would months ago repeat only studied assurances of victory is replicated by some exhausted civilians from frontline towns.
Slowly trudging through the ravaged streets of Lyman is Larysa, 72, her gold incisors bright among the shell-peppered concrete.
“We’ve been hit 19 times today… 19 times since this morning,” she told CNN. “My husband is counting, and I’m taking sleeping pills. And then he wakes me up and says: ‘Well, did you count?’”
She becomes tearful when asked why she has not left a town first taken in the Russian invasion of 2022, then liberated by Ukrainian forces later that year, and now heavily pressured by Putin’s men again, who are about 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) from its outskirts.
“Here, I ran barefoot; there, I swam in the river,” she said, gesturing to the town’s edges. I am 72, I don’t want to (leave). All my three brothers are buried here, all my aunts, uncles, dad, mum. I can’t leave.”
She has scant sympathy for Kyiv, describing the Ukrainian soldiers she meets in supermarkets as unkempt, and saying a friend’s family of seven left Lyman two weeks earlier and were housed in a stable in nearby Poltava. “A stable! But it was clean and there was some hay.”
Larysa said Trump will be no different to Biden, who she had heard on television tried to buy parts of eastern Ukraine for his son, likely echoing false Russian propaganda. Her hopes are with the Kremlin as the decision-makers.
“Nobody’s going to solve this. Only Putin will if he says, ‘that’s enough, I’ve already killed so many people.’” She nods when asked if peace through Putin is the only path ahead.
Behind her, a bus collects locals who still shuffle in and out of the desolate town to go shopping. None will talk except the driver, Dima, who says he went to Russia when the Russians first invaded to stay with relatives and recently came back. He says he is used to the destruction and hopeful for peace. “It’s all politics. Nothing depends on us. As it is decided, so it will be.”
For others, there has been a decade of turmoil and loss.
Inesa, 60, sits alone in the central square of Slovyansk, where 10 years ago Russian proxy separatists seized the local administration building and fought off the Ukrainian army, over repeated ceasefires, deals and Russian advances.
She said a decade earlier, despite the chaos of separatism, they still had jobs and hope. Now she and her mother are all that remains in Slovyansk, a key Russian target in Donetsk, the rest of her family scattered, she said, across the world by war.
“Now there is no future,” she said. “We don’t see it. Who does? I want it just to stop. Stop the bombing.”","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Rebecca Wright', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/03/europe/ukraine-kyiv-pregnant-woman-twins-intl-cmd/index.html,‘It’s like a constant gamble:’ Ukrainian couple await birth of twins in wartime Kyiv,2023-01-03 05:14:23,"Kateryna and her husband Oleg endure what every citizen of Kyiv must – long blackouts, hours without any internet connection and constant apprehension about the next missile barrage.
But as they begin 2023, they are also preparing for the arrival of twin boys. Kateryna, who is 34, is eight months pregnant. CNN agreed to use only first names for her and Oleg as they fear for their privacy.
She’s not getting much rest ahead of the big day. The air-raid sirens blare almost every day, the crump of explosions is all too familiar. Their lives are shaped by the scheduled power cuts, as electricity is shared among the regions to mitigate the impact of Russia’s strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.
“On New Year’s Eve, I tried to take a nap,” she told CNN from her house in the Kyiv suburbs. “But I woke to the sound of explosions, and they went on through the night. The sirens were on for much of the night, until 4:30 a.m.,” she said.
It’s difficult for residents to distinguish between the sound of air defenses in operation and the impact of Russian cruise missiles and drones.
“I don’t mind the blackouts,” Kateryna said, “but we worry about the next wave of Russian missiles. Will it be us? It’s like a constant gamble.”
A nearby district – Vyshhorod – was hit a month ago, and the indiscriminate nature of the strikes means that residential districts are as much at risk as power plants and railway lines. Dozens of heath facilities across Ukraine, including maternity and children’s hospitals, have been struck since the beginning of the conflict.
When the sirens aren’t wailing, Kateryna said, there is another noise that is new to her neighborhood: the chattering of generators as homes and businesses try to compensate for being without electricity for as much as 12 hours a day.
“They are the jingle bells of this Christmas,” she said.
Despite the risk and the imminent arrival of the twins, Kateryna still travels into central Kyiv twice a week to use one of the co-working spaces that have popped up across the Ukrainian capital.
These spaces have become quite professional, with furniture, heat, lighting and reliable internet, provided through Starlink terminals, bought from the company owned by Elon Musk.
Kateryna works in logistics, helping to import large containers into Ukraine. It’s more than just a livelihood. It’s also a way to contribute to the war effort.
Kateryna and Oleg are luckier than most Ukrainians in that they have a small generator at home, but they use it sparingly. There is always the risk of running out of diesel to power it – it uses a liter of fuel every hour and needs to cool down every four hours. They have to choose which appliances to run: it’s lights or laundry, they said.
They fully expect to need it long after the twins are born.
Living in Kyiv during Russia’s war on Ukraine is about being prepared. Kateryna and Oleg have cupboards full of batteries, power banks and flashlights. If the Russian missile campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure continues, as most expect it will, the scheduled power outages may become less predictable, with more emergency cuts.
There is enough food in the stores “but sometimes I have to shop with a flashlight,” Kateryna says. They keep about two months’ worth of food supplies stacked in the house, just in case the situation goes from bad to worse.
Like many people from Kyiv, Kateryna and Oleg moved away from the capital to a safer area in western Ukraine when the invasion began last February. But they never wanted to leave the country. And soon they felt the draw of home pulling them back to the city.
“I have a job here; Oleg has a job here and he cannot work remotely. We have many friends here, our home. For me it’s a nightmare to move somewhere else,” Kateryna said.
Kateryna feels they are both involved in the effort to secure Ukraine’s future. In the early months of her pregnancy, she helped Ukrainian volunteer organizations with fundraising for warm clothes and equipment for the Ukrainian army, she said.
“The company my husband works for has a fund and they help the Ukrainian fighters who are on the front line with equipment like drones and pick-up trucks. We helped collect money for such equipment,” she said.
Like many other Ukrainians, they helped a family that had fled the frontlines earlier in the war. The mother had given birth in the midst of Russian shelling of their hometown of Kreminna in eastern Luhansk region. When the family settled in a Kyiv suburb, Oleg and Kateryna helped them out with warm clothes and food.
Kateryna says she is not afraid of becoming a wartime mother. She and Oleg want their sons to grow up in an environment that would be the polar opposite of what life would be under Russian occupation.
“I really want my children to live in a free Ukraine, I want them to be safe. They have the right to safety and protection just like all other children in the world. I don’t want them to live in fear of dying from a Russian rocket, they should be happy and carefree,” she said.
Her one concern – beyond giving birth to healthy children – is that she might find herself lying in the hospital amid another wave of missile attacks. At that point, she will pray very hard, she said.","['Mariya Knight', 'Tim Lister']",en

“The presence of DPRK troops has not been observed for about three weeks, and they were probably forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses,” a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military’s Special Operations Forces, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told CNN.
It follows reports that some North Korean units have been pulled back from the frontlines after significant losses, according to Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.
About 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been sent to Russia, according to Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports, which say around 4,000 those troops have been killed or injured.
North Korean troops have been deployed to Kursk since at least November to repel Ukraine’s incursion in the southern Russian border region.
“We are still in the Kursk region… the Russian forces were not enough to push us out,” Ukrainian President Zelensky said last week at a speech in Davos, Switzerland. Zelensky noted that there were 60,000 Russian troops in Kursk and 12,000 North Koreans.
Zelensky also said that one-third of those North Korean troops had been killed.
CNN has previously reported on the brutal and near-suicidal tactics of North Korean soldiers, who in some cases have detonated grenades rather than be captured by Ukrainian forces and have written pledges of allegiance on the battlefield to North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.
A commander with the 6th Special Operations Forces regiment, who did not want to give his name for security reasons, told CNN that while the North Korean soldiers are “all young, trained, hardy fighters,” they would have not previously faced drones in combat. “They are prepared for the realities of war in 1980 at best,” he said.
Another battalion serviceman told CNN the North Koreans had shown good marksmanship when shooting down drones from about a 100-meter distance, suggesting a high level of training in North Korea.
However, Russia appears to be using the troops as foot soldiers, using them to carry out mass ground assaults despite major losses in Kursk.
Ukraine has recently made advancements in Kursk, according to a battlefield update from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a DC-based think-tank, on January 26. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said earlier this week that Russian forces recaptured the Kursk region village of Nikolayevo-Daryino, which lies on the Russia-Ukraine border.
Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have officially acknowledged the presence of North Korean troops in Russia.
Last year, months before the deployment of North Koreans to Russia, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin signed a landmark defense pact and pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
The pact is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and has been viewed as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/europe/american-fighters-ukraine-bodies-repatriation-intl-cmd/index.html,American fighters are dying in Ukraine in growing numbers. Bringing their bodies home is a complex task,2025-01-30 05:00:47,"Editor’s Note: This report contains details of death and injury that some may find distressing.
More than 20 Americans are missing in action on the front lines in Ukraine, with a spike in casualties over the past six months as foreigners fill urgent gaps in the country’s embattled defenses, according to a CNN investigation.
The bodies of at least five American volunteers who signed up to the Ukrainian military could not be retrieved from the battlefield after being killed in action in the past six months, CNN found. Two of these were repatriated from Russian-occupied territory on Friday to Ukrainian soil after lengthy negotiations.
The stark testimony of their surviving colleagues, and the growing toll, portrays the obscure yet important role of American frontline fighters in a war President Donald Trump has called “ridiculous” and has pushed Russian President Vladimir Putin to end diplomatically.
The relatives of the missing Americans have told CNN of the distressing lack of closure in not being able to bury their sons, of the legal limbo of not being able to officially declare their loved ones dead, and also of the torment inflicted by Russian internet trolls who harass them online. The intensity of fighting across Ukraine’s front eastern lines means the corpses of soldiers from both sides often cannot be collected and litter the battlefield.
Two American volunteers were killed in a single incident just outside Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine in late September, according to survivors and relatives. Neither’s body has been recovered. Former US soldier Zachary Ford, 25, from Missouri, and another American without military experience, whose family requested to be identified only by his callsign ‘Gunther,’ were killed by a drone while tasked with blowing up a bridge near the village of Novohrodivka.
The surviving American, who asked to be known by his callsign ‘Redneck,’ described a mission with a limited chance of success, where the group of three US volunteers were swiftly trapped by Russian fire in a trench about 500 meters from their bridge target.
“Russian drones start coming down the treeline, to try to crash through the roof of the bunker,” he recalled in an interview with CNN last week from the United States. A log in the roof fell and hit him in the face, he said. “I had the shotgun, I was trying to shoot these things down.”
Ford told his commanders on the radio they would abort the mission but was instructed to continue and that no evacuation was possible for another day, Redneck said. As the assault began, Redneck said he fired his machine gun at Russians directly in front of him, and that Ukrainians manning a grenade launcher and anti-tank Javelin weapon system died while holding back Russian armor.
He said he stepped into a bunker to get ammunition, narrowly missing the drone strike that wounded Ford and Gunther. Ford’s injuries required two tourniquets to stem the bleeding, Redneck said, which he applied before rejoining the defense and seeing a Ukrainian soldier fatally shot in the face in front of him.
Minutes later, he heard Ford yell, “Gunther is dead,” he told CNN. “I came down to check, and the Ukrainian that was in there, and just looked at me and said, ‘friend dead.’” Redneck said Ford remained stable, and their commander warned on the radio that another Russian attack was imminent.
“He knew we weren’t going to make it through another attack,” said Redneck of Ford, “so he started asking me to kill him so he wouldn’t be captured.” Redneck said he refused and told Ford they would find a way through this, before continuing to reload their weapons ahead of the anticipated assault.
“He went really quiet,” said Redneck of Ford. “A couple minutes later, (he) called me over and said he had loosened his tourniquets.” Redneck said he reapplied them, but Ford had lost too much blood.
Redneck said Ford’s last request was to see the sunlight as he died. “I laid him down with his head towards the door, so he could look out, see the sun, and I just held his hand. The last really intelligible thing he said was, ‘never let it be said that the bastards killed me.’”
Redneck said Ford had expressed a sentiment common among foreign fighters.
His most vivid memory of Ford was the tiny blue speaker he carried with him, on which he would constantly play the UK artist Artemas’ song, “I like the way you kiss me.” “He always was playing music and dancing around that speaker,” he said.
He said the likelihood of foreign volunteer fighters surviving on the front line depended on their level of experience but also on the tasks given by the brigades they joined. While some officers gave foreigners and Ukrainians equal tasks, he said, others “will sell you out and get you killed just as quick.”
“At this point, you cannot say it’s not America’s fight,” he said. Critics of the war are “trying to say, ‘well, this is Ukraine’s problem. If we can just make peace now, we won’t have to deal with this.’ The truth is, it’s not going to stop,” Redneck added.
He blamed the losses in his brigade on a “bad officer… who didn’t really see a difference between anyone. It was meat for the grinder, and he just sent whoever he could get.”
Redneck, speaking from the United States, said his unit was evacuated from the area and he later saw drone footage of Ford and Gunther’s bodies. The area where they fought is now under Russian control.
The process of retrieving the dead from the front lines is arduous and emotional. Former US Marine Corey Nawrocki, 41, from Pennsylvania, died fighting in Russia’s Bryansk region in October.
His body was paraded by Russian soldiers on Telegram, but after complex negotiations was one of nearly 800 dead returned to Ukraine by Russia on Friday, as was that of another missing American.
His mother, Sandy Nawrocki, wept as she described feeling a “whirlwind of emotions – relief, but sadness. A weight is lifted off my shoulder because now I don’t have to worry about what they might be doing to him over there.”
She described Nawrocki, a marine veteran of two decades with six tours in Iraq and two in Afghanistan, as a “smartass” who loved to make her laugh and was driven to fight in Ukraine because of the toll he had seen on civilians.
“Innocent people getting killed, babies being slaughtered,” she said. “I think that really bothered him.”
Nawrocki died after being shot while trying to help an injured colleague, his mother said she was told.
Images of his body and weapons were widely shared on Russian social media and she says her address and video of her home, were also posted. When she tried to notify Nawrocki’s Marine friends on social media of his death, pro-Russian trolls “would post all these nasty comments and, smiley faces,” she said.
She did not want her son to go to Ukraine but this “was an unprovoked war,” she said. “This is everyone’s war. If Russia wins, wins over Ukraine, that affects Poland, that affects all the European countries.”
The repatriation of dead Americans is the culmination of a complex and emotional path for those involved. Lauren Guillaume, an American living in Kyiv and working for the non-profit RT Weatherman Foundation, assists foreign families in finding their loved ones, often by trawling through morgues with the foundation’s Ukrainian investigator, Iryna Khoroshayeva.
Positive identification is possible through a combination of visual identification methods and DNA testing, Guillaume said.
Ukrainian officials said the task of identifying the dead is more complex when remains are returned from the Russian side. “After a body swap, we may be given a bag with 10 body remains belonging to different people,” said Artur Dobroserdov, Ukraine’s commissioner for missing persons under the Ministry of the Interior.
Dobroserdov confirmed that more than 20 Americans were missing in action, and said they could only release any part of the remains for repatriation once they had identified all of them, as they did not want families to bury part of a loved one only to be later given more remains.
One of the first cases in which Guillaume was able to assist was that of US Army veteran Cedric Hamm, from Texas, who was killed in the northern border region of Sumy in March. Hamm’s family were able to identify the unique mixture of Aztec and US military tattoos on his body in a video livestream Guillaume set up from the morgue. The body was then repatriated to San Antonio in December.
“I’m very proud of my son,” said his mother, Raquel Hamm, who said he had fought in Ukraine as he was keen to use his military past to travel. “His composure, even to the very end” had struck her, she said, describing how she was told “he saved another young man” during the gunfight that killed him.
“My expectation, honestly, was that my son was never going to be found,” said Hamm. “My son paid the ultimate price on the battlefield for Ukrainian freedom and that’s forever going to live with me. My child did not die in vain.”
“He was very selfless,” said a fellow American fighter injured in the battle that killed Cedric Hamm, speaking to CNN from the US where he is recovering. He asked to be referred to by a pseudonym, Mitchell, for security reasons.
Guillaume said foreigners can be declared dead through physical confirmation, like DNA testing on their remains, or through a court ruling, if there is significant evidence of their death. “It takes time,” she said. In March, her organization had a caseload of 16. It is now dealing with 88 dead or missing foreigners across 18 nationalities – half of them Americans. “Most of that is missing in action cases,” she said.
The true death toll among American volunteers in Ukraine remains unclear, Guillaume said.
She believes the rising number of dead and missing is down to foreigners being sent to tough, frontline areas where their prior military experience is needed. “We find that foreign operators do fill the gaps of very difficult, high-risk, high-reward operations. Their lives and their sacrifice are not wasted.”","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'Rebecca Wright', 'Victoria Butenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/politics/patriot-missiles-ukraine-israel-us/index.html,"Patriot missiles from Israel sent to Ukraine through US, official says",2024-06-14 00:00:00,"About 90 Patriot missiles from Israel are being sent to Ukraine in a transfer facilitated by the United States, according to a US defense official.
The missiles had been in storage in Israel, which operated Patriot air defense systems for more than 30 years before retiring them in April. Discussions about transferring the missiles from Israel to Ukraine have been ongoing since last summer, when Biden administration officials were hopeful the effort might allow the unused missiles to be sent to Kyiv to aid in its war with Russia.
Ukraine was desperate for more Patriot missiles as Russia launched barrages of missiles and drones, repeatedly overwhelming the country’s air defense systems.
But Israeli assistance to Ukraine has been very limited, and Israel’s leaders have been careful not to overly criticize Russia. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to walk a fine line with Russian President Vladimir Putin, making it difficult to finalize the transfer of missiles.
The Israeli Patriot missiles were first handed over to the United States before being shipped to Ukraine.
Axios was first to report the transfer.
In April, the Israel Defense Forces said it would retire its Patriot systems, which became fully integrated into the military in 1991. The first Israeli Patriot intercept came during the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, when the system shot down a drone launched from Gaza.
But the Patriot missiles are not Israel’s primary air defense system. To date, the IDF said Israeli Patriot batteries have carried out 19 interceptions, including nine during the current war against Hamas. Israel relies far more on its short-range Iron Dome aerial defense system, as well as its medium-range David’s Sling and long-range Arrow missiles.",['Oren Liebermann'],en

Using a fellow soldier to lure out attack drones. Removing body armor plates and helmets to enable faster attacks on foot. Writing pledges of allegiance to North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.
These are the brutal and near-suicidal tactics of North Korean soldiers, who have, since November, been deployed to repel Ukraine’s incursion in the southern Russian border region of Kursk.
Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been sent to Russia, according to Western intelligence reports, which say around 4,000 troops have been killed or injured.
Ahead of a likely escalation before any peace talks, Moscow is experiencing manpower shortages and Pyongyang is expected to send reinforcements, according to Ukrainian defense intelligence.
CNN has gained a rare insight into the world of North Korean troops fighting for Russia in interviews with Ukrainian special operations forces who told CNN the North Koreans they faced in intense fighting did not surrender.
In one video, shared with CNN, a Ukrainian soldier approaches an injured North Korean soldier who was lying face down, during clashes. As the Ukrainian pulls the North Korean soldier’s leg to see if he is still alive, the North Korean lets out a scream in Korean before detonating a grenade next to his head.
The Ukrainians swiftly open fire and dive back. South Korean lawmakers were told by the country’s intelligence service, who have provided assistance to Kyiv, that the soldier in the video’s last words were: “General Kim Jong Un.”
“They use grenades, which means they can blow themselves up,” said Pokémon, the call sign of a commander with the 6th Special Operations Forces, who like the other Ukrainian soldiers CNN spoke to, did not want to give his name for security reasons.
“They can just brazenly go into battle until they are neutralized,” Pokémon said, adding: “Despite all attempts to call them to surrender, they will continue to fight.”
He added that the North Koreans were unprepared for Ukraine’s battlefield realities, where modern drone combat and archaic trench warfare have led to significant casualties.
While the North Korean soldiers are “all young, trained, hardy fighters,”Pokémon said, they would have not previously faced a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) – which have transformed the war in Ukraine – in combat. “They are prepared for the realities of war in 1980 at best,” he said.
The Ukrainians CNN spoke with said the North Koreans persisted in frontal, mass assaults, often hitting the same place repeatedly, despite major losses.
Amur, a company commander, said some North Koreans removed their helmets and the heavy protective plates from their body armour, to make them lighter on their feet and enable a faster assault at Ukrainian positions.
“They’re very maneuverable and they run and move very quickly,” he said. “They’re hard to catch, especially with a drone,” Amur added, explaining that they often weave an indirect path towards Ukrainian defenses, as if trained to not run in a straight line.
The North Koreans also leave anti-tank mines on roads as they go, Amur said. “Every shelter, every car they just destroy with anti-tank grenade launchers. They move very fast, (they) literally run,” he said.
Amur showed CNN military equipment obtained from a fallen North Korean soldier, including a new issue rucksack that Amur said contained the bare minimum for survival but was laden with ammunition.
“In their backpacks is the minimum of water, small bottles - up to a liter,” Amur said. “There are no additional warm clothes - no hats, no scarves, nothing.”
Amur said the North Koreans appear to have the more modern versions of Russian standard issue equipment, with most in possession of around 10 magazines, 5-10 grenades, machine gun ammunition and mines. The North Korean soldier was carrying an AK-12 assault rifle – the newer model of the standard issue AK-47, Amur said.
Notes, fake military ID found
Earlier this month, Ukraine captured two North Korean soldiers, and released video of the injured men, speaking Korean and receiving treatment, as evidence of Pyongyang’s robust military support for Moscow.
Ukrainian special operations forces shared footage with CNN of the moment one of the soldiers was captured. The video shows a visibly injured North Korean soldier, wincing in pain, being carried by Ukrainian soldiers through their razor-wire defenses and land mines to safety.
Russian shelling escalated as the soldier was captured, Ukrainian officials said, aimed at stopping the North Korean soldier from being taken alive.
Ukrainian troops have taken DNA samples – saliva swabs and locks of hair – from the dead, which they said showed them to be of East Asian extraction, and provided further evidence of North Korean involvement.
The North Korean soldier seen detonating the grenade in the video carried a fake Russian military ID which identified him as 29-year-old Ment Chat. The document said he joined the Russian army in October and was from the Russian border region of Tuva, near Mongolia.
CNN saw several other notes and papers that Ukrainian soldiers found on the bodies of other North Korean soldiers.
One sheet of paper is peppered with pledges of allegiance to North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un and of victory in battle. It is unclear if the notes were meant to emphasize the soldier’s loyalty if killed in battle to protect their surviving families, or if it truly reflects their mindset.
Another note retrieved from the bodies extols North Korea’s prowess in combat and derides their enemy, Ukraine.
“The hammer of death to the unknown and the puppet trash is not far off. We wield the powerful force that makes them tremble in fear. An invincible and certain-to-win battle.”
Another note, from the collection said: “I will demonstrate unparalleled bravery to its fullest. World, watch closely.”
Acts of ‘disloyalty’ recorded
Ukrainian officials who reviewed the papers said the North Korean units consider their involvement in Russia’s war as an opportunity to gain battle experience to assist their leader in any future conflict nearer home.
While North Korea is one of the most militarized societies on earth - with an estimated 1.2 million armed service personnel and mandatory military service from age 17 - its troops have had very limited exposure to the battlefield since the Korean War, where an armistice brought hostilities to a halt in 1953.
Another document, likely written by an officer, recorded acts of disloyalty by North Korean subordinates - a common practice in the totalitarian state, where citizens are encouraged to inform on each other.
One note said a soldier had “engaged in an unimaginably disgraceful act by stealing supplies.” Another note said a different soldier had “failed to uphold the Supreme Commander’s dignity and placed his personal interests above all.”
Other papers contained the radio codes of the North Korean force, but also contained notes on new tactics to counter drone attacks, from which Amur said North Koreans had suffered major losses.
“My unit could take out about 30 enemy soldiers in a day’s work, just by throwing grenades on their heads. They didn’t understand what to do,” he said.
Labelled “How to destroy drones,” the handwritten North Korean note suggested using soldiers as bait.
“When a drone is spotted… at a distance of about 10-12 meters, one out of three people should unconditionally lure it, and the other two should take aim and shoot.
“Another method is, since shells will not fall again in the same crater, take cover in the crater…” it read.
A battalion commander, call sign Bandit, told CNN the North Koreans had shown good marksmanship when shooting down drones from about a hundred-meter distance, suggesting a high level of training in North Korea. “It’s one person who takes the hit. Two or three people stand on the side and shoot directly.”
Amur described a ruthless opponent. “They don’t take our prisoners. All of our servicemen we found are shot in the back of the head.”","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Rebecca Wright', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Brice Laine']",en

She should know. Since the brutal regime response in 2020, Tsikhanouskaya has lived in exile with her two children. Human rights activists say Belarus is holding more than 1,200 political prisoners, including Tsikhanouskaya’s husband, Sergei, whom she has been unable to contact for nearly two years.
Tsikhanouskaya only ran in 2020 after her husband was jailed and prevented from running. Perhaps underestimating the political novice, Lukashenko allowed Tsikhanouskaya to run against him – an oversight that led to the greatest threat he faced in his decades-long rule.
“He was complacent and completely misjudged the public mood,” Nigel Gould-Davies, the United Kingdom’s former ambassador to Belarus, told CNN. “That’s why he’s taking no chances at all this time.”
Now, Lukashenko is facing only token challengers, one of whom has said he is running “not instead of, but alongside the president.” For the first time, no independent observers monitored the vote and polling stations abroad were not be open, depriving some 3.5 million citizens outside the country of their vote.
While not calling for large-scale demonstrations, Tsikhanouskaya urged Belarusians to voice their dissent at the ballot box.
“We’re asking those forced to take part in this sham election to vote against all candidates,” she wrote on Telegram.
Tsikhanouskaya’s opposition movement has said the “elections” are merely “a meticulously orchestrated charade designed to perpetuate the illegitimate dictator’s grip on power.” The European Parliament and US State Department have also labelled the election a “sham.”
“Repression is born of weakness, not strength. The unprecedented measures to stifle any opposition make it clear that the Lukashenko regime fears its own people,” the State Department said last week.
After casting his ballot Sunday, Lukashenko told journalists he did not care whether the West recognizes Belarus’ election or not.
Lukashenko, a 70-year-old former Soviet collective farm boss, survived the scare in 2020 in part thanks to his longtime ally Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose support has become existential for the Belarusian regime.
After state media employees resigned in solidarity with the opposition, Putin sent Kremlin propagandists to replace them. Since then, Minsk’s dependence on Moscow has only deepened.
But Moscow has been exacting a price for its support. Russia used Belarus as a launch pad for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Lukashenko has since allowed Russia to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil. In December, Lukashenko said he was also preparing to receive Russia’s new ballistic missile, the “Oreshnik,” first used in a strike on Ukraine late last year.
Although Lukashenko is “more dependent on Russia and on Putin personally than ever before,” there may be limits to this alliance, said Gould-Davies, now a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank.
“Belarus has provided a wide range of valuable services to Russia, but the thing of course that it hasn’t done is send its own forces (to Ukraine),” he said, suggesting he may fear a backlash among his own troops or wider population if he did so.
“Ordinary Belarusians, emphatically, do not see this as their war, and they could not be persuaded that it is, no matter how much propaganda the Belarusian state were to pump out to them,” he said.
Since 2020, Lukashenko’s regime has stepped up its efforts to stamp out dissent. By the end of December 2024, Belarus was holding 1,265 political prisoners, according to Viasna, a human rights group.
Among them is Ales Bialiatski, the founder of Viasna who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, alongside human rights groups from Russia and Ukraine, for his documentation of rights abuses. The oldest prisoner is Mikhail Liapeika, 76, who was sent for compulsory psychiatric treatment after insulting Lukashenko.
Pavel Sapelka, a lawyer with Viasna, has said many detainees are held in conditions and subjected to treatment that amounts to “torture.”
Lukashenko will be 74 if he completes his seventh term in office. But he has given no indication that he intends to step down. “As long as I have health, I will stay with you,” he said during a visit to a church outside Minsk earlier this month.
Last week, Lukashenko mocked opposition leaders he said were waiting for him to “drop dead.”
“They say: ‘He is about to die, his voice is not the same, he has trouble speaking.’ Don’t hold your breath,” Lukashenko said.",['Christian Edwards'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/26/europe/putin-russia-economy-trump-analysis-intl/index.html,Putin lauds the strength of Russia’s economy. Others see a mirage,2025-01-26 05:01:57,"Since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia’s economy has surpassed expectations. Its figures are, if not rosy, not ruinous either. Last year, the war economy likely grew faster than the United States and all major European economies. Unemployment is at a record low. And if the ballooning defense budget has cramped other spending, that’s only temporary.
These statistics send a message to audiences at home and abroad, said Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. To the Russian public: “We’re still standing.” To Ukraine’s allies: “We can outlast you.”
Projecting an image of Russia’s economic strength has real-world consequences. Some in the West have questioned whether the sanctions imposed by Ukraine’s backers – and dismissed by President Vladimir Putin as mere “logistical hurdles” – work at all. If they don’t, why bother?
But other experts say this image of resilience is a mirage – one carefully curated by the Kremlin to make its adversaries think Russia’s economy is in good shape. As the war nears its third anniversary, this mask is starting to slip.
To explain Russia’s apparent economic might, analysts have turned to metaphor. Some have used the phrase “on steroids,” to describe growth that is rapid, but unnatural and unsustainable.
“‘Steroids’ is a good one, but it still produces some muscle. I wouldn’t call this muscle,” Ribakova told CNN. “It’s more like running around on cocaine.”
Russia may soon feel the pain after the party. Increasingly disgruntled Russian officials have warned that Russia’s economy is hitting the limits of what it can produce, driving up prices. Inflation accelerated last year despite the central bank hiking interest rates to 21% in October, a two-decade high.
While signing a flurry of executive orders on his first day back in the White House, US President Donald Trump said Russia’s economy was a sign that the country was in “big trouble,” and that Putin was “destroying Russia by not making a deal” on Ukraine.
Evidence of that trouble includes the impact of new sanctions, persistent labor shortages and signs of a credit bubble. Despite recent battlefield gains, analysts say Russia’s worsening economic problems could bring Putin to the negotiating table sooner than expected and may make sanctions relief a more powerful bargaining chip for the West.
Shadow budget
Throughout the war, the Kremlin has made extensive use of a strategy known as “reflexive control,” aimed at shaping an adversary’s perceptions in a way that leads the adversary – in this case, Ukraine’s Western backers – to choose actions that benefit Russia.
Weapons are a case in point. Every time the West has considered sending new technology to Ukraine – first, modern tanks, then fighter jets, then long-range weapons – the Kremlin has warned of dire consequences, potentially involving a nuclear strike. This has slowed the supply of weapons to Kyiv, benefiting Moscow.
The economy is no different. The Kremlin wants to convince Ukraine’s allies, particularly the United States, of Russia’s economic strength. If Russia can fund its war for years, the US might support a ceasefire that favors the Kremlin’s goals. Controlling perceptions is paramount, observers say.
And so, it helps to boast of Russia’s economic might. At his marathon annual press conference last month, Putin said Russia’s economy was growing “in spite of everything,” outstripping Europe and the US.
Economic growth and low unemployment have become Putin’s “trump cards,” Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote recently.
But these headline numbers conceal concerning trends. Russia is hiding the true cost of its war by using a shadow “off-budget financing scheme,” according to a new report by Craig Kennedy, an associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
While Russia’s “highly scrutinized” defense budget remains at sustainable levels, there has been a parallel and “largely overlooked” surge in corporate borrowing. These loans look private but really are disguised state spending, Kennedy wrote.
On February 25, 2022 – day 2 of the full-scale invasion – Russia enacted a law that empowers the state to force banks to lend to businesses providing goods and services for the war on terms set by the state, he noted.
Between the middle of that year and late 2024, Russia saw an “anomalous” 71% surge in private credit, by an amount equal to 19.4% of its gross domestic product, according to Kennedy. He estimates up to 60% of these loans (as much as $249 billion) have been made to war-related firms. “These are loans that the state has compelled banks to extend to largely uncreditworthy, war-related businesses on concessionary terms,” he wrote.
This means Russia is spending almost twice as much on the war as official figures indicate, Kennedy noted.
The funding scheme could lead to a far-reaching credit crisis, he warned, in large part by imposing heavy debt loads on war-related companies that are likely to default over time, which risks overwhelming banks with “a wave of toxic debt.”
Savers’ jitters
Kennedy’s analysis has provoked a range of responses. A Financial Times commentary said it showed Putin was sitting on a “ticking financial time bomb.”
Others are more temperate. Prokopenko and Alexander Kolyandr, a scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, have also disputed some of Kennedy’s findings, writing this month that fears of a banking crisis are “overblown.”
Tymofiy Mylovanov, head of the Kyiv School of Economics and Ukraine’s former economy minister, said the findings were concerning, but not necessarily destructive.
“The conditions for a crisis are there – but is the trigger?” he told CNN.
One such trigger could be panic among ordinary Russians, who know how it feels to have their savings wiped out. If they believe their deposits are at risk, this could spark bank runs.
Since the fall, rumors have swirled that the central bank could freeze customers’ deposits, which have ballooned as savers have rushed to profit from high interest rates. The Bank of Russia has called the idea “absurd.” But this has done little to reassure Russians, Mylovanov said.
“The fact that they are talking about it is a sign of trouble,” he said. “They cannot not talk about it.”
Meanwhile, the head of Russia’s New People party, Alexei Nechayev, has proposed a new law to prevent the central bank from freezing customers’ deposits without the Duma’s consent.
While the central bank tries to inspire confidence, some are voicing doubts about its governor, Elvira Nabiullina. Although she was credited with saving the economy at the war’s outset, some of Russia’s elite have since turned on her. The head of the state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec said the central bank’s high key interest rate was hampering exports, while the chair of oil giant Gazprom Neft said expensive credit could impact companies providing services to the oil industry, raising “serious concerns.”
Even Putin, a longtime supporter of Nabiullina, made a muted complaint during his year-end press conference, saying the central bank could have used instruments other than interest rate hikes and acted “more efficiently and at an earlier stage.”
Headwinds
Even without a credit crisis, Russia’s economy faces serious headwinds in 2025.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that Russian GDP grew 3.8% in 2024, but forecasts just 1.4% growth this year.
Putin recently conceded that “the amount of products has not grown as much as consumption has” – a classic recipe for price rises. Inflation accelerated to 9.5% last year, from 7.4% in 2023. Some supermarkets locked butter in cabinets to prevent thefts.
Although wages are up, this reflects problems in the labor market. Putin boasts of Russia’s record-low 2.3% unemployment rate, but this sword is double-edged. Low unemployment means higher wages, as Russian companies – short of 1.6 million skilled workers – must pay more to attract labor.
The war has played a part in the labor shortage: Ukraine’s top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Sunday that Russian forces had suffered more than 434,000 casualties last year – 150,000 of whom were killed in action. And since the start of the war, Russia has sustained more than 800,000 casualties, according to Ukraine’s military estimates. UK and US estimates are slightly lower than the Ukrainian count. CNN cannot independently verify the figures.
Russia could offset this by encouraging immigration, but Central Asian migrants – long used to plug gaps in the workforce – have faced rising xenophobia after recent terror attacks in Russia stoked ethnic tensions.
Most importantly, Western sanctions are beginning to inflict serious pain. A package announced by the Biden administration in its final days targeted Moscow’s “shadow fleet” – aging oil tankers used to dodge earlier sanctions on Russia’s oil exports. Dozens of these ships have dropped anchor around the world, unable to dock and unload due to the new measures. China and India – whose oil and gas purchases from Russia have helped fund its war – are reportedly looking for other suppliers.
Kyiv’s refusal to renew a gas transit agreement that allowed Russian gas to flow through Ukraine will cost Gazprom up to $5 billion a year in sales, Reuters has reported. The energy giant posted a loss of almost $7 billion in 2023 – its first in nearly 25 years – and is considering axing more than 1,500 jobs. Less money for Gazprom means less for Russia’s war chest.
The growing economic strain is causing Russia’s social contract to creak, said Prokopenko, the Carnegie fellow.
“The population no longer expects justice from the Kremlin; instead, they expect financial support,” she told CNN.
With this support “dwindling” – as war spending eats into budgets for other services – Prokopenko warned there was now “a clear divergence between the expectations of the population and the Kremlin’s capacity to deliver.”
Moscow cannot keep financing the war and the regular economy at the same time as maintaining broader economic stability, she said. Although the Kremlin has so far fudged all three, something may soon have to give.","['Christian Edwards', 'Anna Chernova']",en

Trump has long claimed that the war in Ukraine would not have happened under his watch, but Friday marked the first time Putin suggested the same thing – while also repeating Trump’s false claim that the 2020 US election was “stolen.”
“I can’t help but agree with (Trump) that if his victory had not been stolen in 2020, then maybe there would not have been the crisis in Ukraine that arose in 2022,” Putin told a Russian TV channel, presumably referring to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine which he himself had ordered in February 2022.
Trump has said in the past that he would end the war in Ukraine in one day, but then gave his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg 100 days to find a solution.
The new administration has so far not unveiled any concrete plan for how to achieve peace in Ukraine, but Trump said this week that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he wants to make a deal and suggested Putin should also want to find a solution.
“So, I think Russia should want to make a deal. Maybe they want to make a deal. I think from what I hear, Putin would like to see me. We’ll meet as soon as we can. I’d meet immediately. Every day we don’t meet soldiers are being killed in a battlefield,” Trump told reporters on Thursday.
Putin seemed amenable to meeting Trump, saying Russia was “always open to this.”
“As for the issue related to negotiations - we have always said, and I will emphasize this once again, that we are ready for negotiations on the Ukrainian issue,” the Russian leader told the Russian TV channel. A day earlier the Kremlin said it was waiting on “signals” from Washington.
The statement from Putin came a day after Trump made a threat of new sanctions against Moscow while addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos.
However, Putin questioned that warning on Friday, saying such a move would hurt the American economy. “He is not only a smart person, he is a pragmatic person, and I can hardly imagine that decisions will be made that will harm the American economy itself,” Putin said.
Responding to the comments later on Friday, Zelensky accused Putin of trying to “manipulate” Trump to achieve his goals.
The Ukrainian president said the issue of “Russia’s military potential and Putin’s readiness to continue the war and manipulate the leaders of the world” was discussed during Ukraine’s Supreme Commander in Chief Staff meeting on Friday.
“And in particular, he wants to manipulate the desire of the President of the United States of America to achieve peace. I am confident that no Russian manipulations will succeed anymore,” Zelensky said.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Anna Chernova', 'Katharina Krebs', 'Dariya Tarasova-Markina']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/europe/trumps-policy-ukrainian-war-unexpected-priority-intl/index.html,"Trump’s policy on Ukrainian war may lack focus, but it’s an unexpected priority",2025-01-24 15:02:04,"US President Donald Trump’s policy on Ukraine is a little scattered and meandering, and at times misinformed. But be in no doubt that it exists and seems an unanticipated priority.
Trump’s policy on Ukraine distinguishes itself in two ways in the first week of his administration.
The first is his persistent criticism of the economic damage the Kremlin head is doing to Russia. Trump is making a business case for a peace deal, telling Russian President Vladimir Putin he needs to make a pact for financial reasons.
This may misread Putin’s apparent pathological commitment to victory, and the broad existential nature of the conflict for Moscow in the eyes of its propagandists. They see this as a war against the entirety of NATO that they must win. The propaganda taps of Russian state media can be turned off as well as on. But Russia’s mindset is radicalized where the West’s is not. It’s not a business case of quarterly profit and loss for the Kremlin, but one of survival.
The second is how regularly Trump talks of the war after excluding it — and any mention of Ukraine and Russia — from his inauguration speech on Monday. He correctly suggested Thursday a lower oil price could impede Russia’s ability to wage war. Russia sells oil to China and India to keep its war machine going, despite sanctions aimed at reducing its revenue.
Trump said he would talk to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, whose troops are fighting for Moscow now in Kursk. He also correctly suggested Beijing has great influence over Moscow and could force a peace deal upon them.
Again, Trump is approaching the conflict from his comfort zone: one where everyone is seeking a smooth deal that makes them richer. China may seek calm, and perhaps ultimately wish the Ukraine conflict had never begun. But that is not the reality of now, and instead Xi Jinping is treading a delicate path: watching his ally Moscow degrade their military and economy to the extent they become Beijing’s junior partner, while also realising Russia cannot lose the fight without a knock-on impact to China’s global ambitions.
The calculations made now by America’s adversaries concern the world order over the coming decade, not the immediate telephone call sheet of the White House, or how fast slick interpersonal dealings might wrap up the biggest land conflict in Europe since the 1940s.
Trump’s repeated call for NATO’s European members to pay more for defense - an unlikely demand of 2% of GDP rising to 5% – has even been echoed by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.
It is correct to state this is Europe’s war. If Kyiv loses, Poland, the Baltics, Romania and Moldova will feel the heat, not Florida or California. Even NATO’s head, Mark Rutte, has suggested Europe might buy arms for Ukraine from the United States. Trump was always going to challenge the cost of the war to Washington, and speedily Europe is being backed into a corner to step up.
It is also intriguing to see Trump talk of the damage the war has done. He said incorrectly Thursday millions had died on both sides. Kyiv has said 43,000 Ukrainian troops have died. The UN says about 12,000 Ukrainian civilians have died.
Western officials say regularly Russia’s losses amount to 700,000 dead and injured, and independent media have tracked nearly 100,000 public records that suggest Russian military deaths on the battlefield.
Yet Trump’s incorrect, emotional reference to millions may be aimed at evoking the urgency and horror of the war in the minds of an American audience for whom it is a side issue rarely discussed.
Trump said he could bring peace to Ukraine in 24 hours, which was always a wild rhetorical exaggeration. Even the six months now evoked is optimistic. But he has taken office seized with a wobbly yet vivid grasp of the war’s issues. That may falter, as he slowly realizes a deal is not low hanging fruit and his adversaries – because that is what Putin is, however “great” Trump says they get along – are more patient, enduring and conniving than he is.
But his opening week has done much to dispel the greater fear from Ukraine and its allies that Trump preferred coziness with Putin to NATO’s unity. Or that his wild and unrealistic promises of diplomacy from the campaign trail would evaporate – along with funding for the war – the moment he came to office. This may all still happen, and the road ahead for Trump is deeply complex and fraught with rivals who have years more experience in the job, and much more to lose or gain.
But Trump is seized of the issue, has an emotional albeit shaky grasp of the war’s horrors, and is critical of, not fawning towards, Putin. It’s yet another unforeseen turn in a conflict ruled by the unexpected.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

But hours later, US President Donald Trump laid bare – in a trademark casual, rambling fashion – his position over the war in Ukraine. And it was tougher on the Kremlin than you might expect.
Talking to reporters in the White House, he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin: “He should make a deal. I think he’s destroying Russia by not making a deal.”
Trump was unprecedentedly stark, focusing on the economic damage done to Russia by the war. “I think Russia is going to be in big trouble. You take a look at their economy. You take a look at their inflation in Russia,” he added, referring to price rises edging towards 10%. “I got along with him great. I would hope he wants to make a deal.”
He loosely referenced Moscow’s staggering casualty rates in a war now nearing its fourth year in which Western officials estimate 700,000 Russians have been killed or injured.
“He can’t be thrilled,” Trump said of Putin. “He’s not doing so well. I mean, he’s grinding it out… it’s not making him look very good… I think he would be well off to end that war.”
Trump said he would meet with Putin, and the details were being arranged. “Could be very soon,” he said. “The war Ukraine and Russia should have never started,” he added. Reminded he had promised to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of being in office, he joked: “I have another half day left. We’ll see. We want to get it done.”
Trump said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he wants to make a deal – an echo of recent comments from Kyiv they were open to diplomacy, provided it created a sustainable end to the war that is palatable to Ukraine. “Zelensky wants to make a deal,” he said. “I don’t know if Putin does. He might not. I don’t know.”
Zelensky welcomed Trump’s inauguration, saying he was a “strong man,” adding: “Ukrainians are ready to work together with Americans to achieve peace, real peace. This is a chance that must be seized.”
The comments constitute some of the most critical Trump has made of the Kremlin head. His focus on economic mismanagement and the Kremlin’s tolerance of horrific casualty rates, suggest his White House is aware Russia may be under some time pressure and intend to exploit it.
Previously, throughout their campaign for the White House, both Trump and Vice President JD Vance had expressed skepticism of continued American involvement in Ukraine’s fight, often suggesting that Ukraine ought to settle for a truce with Russia despite the loss of its territory.
The president’s assertion he wants to meet Putin suggests Trump thinks his interpersonal “art of the deal” may forge a diplomatic path.
Comfortingly also for Kyiv, his reference to aid for Ukraine leant on the need for European NATO members to pay more, rather than for US assistance to stop. Trump began his exchange with reporters by criticizing NATO’s European members, saying they needed to pay 5% of their GDP in defense – almost double for many.
Trump said the United States was funding Ukraine’s assistance to the tune of $200 billion more than Europe. “It’s ridiculous,” he said. “Because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean between.”",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

Of course, no one truly believed Trump would be able end the grinding, three-year conflict in 24 hours, as he implausibly promised repeatedly as a candidate. Even his new special envoy to Ukraine has asked for 100 days to find a solution.
Yet the missed deadline — and the scant mention of the conflict during Monday’s inauguration celebrations — nonetheless underscore how difficult the challenge of ending the fighting in Ukraine will be for the new president, who so far has made no public attempts at brokering peace.
Amid the laundry list of priorities Trump recited during his inaugural address, Ukraine did not warrant a mention. While Trump declared himself a “peacemaker,” he offered no specific pledges of continued American assistance to Kyiv.
For now, it appears Trump’s first order of business will be a talk with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who he accused of “destroying Russia” during remarks in the Oval Office on Monday.
“He can’t be thrilled, he’s not doing so well,” Trump told reporters amid a lengthy signing ceremony, a rare moment of criticism about the Russian president. “Russia is bigger, they have more soldiers to lose, but that’s no way to run a country.”
Asked how long the war would last, he said he couldn’t answer before speaking with the Russian leader.
“I have to speak to President Putin. We’re going to have to find out,” he said.
Indeed, Trump has directed his aides to arrange a phone call with Putin soon, with one goal of the conversation to discuss an in-person meeting in the coming months to try ending the war in Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. Now that Trump is in office, US and Russian officials can begin work in earnest on setting up an in-person meeting. Switzerland and Serbia have both said they’d be willing to host.
Any talks between the two men will reflect a sharp break from former President Joe Biden’s approach. He hadn’t spoken directly with Putin in almost three years, wary any conversation would be useful toward resolving the conflict.
Trump sees things differently. His view, described by a person familiar with his thinking, is that direct engagement with Putin is exactly what is needed to find a solution to end the war.
“How the hell are you going to find a way out the mess if you’re not talking?” the person said, describing Trump’s approach.
What exactly that solution looks like isn’t clear, though officials privately acknowledge it will almost certain require concessions on the part of the Ukrainians.
“The president said when he was campaigning, he wants the dying to stop,” new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday on NBC. “He wants the destruction to stop. I think that’s in everyone’s interest. Now, will that be easy? Will it be complicated? Of course, because every side is going to have to give something.”
Beyond that, it’s largely unknown how much Trump plans to continue the Biden administration’s strategy of providing arms and intelligence to Ukraine, and — beyond opposing Ukraine’s admission to NATO — he hasn’t said what security guarantees he’d be willing to agree to that would satisfy Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Nor has he specified who will pay for Ukraine’s rebuilding, although based on his past comments, it’s unlikely to be the United States.
Speaking on Tuesday, Zelensky seemed concerned about how focused Trump would be on the conflict and suggested European countries need to step up.
The Ukrainian leader suggested that while the United States is an “indispensable” ally to Europe, the relationship might not be fully reciprocal.
“Will President Trump even notice Europe?” Zelensky asked in appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Does he see NATO as necessary, and will he respect EU institutions?”
“Europe can’t afford to be second or third in line for its allies,” Zelensky said.
Zelensky added that Europe “needs to learn how to fully take care of itself,” so that “the world can’t afford to ignore it.”
The Ukrainian leader also urged European countries to stand together to face threats from Russia and Iran, noting the size of Russian army to other European states and suggesting that no European country can stand up to Russia by itself.
“This isn’t a situation where one country can secure itself alone. It’s about all of us standing together to mean something,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/19/europe/ukraine-russia-president-elect-trump-flattery-intl/index.html,Ukraine opens a new front against Russia - flattering Trump,2025-01-19 10:03:40,"World leaders have been rushing to get on Donald Trump’s good side since his reelection as US president, arguably none more so than Ukraine.
In his annual New Year address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had “no doubt that the new American president is willing and capable of achieving peace and ending Putin’s aggression,” in comments that embody his approach to winning over Trump.
Just days later, Zelensky told an American podcaster that Trump won as he was a “much stronger” candidate than Kamala Harris, adding, “He showed that he can do it intellectually and physically.”
Zelensky isn’t alone among prominent Ukrainians in trying to butter up Trump. In November, a Ukrainian MP from Zelensky’s party even nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize, according to a letter seen by the Kyiv Independent.
Such tactics have long been favored by foreign powers. Think of how China took Trump to the Forbidden City or the UK government enlisted the royals during his last term in the White House.
Nor is this an entirely new approach from Ukraine. In what a 2019 CNN opinion article called a “textbook suck-up,” Zelensky could be heard hailing Trump as a “great teacher” on the notorious call in which the then first-term president urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Years on, the stakes could not be higher for Ukraine. Kyiv enters 2025 on the backfoot in its war against Russia, with Ukrainian forces struggling to hold back Russian advances in the east, where they are vastly outnumbered. Its chances of retaking occupied Russian territory anytime soon look increasingly slim.
Under outgoing President Biden, the US became the single largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine and Kyiv remains keenly aware that it needs to stay on Trump’s side to secure future support.
‘Peace through strength’
“Unfortunately, Zelensky does not have the luxury to be hostile towards Trump,” Joanna Hosa, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations told CNN.
“He must at least try to get him on Ukraine’s side in order to secure the best possible outcome for Ukraine, which depends enormously on American support.”
Trump has repeatedly stressed the need to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, suggesting that negotiations could be on the horizon. His envoy’s plan to end the war contains much that will please the Kremlin.
Zelensky has said he wants to “work directly” with the new president and appears more willing to – or perhaps has no choice but to – make battlefield concessions.
“Of course, Ukraine would want to recapture all land it lost. However, after three years of this exhausting war, recapturing all land is nowhere in sight. With a heavy heart, Ukrainians are slowly coming to accept this,” Hosa said.
Zelensky has frequently described Trump as strong, an apparent effort to appeal to a president-elect who has made “peace through strength” a rallying call.
“Trump could be crucial. I think this is the most important thing for us. His qualities are like that. He can be decisive in this war. He can stop Putin,” Zelensky told United News, Ukraine’s wartime TV network, earlier this month.
Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at London-based think tank Chatham House, believes Zelensky’s praise can largely be taken as sincere. She told CNN: “I think he genuinely believes that Trump can make bold moves, and this is where this hope comes from, and not only in Zelensky’s mind but in Ukraine more broadly.”
Aligning interests
Another factor is that unlike previous US administrations, Trump fundamentally believes he can have good relations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He has long expressed his admiration for Putin while other world leaders have shunned him and has pledged to meet with him “very quickly” after he takes office.
For his part, Putin – who was condemned as a “butcher” by Biden – seems open to building ties with Trump. Following Trump’s election win, Putin offered his congratulations, calling him a “courageous man.” During his year-end news conference in December, he said he was ready to meet with him.
Even if Russia is brought to the negotiating table, there’s reason to believe its word cannot be trusted. As CNN’s chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh points out, Moscow’s previous pledges of peace in Ukraine have been characterized by deception, suggesting any potential ceasefire may be in name only.
Lutsevych believes that the Ukrainian government is trying to present Kyiv’s defeat over Moscow as something that would strengthen America’s “power projection” on the world stage.
“This is the game; whether Trump will believe this is a viable strategy is another question,” she said.
And Zelensky has offered other benefits. In October last year, he pitched the idea of swapping out some US forces based in Europe with Ukrainian troops once Russia’s war in Ukraine is over. He argued that the wartime experience of Kyiv’s forces could be put to good use, bolstering NATO – the military alliance which Ukraine has been offered assurances it will join – and helping to ensure security in Europe, something that is likely to appeal to a US leader who has demanded Europe do more on defense.
Zelensky has also appealed to Trump’s business-focused mind. His so-called ‘Victory Plan,’ unveiled in October last year, includes a significant deal with the US on minerals – a critical resource Ukraine is rich in.
According to a report in the New York Times, the signing of the minerals deal was pushed back twice, with the possible motive of allowing Trump to take credit for it when he takes office.
Lutsevych posited that Kyiv would be making a lucrative offer to the US, in economic terms. “We’ve seen that in this ‘Victory Plan,’ that it includes critical minerals, it includes investments… [Ukraine is] basically trying to say that it can be profitable for America.”
But while flattering Trump is a common tactic, his unpredictability means there are few guarantees it will work.
Trump’s welcome by then-British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, back in 2019 did not stop him from firing off a series of angry tweets moments before stepping off his plane, describing London Mayor Sadiq Khan as a “stone cold loser.” He then labeled then-British Prime Minister Theresa May as “foolish.”
Hosa believes there is evidence Zelensky’s approach is paying off, with Trump acknowledging it would take longer than 24 hours to end the conflict – a claim he made in July 2024 – in a sign of his shifting attitude.
“He [Zelensky] faced a choice: flatter Trump or be forced to capitulate to Putin,” Hosa said.
“Flattery is a small price to pay for a better outcome than that.”",['Sophie Tanno'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/18/europe/russia-ukraine-strike-kyiv-atacms-intl/index.html,Russia strikes kill three in central Kyiv at critical moment in Ukraine conflict,2025-01-18 13:05:00,"Three people were killed and three others were injured in an attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on Saturday, according to officials, in a move Russia said was in retaliation for Ukraine using US-made ATACMS missiles.
The deaths and injuries occurred in the city’s central Shevchenkivskyi district, Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv city military administration, said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X that residential buildings, a metro station, businesses, and other civilian infrastructure were damaged in the strike.
“All those who help the Russian state in this war must be under such pressure that it is no less noticeable than these strikes,” Zelensky said. “We can do this only in unity with the entire world.”
Kyiv has regularly been targeted in the conflict but deadly attacks are rare. The attack comes as the war reaches a critical point, with both sides seeking to gain an advantage ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration for a second term as US president.
Videos from the scene, verified and geolocated by CNN, show a large crater in the middle of the road next to the metro station. The station itself is also damaged.
The attack on Kyiv was carried out in response to Ukrainian forces using US-made ATACMS missiles in Russia’s Belgorod region, the Russian Defense Ministry said.
The strike targeted “facilities of the Ukrainian military-industrial sector,” the defense ministry wrote, adding that “the targets of the strike were achieved and all objects were hit.”
A total of 39 drones and four missiles were launched by Russia into Ukraine from Friday evening to Saturday morning, Ukraine’s Air Force Command wrote on Telegram.
Also on Saturday, ten people were injured following missile strikes in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with two more reported missing, a Telegram post by Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said.
Two of the injured were treated on the spot while the others have been hospitalized. A 48-year-old woman is in serious condition, Fedorov added.","['Maria Kostenko', 'Catherine Nicholls', 'Manveena Suri']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/18/africa/russia-expanding-influence-in-africa-intl-cmd/index.html,Russian influence in Africa is growing. What might Moscow want?,2025-01-18 05:01:57,"While Russian ally Bashar al-Assad was being toppled by rebels in Syria, another friend of Moscow, President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, was being chaperoned by Kremlin-backed mercenaries in the conflict-ridden Central African Republic (CAR), where armed groups are yearning to oust him.
“Without the protection of Wagner (a private Russian military force), he (Touadéra) could not be president at this time,” Aboubakar Siddick, spokesperson for an alliance of rebel groups in CAR, known as the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC-F), told CNN.
Siddick said that the CPC-F rebels were feeling “inspired” by Assad’s ouster, stating: “Touadéra’s dismissal is imperative.”
In a sign of the importance Russia places in its relationships in Africa, Vladimir Putin met Thursday with Touadéra in Moscow, in what were the Russian president’s first international talks this year.
“This is connected to the fact that we are developing relations with the Central African Republic in all possible areas, including highly sensitive areas related to security. And we intend to develop this cooperation further,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov ahead of the meeting.
Decades of conflict in CAR mirror the instability in other fragile African states where reliance on Russia’s military offerings has become increasingly prevalent, amid an aggressive push by Moscow to lessen Western influence on the continent.
As Russia’s foothold in Africa expands – notably in the mineral-rich Sahel region that is beset by recurring coups, armed rebellion and extremist insurgency – anti-Western sentiments, partly fueled by Russian propaganda, are engineering the exit of Western troops from swathes of territory. The Kremlin is the most favored to fill the vacuum they leave.
Ivory Coast and Chad are the latest in a string of former French colonies in West and Central Africa to demand the withdrawal of French and other Western forces from their territories, treading in the path of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Those three, all now controlled by juntas, have since turned to Russia for security support, ignoring calls from their Western ex-partners for a swift return to civilian rule.
Moscow is also a sought-after partner by non-French former colonies such as Equatorial Guinea, which hosts an estimated 200 military instructors deployed by Russia in November to protect the Central African nation’s presidency. Its authoritarian leader President Teodoro Obiang, 82, has ruled the tiny, oil-rich country for 45 years following a coup in 1979.
Outside West and Central Africa, Russia is bolstering its presence in the continent’s north, where Wagner forces back eastern Libya’s de facto ruler, Gen. Khalifa Haftar.
Following Assad’s ouster as Syrian leader last month, Moscow has operated multiple flights to and from an airbase in eastern Libya — some headed to Mali, CNN found — suggesting a shift from the Syrian bases that have served as a hub for its military operations in Africa and the Mediterranean region.
Statues honor Wagner figures in CAR
In CAR, an erstwhile French colony, the Russian mercenaries that have operated in the country since 2018 have become the dominant force, following the final exit of French troops in 2022.
At Thursday’s meeting with Putin, Touadéra thanked the Russian leader for supporting his nation and helping it to achieve stability.
“Today, the army trained by Russian instructors is capable of repelling terrorists and anyone who encroaches on the territory of CAR. We will continue to work together to strengthen security throughout the country, at the borders, wherever the threat comes from. Russian instructors are truly professionals,” he said.
The French — who deployed to CAR to help stabilize the nation after a coup in 2013 sparked a civil war — retreated over what the armed forces ministry said was CAR’s failure to halt “massive disinformation campaigns” targeting France amid a competition with Russia for influence.
French President Emmanuel Macron last week slammed African leaders for showing “ingratitude” over the deployment of his nation’s troops in the Sahel, saying that Sahel states only remained sovereign because of the arrival of French forces.
Macron also dismissed the notion that French troops had been expelled from the region, adding that France was only “reorganizing itself” on the continent. “We left because there were coups d’état… France no longer had a place there because we are not the auxiliaries of putschists.”
A US State Department report published last February outlined how Kremlin-funded disinformation had taken root across Africa with the creation of a pro-Russia news agency called the “African Initiative” — which, with the help of hired local journalists, markets Moscow to the continent while tarnishing the West’s reputation.
CAR’s army, bolstered by Russia’s Wagner mercenaries, United Nations forces and Rwandan troops, has battled to keep armed groups such as the CPC-F at bay and reclaim territory seized by rebels. But it is the Russians who are widely credited with helping the nation stave off collapse.
Statues honoring the late Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and top commander, Dmitry Utkin, were unveiled in CAR’s capital, Bangui, in December, a Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group reported. Both men were killed in a plane crash northwest of Moscow in August 2023, two months after they had launched an abortive rebellion against Russia’s military leadership.
Wagner, rebranded as the Africa Corps and placed under the umbrella of the Russian defense ministry after Prigozhin’s death, still operates under the Wagner brand in CAR, where its mercenaries are possibly the group’s most active in Africa.
CAR’s communications minister, Maxime Balalou, told CNN the statues were “inaugurated as part of the cooperation between our country and Russia,” adding that a bilateral defense agreement “allowed Russia to provide us with weapons” as well as “handling and training for our defense and security forces, (and) assisting our armed forces on the ground.”
Another monument, depicting Wagner troops guarding a local woman and her children, was erected in Bangui three years ago.
“Russia’s significant contribution helped stabilize and secure CAR,” Balalou said, adding that “at the height of CAR’s crisis, we were abandoned… but Russia responded.”
Protection – at what cost?
Not everyone views Russia’s involvement in Africa through a positive lens.
The Kremlin’s guns-for-hire mission is far from humanitarian, according to Irina Filatova, a Russian historian specializing in African history. It’s a mixed quest for power and cash, she said, as Moscow hunts for alternative revenue to sustain its war in Ukraine amid a raft of Western sanctions.
“The Russians are providing this support (to troubled African nations) in exchange for either the full control or a percentage of the control from their mineral resources. That is what Russia needs: It needs funding, and it needs influence. It helps its war in Ukraine,” Filatova, a senior research associate at the University of Cape Town, told CNN from South Africa.
In CAR, Martin Ziguélé, a former prime minister and current opposition MP, told CNN that Wagner’s remuneration for providing military services to his nation “is done in an extremely hidden and discreet manner” by the Touadéra-led government.
Previous CNN investigations found that companies linked to ex-Wagner leader Prigozhin had won concessions to mine gold and diamonds in CAR, where nearly 70% of the population lives in extreme poverty — the fifth highest poverty rate in the world, according to a World Bank assessment in 2023.
One of those companies owns rights to the Ndassima gold mine, located 440 kilometers (273 miles) east of Bangui, whose gold proceeds are valued at over $1 billion, according to the US Treasury Department.
“Authorities have no right of inspection,” Jean-Fernand Koena, who heads a union of CAR’s journalists, told CNN about what he said was Wagner’s total control of the Ndassima mine.
CAR’s government, he said, cannot monitor “where the gold that they (Prigozhin-linked company) mine goes,” adding that there is “neither public accounting nor information from the ministry of mines.”
CNN has contacted the mines ministry for comment.
The US Treasury Department said in a statement announcing sanctions in June 2023 that the company, Midas Ressources, had “in conjunction with the Wagner Group” denied “CAR government officials the ability to inspect the Ndassima mine.”
The same statement said another company affiliated with Prigozhin, named as Diamville, had “shipped diamonds mined in the CAR to buyers in the UAE and Europe.”
The Treasury further reported that in 2022 (the year Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine), two companies – Diamville and Industrial Resources – took part in a gold-selling scheme to convert CAR-origin gold into US dollars and that the latter knowingly “participated in the transfer by hand of cash to Russia” — in a bid to bypass US sanctions on Russian financial institutions.
‘Win-win cooperation’
A report by the World Gold Council, an international association of gold producers, puts Wagner’s earnings from its illicit gold dealings at an estimated $2.5 billion since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine.
“This includes the profits from mines and refineries under Russian control, as well as retainers for security services, in CAR, Sudan and Mali,” the report said.
In 2022, CNN also investigated Russia’s plunder of Sudan’s gold, uncovering more than a dozen Russian gold-smuggling flights out of the war-torn country in exchange for backing its military leadership.
The following year, CNN uncovered evidence that Wagner had been arming a Sudanese militia group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which is engaged in a bitter war with Sudan’s armed forces for control of the country. Both Prigozhin and the RSF denied this at the time.
For CAR, the murky underbelly of its military partnership with Russia also comes “at the cost of serious violations of human rights,” Koena said.
Wagner’s alleged atrocities in Africa are widely reported. In CAR, its forces were found to have “summarily executed, tortured, and beaten civilians” since 2019, according to a 2022 report by the rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Balalou, the communications minister, did not address these allegations but told CNN: “We are developing a new form of win-win cooperation with Russia.” He didn’t specify what this entailed.
Vladislav Ilin, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in CAR, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
Outside CAR, similar atrocities, including the killing of civilians, have been committed by Wagner, the HRW claimed in another report last year, this time uncovering the group’s alleged deadly activities in Mali, where it partners with the West African nation’s military to fight insurgents.
Wagner has suffered some of its worst losses on the continent in Mali.
In response to a question from CNN about the nature and scope of Russia’s military partnerships on the continent, the Kremlin’s Peskov said: “We are purposefully developing our cooperation with African countries, including interaction in sensitive areas related to security.”
The Russian Ministry of Defense has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment on the widespread allegations of abuse and misconduct attributed to Wagner forces in CAR and Mali.
Competition for influence
The Kremlin isn’t the only foreign power jostling for influence in Africa.
With the US largely focused on the Middle East, China has made deep inroads into the continent over decades, expanding military ties and claiming the title of Africa’s top trading partner for the past 15 years, according to Beijing.
China has also financed tens of billions worth of development projects across Africa, including under its flagship Belt and Road global infrastructure drive launched in 2013.
Projects under the initiative’s umbrella have generated accusations of lax environmental and labor standards, as well as risky lending, with critics saying China has saddled low- and middle-income governments with overly high levels of debt relative to their GDPs. Beijing has sought to push back on Western criticism over those debts.
Mutasim Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, a Canadian NGO, told CNN that in his view, Russia and China tend to share a common trait in their dealings with Africa.
“Russians and Chinese do not care about democracy, human rights violations, corruption, and the like… They’re happy to protect dictators and human rights violators. That’s one of the reasons why Russians are getting a lot more influence,” he said, contrasting their approach with Western powers such as the US and France, who prioritize democracy and human rights protections.
A report by the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies in 2022 highlighted concerns over abusive labor practices, unsafe working conditions and lack of transparency among Chinese-owned companies operating in southern Africa.
The Chinese Mission to the African Union has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment on the claim China does not prioritize democracy and human rights protections in its dealings with African states.
China and Russia were the main arms suppliers to sub-Saharan Africa between 2019 and 2023, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
Addressing African delegates at a summit in Beijing in September, President Xi Jinping claimed ties between Beijing and Africa were their “best in history,” as he pledged billions of dollars in financial support for the continent, in addition to $140 million in military aid.
A Chinese foreign ministry statement issued after the summit said Beijing was committed to building a “shared future” with Africa and that “China will continue to respect African countries’ political and economic choices based on their own national conditions and honor the principles of noninterference in African countries’ internal affairs.”
In Koena’s view, China’s policy of non-interference speaks to how different powers operate in Africa, with China focusing on economics and Russia on security.
“In a renewed resentment against Western policy in Africa, China is imposing itself on the economic level through trade and infrastructure while Russia wants to be the military response for the stability of sometimes autocratic regimes,” he said.
For Koena’s country, CAR, which has experienced decades of instability, “the message of peace and security gets across more quickly than the economy,” he added. For as long as this continues, the Russian military presence will likely be welcomed by its leaders.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/16/europe/russia-iran-treaty-ukraine-trump-intl/index.html,Russia-Iran treaty raises the stakes for Trump’s administration,2025-01-17 00:01:57,"Just three days before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House, Russia and Iran have finally signed a “comprehensive partnership agreement” – a deal that had been in the works for months.
The move refocuses attention on a partnership that has shaped the battlefield in Ukraine, and which remains committed to challenging the US-led international order - even as the new US administration promises greater engagement with Russia.
Russian and Iran share a complicated past, peppered with conflict, and even now tread a fine line between cooperation and mistrust. And yet, the war in Ukraine has pulled Moscow and Tehran closer.
“That idea of having the United States not just as an adversary but as a strategic objective of all of their foreign policy has brought them together,” Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, D.C., told CNN. “It’s brought them together on the battlefields of Ukraine.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the new agreement and welcomed the chance to discuss the burgeoning “strategic partnership.” His Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, said the relationship between the nations was growing “day by day.”
Unlike Russia’s security pact with North Korea, the deal with Iran does not require the two countries to come to the other’s defense if one is attacked; merely not to provide military or other assistance to the attacker.
In July 2022, five months into his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin visited Tehran, his first wartime trip outside the former Soviet sphere.
Behind the photo ops and handshakes, his “special military operation” was not going to plan. His army had lost a lot of its initial gains as it was pushed out of the Kyiv region - and would go on to lose more later that year in two further successful Ukrainian counteroffensives.
Turning to Tehran bore fruit for Russia. Thanks to a deal inked following that visit, Russia is now churning out thousands of Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones, at a factory in Tatarstan. A CNN investigation in December found production rates at the facility had more than doubled in 2024.
Those drones have formed the backbone of Moscow’s attritional war, swarms of them – targeting civilian areas and energy infrastructure in an effort to break the resolve of Ukraine’s people and deplete its air defenses.
Russia deployed over 11,000 in Ukraine last year, according to a CNN tally of air force reports, more than four times the estimate of just over 2,500 in 2023, provided by CNN’s sources in Ukraine’s defense intelligence.
Moscow has also, according to the US, taken delivery of Iranian ballistic missiles – and while no evidence of their alleged deployment has surfaced yet, that news alone sent a strong signal to Ukraine’s allies that Putin was willing to escalate.
Less desirably for Moscow, it was also one factor that helped shift the debate around providing Ukraine with permission to fire Western-supplied long-range missiles at military targets in Russia. Several prominent Russian military bloggers claimed in early January, without providing evidence, that Iranian missile launchers and other equipment were being delivered to Russian military training grounds ahead of the deal’s signing.
Two-and-a-half years on from Putin’s Tehran visit, the dynamic has markedly shifted for both sides. Russia now has the advantage in Ukraine. It is gaining territory on the eastern front, and with the help of North Korean soldiers, slowly pushing Ukraine back in the Russian region of Kursk. The incoming Trump administration, to Moscow’s barely concealed glee, wants to start talks, and is making noises about letting Russia keep the territory it occupies, and stalling Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership.
Friday’s meeting between Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian offered Moscow a welcome opportunity to burnish its self-image as a superpower. Russia sees this relationship as “asymmetric,” Jean-Loup Samaan, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. “They still consider themselves as the bigger partner here, and Iran as a regional partner.”
Iran, meanwhile, is feeling decidedly less secure. Nikita Smagin, an independent expert on Russia and Iran, who worked for Russian state media in Tehran before the invasion of Ukraine, says the Pezeshkian administration is rushing to get this treaty signed with Russia amid multiple threats to its security.
“They are frightened by the Trump administration, they are frightened by Israel, they are frightened by the collapse of Assad, the collapse of Hezbollah,” he said, explaining that Iran is looking for a show of support.
Moscow may look to exploit this. The Russians have “a great nose for somebody in trouble,” said Alterman, and may be thinking “we can help them a little bit, but we can get them where we need them and extract more from them that we want.”
What more Russia wants is less clear. It has now indigenized Shahed production on Russian soil - and having paid its dues to Iran under an initial franchise deal to manufacture them, is now doing so with much less direct Iranian involvement.
Russia’s recent battlefield gains have come at a huge cost to its troops - so while its manpower issues are nowhere near the level of Ukraine’s, it could use more boots on the ground. But experts are skeptical Iran would be as amenable in this regard as North Korea, which has deployed around 11,000 of its troops in Russia’s Kursk region, according to Ukrainian and Western assessments.
“Even when Iran is fighting their wars outside Iran, they are not willing… to sacrifice their soldiers,” said Smagin, “and when we’re talking about Iran and Russia there is a very big background of distrust from the Iranian side to Russia.” And Russia may be wary of any mutual defense pact, given the more immediate threat to Iran from Israel.
“I think this is partly intended as a message to the Trump administration that we each have options,” said Alterman. “I think the Iranians are looking for tools they can use with the Americans… and there’s a sense that this gives them something to trade or something to talk about.”
Iran, facing the prospect of a possible revival of UN sanctions that were lifted under its 2015 nuclear deal, is urgently looking for ways to persuade the US to rejoin that deal, which Trump exited in 2018 - or restart negotiations.
For Russia, the new treaty with Iran – a country which might be closer than ever to being capable of producing a nuclear weapon – may be partly about dangling the specter of further escalation before a new US administration that it sees as less committed to Ukraine.
“The Iranians certainly have some worrying capabilities, the Russians certainly have demonstrated a willingness to use worrying capabilities,” Alterman said.",['Clare Sebastian'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/16/world/british-pm-diplomacy-ukraine-allies-analysis-intl/index.html,"British PM caps a week of frenzied diplomacy, as Ukraine’s European allies try to strengthen its hand",2025-01-16 18:10:20,"The British prime minister’s visit to Kyiv, his first since taking office in July, caps a week of hurried diplomatic activity by Ukraine’s NATO allies, keen to prove their commitment as uncertainty hangs over the incoming Trump administration.
The “100-year partnership” – the centerpiece of Keir Starmer’s visit – did have an air of a PR stunt about it in a country that has no idea what will happen in one year, and the text of the agreement didn’t offer anything revolutionary. The UK is already the third biggest military donor to Ukraine (though it’s given just over 10% of what the US has) and the two countries inked a bilateral security cooperation agreement last year. The 100-year deal adds maritime security, social integration, and a new UK program to track stolen grain to the slate, but none of those comes close to the security guarantees Ukraine is looking for, a point Starmer indirectly acknowledged. “We will work with you and all of our allies on steps that would be robust enough to guarantee Ukraine’s security,” he promised in a press conference in Kyiv.
Ukraine is on the clock here. The Institute for the Study of War estimates Russia gained more than 4,000 square kilometers of territory in 2024 (some of it retaken from Ukrainian forces in its own Kursk region), more than 10 times its total gains in 2023, though it came at significant manpower cost. The Trump administration has made clear it will push for a diplomatic solution that may involve Ukraine accepting these losses.
And so “peace through strength,” as Starmer posted on X Thursday, has become the refrain. In other words, try to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, economically, politically and militarily, to negotiate. The same motto was in used in Warsaw, Poland, on Wednesday when President Volodymyr Zelensky met Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who promised to accelerate Ukraine’s path to EU membership. Germany, Ukraine’s second biggest military backer, sent its defense minister to Kyiv Tuesday, with the promise of a brand-new artillery system.
Perhaps the strongest signal of support came from French President Emmanuel Macron, who called Zelensky on Monday to discuss, among other things, a French proposal to deploy “military contingents” in Ukraine – European boots on the ground – as a deterrent against any Russian effort to advance further into the country or beyond. “This is an issue that we are all discussing,” said Starmer Thursday, “but it must be capable of deterring future aggression. So that’s the test of any discussion, any conversation that we’re having.”
And perhaps in a sign of the diplomatic challenge ahead, Zelensky and Starmer did not shy away from discussing the elephant in the room – the imminent transfer of power in the US. For Zelensky, who has actively tried to charm the incoming administration in recent weeks, even endorsing Trump’s claim he can end the war quickly, there was no talk of managing without Washington’s help. “We do not consider security guarantees for Ukraine without the United States, so it is too early to talk about the details,” he told reporters.
Starmer took a conciliatory tone, paying tribute to the US contribution so far, and promising: “We can, we will continue to work with the US on this. We are working today. We will work tomorrow.”",['Clare Sebastian'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/16/europe/uk-starmer-ukraine-zelensky-pact-intl-hnk/index.html,UK’s Starmer in Kyiv for security talks with a pledge for a ‘100-year partnership’ with Ukraine,2025-01-16 07:05:20,"Kyiv, Ukraine (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Ukraine’s capital on Thursday with a pledge to help guarantee the country’s security for a century, days before Donald Trump is sworn in as US president.
The British government says Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will sign a “100-Year Partnership” treaty in Kyiv covering areas including defense, science, energy and trade.
Starmer’s unannounced visit is his first trip to Ukraine since he took office in July. He visited the country in 2023 when he was opposition leader, and has twice held talks with Zelensky in London since becoming prime minister. The war will be three years old next month.
The Italian defense chief was also in Kyiv on Thursday, two days after Germany’s defense minister visited and three days after Zelensky talked by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron.
The flurry of diplomatic activity came in the run-up to Trump’s inauguration next Monday, which is expected to bring a departure from the outgoing US administration’s pledge to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia. Trump has also indicated he wants Europe to shoulder more of the burden for helping Ukraine.
On a gray and frosty morning, Starmer was greeted at Kyiv railway station by Martin Harris, the UK’s ambassador to Ukraine, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s envoy to London.
“We’re a long way into this conflict,” Starmer said. “We mustn’t let up.”
The UK, one of Ukraine’s biggest military backers, has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($16 billion) in military and civilian aid since Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago, and has trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Starmer is to announce another 40 million pounds ($49 million) for Ukraine’s postwar economic recovery.
But the UK’s role is dwarfed by that of the United States, and there is deep uncertainty over the fate of American support for Ukraine once Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The president-elect has balked at the cost of US aid to Kyiv, says he wants to bring the war to a swift end and is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long expressed admiration.
Kyiv’s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump’s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war.
Zelensky has said that in any peace negotiation, Ukraine would need assurances about its future protection from its much bigger neighbor.
Britain says its 100-year pledge is part of that assurance and will help ensure Ukraine is “never again vulnerable to the kind of brutality inflicted on it by Russia,” which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and attempted a full-scale invasion in February 2022.
The deal commits the two sides to cooperate on defense - especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov - and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.
“Putin’s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure. Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level,” Starmer said ahead of the visit.
“This is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come.”
Zelensky says he and Starmer also will discuss a plan proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron that would see troops from France and other Western countries stationed in Ukraine to oversee a ceasefire agreement.
Zelensky has said any such proposal should go alongside a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO. The alliance’s 32 member countries say that Ukraine will join one day, but not until after the war. Trump has appeared to sympathize with Putin’s position that Ukraine should not be part of NATO.
As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains ahead of possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia’s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.",['Associated Press'],en

The incoming US leader has pledged to bring a quick end to the fighting, but with few details available on how he would achieve this his arrival at the White House brings great uncertainty to a full-blown Russian invasion about to enter its fourth year.
Overnight on Monday into Tuesday, Kyiv carried out what it said was its “most massive” attack of the conflict so far, attacking deep inside Russia with drones and missiles, including six US-made long-range ATACMS ballistic missiles, Ukrainian and Russian officials said.
Outgoing US President Joe Biden gave the green light for Ukraine to use American longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia in November last year, something Moscow sees as a major escalation.
Moscow has previously warned that the use of ATACMs would be met with the firing of Russia’s new weapon, an intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile known as “Oreshnik.” The missile has only been fired once before, on November 21.
The Ukrainian army said that military and oil facilities were targeted in their latest barrage, saying such attacks would continue “until the Russian Federation’s armed aggression against Ukraine is completely stopped.”
Russia launched its own bombardment of Ukraine overnight into Wednesday, predominantly targeting Ukraine’s beleaguered energy sector.
According to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, the overnight attacks involved more than 40 missiles, of which 30 were destroyed. More than 70 Russian attack drones were also involved.
“Another massive Russian attack. It’s the middle of winter, and the target for the Russians remains the same: our energy sector,” Zelensky said in a Wednesday statement.
“The targets include gas infrastructure and energy facilities that ensure normal life for people.”
The attack forced Ukraine’s state energy company, Ukrenergo, to temporarily shut off its power supplies – a measure it takes to prevent the energy system from collapsing. Power was restored by 9 a.m. local time on Wednesday, it said.
Russia has repeatedly pounded Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during the cold winter months, forcing the country to implement emergency power outages.
The uptick in strikes comes in the lead up to Trump’s inauguration on January 20.
Nikolai Patrushev, an advisor to Putin, rejected the idea that Russia might be willing to concede any occupied territory to Ukraine, in an interview with Russian newspaper Komsomolyskaya Pravda, published Tuesday.
He also said Ukraine could cease to exist as a sovereign state in 2025, without offering further explanation.
“It can’t be ruled out that Ukraine will cease to exist at all in the coming year,” Patrushev said.
In a separate development, reports have emerged that an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine may have been killed by Russia, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledging to take the “strongest action possible,” if confirmed.

Oscar Jenkins was captured by Russian forces last month, after which a video surfaced of him being questioned while dressed in a military uniform.
This week Australian national broadcaster ABC and CNN affiliate Seven News reported that the 32-year-old has likely been killed, both citing sources in Ukraine.
Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government has been “seeking urgent clarification” on the situation, adding it is “gravely concerned.”
“We have called in the Russian ambassador already,” he said.
“We will await the facts to come out. But if there has been any harm caused to Oscar Jenkins, that is absolutely reprehensible. And the Australian government will take the strongest action possible.”
He declined to elaborate on what actions Canberra might take.
A video showing Jenkins being taken as a prisoner of war surfaced on Russian Telegram accounts last month, which CNN has been unable to geolocate. In the footage, Jenkins’ hands are tightly bound, and he appears to struggle to understand questions posed to him in Russian. A man strikes him twice across the head.
Speaking in a mix of English, Ukrainian and Russian, he identifies himself as “a soldier” and says he is a teacher in China and a student in Australia.
Jenkins is thought to have joined an international brigade among the Ukrainian ranks, which have recruited many foreign fighters since the war began in February 2022. The Australian government advises its citizens against traveling to Ukraine to fight, but some have nonetheless chosen to volunteer with international brigades.
At least seven Australians are believed to have died fighting in Ukraine, according to ABC, but none was known to have died while being held captive.
Prisoner of war
Originally from Melbourne, Jenkins has worked as a university lecturer in the Chinese city of Tianjin since 2017, according to a LinkedIn profile under his name.
If he was killed, he would be the first Australian to have died while being held as a prisoner of war in more than half a century. The last person to have died under such circumstances was H. W. Madden, who was captured during the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the Australian War Memorial.
Australia has repeatedly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has given Kyiv close to $1 billion in assistance since 2022, while its military has provided training for Ukraine’s armed forces.
Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong was in Kyiv last month to announce new assistance packages, and the reopening of Canberra’s embassy in the Ukrainian capital.
During an interview with ABC on Wednesday, Wong said her department has been “working very hard” to ascertain the facts surrounding Jenkins’ safety.
“Russia is obliged to treat all prisoners of war in accordance with international humanitarian law,” Wong said. “I want to be clear all options are on the table.”
Multiple reports have emerged throughout the course of Russian troops executing prisoners of war which is a war crime under international law.","['Eric Cheung', 'Hilary Whiteman']",en

After Ukraine first launched ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles into Russia last year, Moscow responded on Nov. 21 by launching a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile known as “Oreshnik”, or Hazel Tree, at Ukraine.
Russia’s defence ministry said it had shot down all of the Western missiles fired by Ukraine at the Bryansk region, as well as 146 drones outside the war zone. It said two more Storm Shadows had been shot down over the Black Sea.
“The actions of the Kyiv regime, supported by its Western curators, will not go unanswered,” the defence ministry said.
The Ukrainian General Staff said it had struck as deep as 1,100 km (680 miles) inside Russia, targeting oil storage, refinery, chemical and ammunition plants in the Bryansk, Saratov, Tula and Tatarstan regions.
Kyiv did not say exactly how it struck the targets, but said that drone and missile forces were among the units involved in the attack.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in November that the Ukraine war was escalating towards a global conflict after the United States and Britain allowed Ukraine for the first time to launch their missiles deep inside Russia.
President-elect Donald Trump has pushed for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the war quickly, leaving Washington’s long-term support for Ukraine in question.
Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
Drone attack
The drone attack on Russia was one of the biggest to date.
Roman Busargin, governor of the Saratov region about 720 km (450 miles) southeast of Moscow, said the cities of Saratov and Engels, on opposite banks of the Volga River, had been subjected to a mass drone attack and there was damage to two industrial sites. Schools had shifted to remote learning, he said.
Ukraine attacked the same region last week and claimed to have struck an oil depot serving an airbase for Russian nuclear bomber planes, causing a huge fire that took five days to put out.
The Ukrainian General Staff said it had hit the Kristall Plant oil storage facility in Engels, part of an operation run by Ukrainian drone units and military intelligence.
The General Staff also said it had struck the Bryansk Chemical Plant, which it said produced ammunition for artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, aviation, engineering ammunition and components for cruise missiles.
The drone attack struck a munitions storage facility holding guided bombs and missiles at the Engels airbase in Russia’s Saratov region as well as other targets, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine said on Tuesday.
The General Staff said attacks on the Saratov Oil Refinery and the Kazanorgsintez plant triggered fires.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/14/europe/ukraine-trump-putin-analysis-intl/index.html,Putin has tested the West’s resolve over Ukraine. Will Trump force its collapse?,2025-01-12 00:00:00,"British wartime leader Winston Churchill once said he was an optimist, as there was no point being anything else. The year ahead in Ukraine has given rise to wild, perhaps wilful, positivity from Kyiv and – publicly at least – in parts of NATO that the incoming Trump White House can effect meaningful, diplomatic change.
They have little choice, as the extent of American backing will decide the outcome of this war, and Trump’s inner circle is far from persuaded, if not already reluctant, to continue the current, nearly-adequate level of support of the Biden administration. Yet Moscow’s track record of negotiation and peace over a decade of war in Ukraine should prove cause for great caution, if not cynicism.
Keith Kellogg, US President-elect Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy, has long floated the basic tenets of an optimist’s peace deal in a policy paper he wrote for a think-tank last April. They involve a ceasefire, Ukraine entering talks as a condition to further military aid, and a possible de-militarized zone, to ensure the current frontlines are frozen. The plan relies greatly on Moscow’s complicity in ending the war on terms devised by the United States, and does not resolve the main problem it assesses – that Ukraine needs more weapons than NATO can comfortably provide. Yet US allies are examining Kellogg’s proposals with some seriousness, to at least, it seems, be ready and able.
A European defense official told CNN there were “active discussions” about how NATO nations might deploy troops to assist with a de-militarized zone, if one became part of any peace deal, and they were requested. Western officials have often reiterated their view that Moscow remains reluctant to open a full-scale conflict with NATO itself.
Perhaps the presence of some NATO troops along Ukraine’s frontlines could restrain the Kremlin from trying to advance slowly - in spite of a ceasefire deal - as it has tried before. On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he has discussed the deployment of “partner contingents” of troops to Ukraine with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. Paris has recently floated the idea of French troops in Ukraine to train, but Ukrainian media went further to speculate this might refer to the germ of a NATO peacekeeping force.
On Sunday, Trump’s incoming national security adviser, US Rep. Mike Waltz, commented to ABC News on the war in Ukraine: “Everybody knows that this has to end somehow diplomatically.” His comments were seized on by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday, who said it meant the Trump team was addressing “the reality on the ground,” Reuters reported.
Trump will inherit a NATO alliance of which he has expressed skepticism and where the unity of message in support of Ukraine is beginning to crumble. While Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz broke months of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic isolation with a phone call in November, NATO’s eastern-most members are acutely aware of the threat of a Kremlin emboldened by partially adhered-to ceasefires, and remain focused on Moscow’s enduring defeat as the best way to guarantee European security.
Kaja Kallas, the former Estonian prime minister and now the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, told CNN from Rome she believed Ukraine could still win with the right aid.
“The stakes for European security are extraordinarily high,” she said. “The scale of hybrid attacks in Europe have already surged and Ukraine’s defeat would cost us far more than aid.
“Putin has shown a total disregard for international law and cannot be trusted. Without credible security guarantees, any ceasefire agreement is likely to fail. Russia will simply rearm and re-attack.” A bad peace deal “will only lead to more war, just as it did before,” she added. “We must learn from the past and ensure any future agreement is sustainable.”
Flawed process
Russia’s previous pledges of peace in Ukraine have been characterized by deception, suggesting a ceasefire may be in name only. In the initial invasion of 2014, Crimea was taken by a small force of “green men” who overwhelmed Ukrainian bases on the peninsula while denying they were Russian military. (Putin later admitted they were).
The mercenary-led “uprisings” that took parts of the Donbas region in the following months were also an unconvincing fig leaf for Moscow’s annexation. Russia often enthusiastically pursued its military goals while talking peace, and in February 2015 completed its advance into the strategic town of Debaltseve, right in the middle of peace talks in Minsk, finally taking the town during the first days of a ceasefire.
Those who were there, remember a flawed process. Alexander Hug, who ran the OSCE monitoring mission on the ground that oversaw the ceasefires of 2014-15, told CNN: “No ceasefire is perfect. Violations are bound to occur. The key question is what the agreement foresees in terms of sanctions and remedial action.” He said that if either side got away with it, “you have an open invitation for more of the same.”
He added, “The situations then and now are not the same” but that the “key lessons drawn 10 years ago remain valid today.”
Moscow’s narrative has also drastically changed over the past decade, as has its casualty rate. In 2014, Putin often pretended to have no control over the “separatist uprisings,” and the Russian military suffered relatively few losses for significant territorial gains. As the war edges into its fourth year, Western officials assess Russia’s incremental gains along the frontline add as many as 1,500 deaths and injuries a day, and the toll nears 700,000 casualties for the war, according to the UK defense ministry.
The Kremlin has also cast the war as an existential battle against all of NATO - perhaps to excuse its faltering performance. On the other hand, NATO has yet to commit troops to the conflict at all, only its less desirable equipment. This imbalance in how the conflict is perceived will warp the negotiating table. Russia simply has more at stake than NATO. And it may make it harder for Putin to accept minor concessions from Kyiv at talks, and rather seek larger gains.
Fast burn of lives
There are hopes Trump’s unpredictability, and apparent desire to avoid seeing on his watch a repeat embarrassment for the US comparable to the withdrawal from Kabul, could resolve him to see Putin fail. But that would require the president-elect to reverse two key constants in his demeanor: a desire to not publicly upset the Kremlin head, and to reduce the United States’ involvement in foreign conflicts.
Kyiv and other NATO members like to evoke the idea of “peace through strength.” But the larger risk of this year is a slow, even torturous, diplomatic process during which Putin’s imperfect adherence to a ceasefire, and likely continued minor territorial gains, leave Ukraine’s allies divided, and unable to decide what level of violation would merit the full involvement of NATO in retaliation.
As in 2014, do you go to war over Crimea, or Debaltseve? If NATO or European troops are deployed along a de-militarized zone, what level of violation, or casualties among them, would merit a NATO retaliation against another nuclear power? Would the Trump White House agree with its European allies?
And once NATO’s unity and intensity of support for Kyiv begin to lapse, and European governments begin to change, it may be hard to reignite. Putin knows this, and has played to it before. But only now does he have such an apparent sympathizer in the White House as Donald Trump.
Time may not entirely be on Putin’s side, given the fast burn of Russian lives, financial reserves, and an economy fiercely overheating from military sign-on bonuses and death payouts. But this year, the Kremlin head will see the one constant that caused the clock to tick loudest in Moscow – the unified backing of NATO for Ukraine – morph into the slow, generous diplomacy he exploited in 2014. That, combined with Russia’s brutal and slow-paced tenacity on the battlefield, may be enough to edge him towards the victory he needs.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/biden-russian-assets-ukraine-european-skepticism/index.html,US encounters European skepticism in last-ditch push to seize $300B in Russian assets for Ukraine leverage,2025-01-14 05:00:43,"With just days left before handing over the keys to the US government, the Biden administration is making a last-ditch effort to seize hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian assets as future negotiating leverage for Ukraine, according to two senior administration officials.
Top Biden aides have been working to convince European partners to support moving some $300 billion of Russian money into a new escrow account that would be released only as part of a peace deal. The money belongs to the Russian Central Bank and was initially frozen three years ago after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Most of that money is still being held in European banks, though a fraction remains in banks based in the US.
Seizing the assets would be meant to send a simple message to Moscow, one senior administration official told CNN: “If you want your money back, you’re going to have to come talk.”
Senior Biden officials have consulted closely on the idea with President-elect Donald Trump’s national security team, including Sen. Marco Rubio, his secretary of state designee, and Rep. Mike Waltz, tapped for national security adviser.
The Trump camp, according to people familiar with the matter, is generally supportive of the strategy, believing that the seized money could give Russia fresh incentive to come to the negotiating table, with Trump wanting to see a swift end to a war he believes has already gone on too long.
The Europeans, however, are not as keen on the idea and have raised concerns about violating international law if banks confiscate Russia’s money outright.
For more than a year, US officials have worked to ease those concerns and find a way to use the frozen Russian money in a way that could benefit Ukraine. In a deal that was seen as a compromise, G-7 countries agreed last year to use interest that had accrued from the frozen investments, which generate a return each year of about $5 billion, as a loan to Ukraine.
The resulting $50 billion loan would be paid back by the investments’ profit over a decade.
With just days to go before a transition of power in Washington, Europeans remain skeptical about confiscating the principle of the frozen Russian cash, sources told CNN, making it highly unlikely that any deal gets done before Trump assumes office.
Senior US officials suggested that Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union party who is poised to become chancellor, is open to the idea of pursuing the strategy – but he hasn’t taken office.
President Joe Biden had expected to discuss the issue with Italian leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a meeting in Rome this week, which the US cancelled as the most destructive fire in Los Angeles’ history raged across the city. Biden spoke by phone with Zelensky last Friday. It’s unclear if the topic of the Russian money came up.
The White House has long been supportive of using the $300 billion in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction and increase Ukraine’s leverage. In recent meetings, Biden has personally broached the topic with G-7 leaders, a White House official said.
In its final weeks, the Biden team has looked for other ways to bolster Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and its balance sheet ahead of Trump’s inauguration. The US last week announced new sanctions on secretive ships transporting Russian energy. That came a day after the White House said it would send a final tranche of $500 million worth of weapons, bringing the total amount of security aid for Ukraine to more than $65 billion.
Biden officials have stressed that they want to leave the Trump administration with the strongest hand possible on Ukraine.
Speaking at a press conference in Paris last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken again stressed that the outgoing administration wants to make sure that, if the Trump administration chooses to negotiate, that it would do so from a “position of strength and that President Trump could get the strongest possible deal.”
Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire to quickly bring the war to a close. Blinken acknowledged that “we’re at a point in the coming year where it may be that the parties will choose to negotiate.”
While the Biden administration has rushed to use as much of the money authorized by Congress to send to Ukraine, it will not have been able to disburse all of it before its term expires next week. There will be “just under $4 billion” in funding from the Presidential Drawdown Authority that will roll over from the outgoing Biden administration to the incoming Trump administration for funding aid to Ukraine, according to a Defense Department spokesperson.
As for the G-7 loan program, the US committed $20 billion toward it and delivered its portion to the World Bank in December. But only $1 billion has been disbursed, with the rest to come on a World Bank schedule, according Ukrainian officials. To what extent the Trump administration could try to claw back the remainder if it hasn’t been delivered is a cause for concern among Ukrainian officials.
The Kremlin called the $1 billion transfer theft and has repeatedly blasted the freezing of its assets.
“This money was stolen from us, and the blocking of our assets is absolutely illegal, violating all norms and rules,” Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last month.
In a recent interview, Zelensky said he told Trump to instead give the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to them to cement the strength of the Ukrainian military as a kind of security guarantee that Ukraine would want for agreeing to end the war.
“Take money, what we need for our interior production, and we will buy all the weapons from the United States,” Zelensky said. “We don’t need gifts from the United States. It will be very good for your industry, for the United States. We will put money there. Russian money, not Ukrainian, not European.”","['Kayla Tausche', 'Alex Marquardt', 'Jennifer Hansler', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

Its troops are on the back foot against Russia along several parts of the long frontline, it is short of experienced soldiers and doubtful that military aid will continue to arrive at anything like the current rate.
In Kyiv, the government waits and watches the signals from Moscow and Washington and reiterates almost daily its desire for a “just peace.” Any thought of recovering the territory seized by Russia is on indefinite hold.
Despite taking heavy losses, Russian forces continue to push forward remorselessly in Donetsk region, one of four that Moscow has illegally annexed and is seeking to fully occupy. Their daily gains are measured in fields and streets as they creep towards the industrial belt of the region.
According to open source analysts WarMapper, Russia is occupying just over 18% of Ukraine – including Crimea and the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk that it had taken before 2022. Russian forces had taken some 150 square miles (400 square kilometers) in December.
Ukrainian units are vastly outnumbered in the east. One commander said this week that small groups of Russian infantry were conducting assaults from multiple directions at once, making it difficult for Ukrainian forces to concentrate fire.
“While the correlation of forces with respect to tactical fires, drones, and long-range strike appears to not be favoring either side to a significant extent, manpower remains the key differentiator between Russia and Ukraine,” says Mick Ryan, who writes the blog Futura Doctrina.
Russian units are now 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the hub of Pokrovsk and have taken control of Kurakhove and part of the town of Toretsk, according to geolocated video.
The commander of one Ukrainian battalion near Pokrovsk said Russian forces there had intensified shelling and glide-bomb strikes.
Military spokesman Viktor Tregubov told Ukrainian television that fighting continued around Kurakhove and troops were holding out at the power plant, “so we cannot say that Russian troops have taken the town completely. But, of course, most of the town has been reduced to rubble.”
The Russian “model of simple attrition is unchanged. The enemy inevitably wears down before the Russian steamroller wears down,” as analysts Keith D. Dickson and Yurij Holowinsky put it.
The goal for Kyiv is to defend what it still holds. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at a meeting with allies – the Ukraine Defense Contact Group – in Germany last week that Ukraine’s priorities this year would be stabilizing the front line and strengthening its defense capabilities.
Contact Group members have committed more than $126 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over the past three years. Partners pledged further aid in Germany this week, including 30,000 drones over the next year and more air defense systems.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday that the coalition “must continue to stand foursquare with Ukraine — and to strengthen Ukraine’s hand for the negotiations that will someday bring Putin’s monstrous war to a close.”
It’s the “someday” that is the burning question. Austin said of the incoming Trump administration: “I won’t speculate on which direction they would go in.”
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius even suggested the incoming US administration might discontinue the Contact Group meetings, saying that if so “it will need to continue in another form.”
Negotiations on ending the conflict seem unlikely at present.
“The reason is simple. Moscow is not ready for any compromises. It plays for victory, not a draw,” says Arkady Moshes, writing in 19FortyFive.
“Success can be achieved on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, but it must be unquestionable. In Putin’s view, Ukraine needs to be defeated, and the West has to admit Ukraine’s – and its own – defeat publicly,” Moshes adds.
Potential peace talks
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, former US general Keith Kellogg, said last week that he hoped to be able to come up with a solid and sustainable solution to the conflict within 100 days. Trump himself had said on the campaign trail that he would get the fighting stopped within 24 hours of taking office, but when asked more recently how soon he could end the conflict said: “I hope to have six months. No, I would think, I hope long before six months.”
How the Kremlin’s unchanged goals square with the incoming Trump administration’s plans is unclear.
Ryan, the Futura Doctrina blogger, believes Putin “is likely to ensure that no matter what, the 100-day objective fails. He has no compelling reason to come to the table right now, thinking he has the momentum in this war.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has given little indication of the parameters that would be acceptable to Ukraine. He said Friday: “We will undoubtedly stand firm and achieve a lasting peace for our people and our country.”
His priority is to make Ukraine’s case to Trump directly. Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi on the same day said Ukraine was preparing for talks at “the highest levels.”
“Our stance is clear: everyone in Ukraine wants to end the war on terms that are fair to Ukraine.”
At the heart of any settlement for Kyiv would be short-term guarantees that a ceasefire could be monitored and longer-term guarantees for Ukraine that would deter Putin from using a ceasefire to re-group and renew hostilities.
That must include “significant investment in airpower, ballistic missile defense, a fully equipped, NATO standard heavy division,” say Dickson and Holowinsky. Meanwhile, they add: “Zelensky must take a strategic long view understanding that the lost territories in reality represent a gangrenous limb that must be cut off to save the healthy body.”
At an absolute minimum Moscow will demand that Ukraine cedes the territory it has lost and abandon its drive to join NATO, which Trump believes was a provocation to Russia.
Instead, Kyiv would have to negotiate other guarantees, as Zelensky said in an interview on Italian television this past week, that would “prevent Russia from returning with aggression.”
But the Kremlin is likely to demand much more.
Kyiv is “expected to accept extensive limitations on the size of its armed forces and on the kinds of weapons systems it is allowed to possess. These proposals are not a recipe for a sustainable settlement,” according to the Atlantic Council’s Serhii Kuzan.
Moscow has shown no sign of abandoning its maximalist demand for the totality of all four regions it claims to have annexed. “This would mean handing over large amounts of unoccupied Ukrainian territory including the city of Zaporizhzhia with a population of around three quarters of a million people,” notes Kuzan.
For now, both the White House and many commentators see no desire by either side to begin talks. “There is no expectation now that either side is ready for negotiations,” US National Security spokesman John Kirby said in recent days.
While both the Kremlin and Trump have expressed readiness for a summit, premature efforts to advance negotiations on the Ukraine conflict could backfire, according to Russian commentator Giorgy Bovt.
“If the meeting is held prematurely, when the conditions for peace are not yet ripe, it will do more harm than good. It could lead to an even greater escalation. At the same time, both warring sides are still betting on the continuation of hostilities, not considering their forces exhausted,” he wrote on Telegram.","['Tim Lister', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina']",en

“Ukraine is ready to hand over (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un’s soldiers to him if he can organize their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia,” Zelensky said Sunday in a post on X that included a video purportedly showing two North Korean POWs being interrogated.
On Saturday, Ukraine said it had captured two North Korean soldiers, marking the first time that Kyiv has captured soldiers alive from the isolated state.
Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have officially acknowledged the presence of North Korean troops in Russia.
CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment, and is seeking comment from North Korea.
In the video shared by Zelensky on Sunday, both soldiers appear injured and are likely speaking under duress. A Korean-speaking voice can be heard translating questions from the interrogator.
One soldier has a wound to his jaw, the other has bandaged hands.
One of the soldiers, who appears in the video lying down, says he did not know he was fighting in a war against Ukraine and that his commanders told him it was a training exercise.
The interrogator, whose voice has been modulated to obscure their identity, asks both soldiers whether they want to return to North Korea, according to a CNN translation of the video.
One nods, the other – after further prompting from the translator, who asks, “Do you like it here in Ukraine? It’s nicer here” – says he wants to stay in Ukraine but adds later that he will do as he is told.
In his daily address later Sunday, Zelensky claimed that one of the soldiers had “expressed a desire to stay in Ukraine.”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was tight-lipped about Zelensky’s offer to swap the captured North Koreans for Ukrainian prisoners taken by Russia, but said the Kremlin was “interested” in discussing potential exchanges.
“We do not know what is true here, who offered what to whom,” Peskov said Monday. “The process is not easy. But the life of each of our soldiers in captivity is important to us. This work will continue.”
According to Ukrainian and Western assessments, some 11,000 North Korean troops are deployed in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces occupy several hundred square kilometers after staging a cross-border incursion in August last year.
Ukraine estimates more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in Kursk, while a senior US official said North Korea has seen “several hundred” casualties – both killed and wounded – in the region since October.
On Monday, South Korean lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun, who was briefed by the National Intelligence Service, said about 300 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia are believed to have died so far with 2,700 injured.
In video released Saturday by Ukraine’s Security Service, a spokesman says one of the North Koreans was captured on January 9 by Ukrainian special forces, and the other by Ukrainian paratroopers.
In his statement on X, Zelensky vowed to capture more North Korean soldiers.
“In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be more. It’s only a matter of time before our troops manage to capture others. There should be no doubt left in the world that the Russian army is dependent on military assistance from North Korea,” Zelensky said on X.","['Adam Pourahmadi', 'Audry Jeong']",en

“Ukraine is ready to hand over (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un’s soldiers to him if he can organize their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia,” Zelensky said Sunday in a post on X that included a video purportedly showing two North Korean POWs being interrogated.
On Saturday, Ukraine said it had captured two North Korean soldiers, marking the first time that Kyiv has captured soldiers alive from the isolated state.
Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have officially acknowledged the presence of North Korean troops in Russia.
CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment, and is seeking comment from North Korea.
In the video shared by Zelensky on Sunday, both soldiers appear injured and are likely speaking under duress. A Korean-speaking voice can be heard translating questions from the interrogator.
One soldier has a wound to his jaw, the other has bandaged hands.
One of the soldiers, who appears in the video lying down, says he did not know he was fighting in a war against Ukraine and that his commanders told him it was a training exercise.
The interrogator, whose voice has been modulated to obscure their identity, asks both soldiers whether they want to return to North Korea, according to a CNN translation of the video.
One nods, the other – after further prompting from the translator, who asks, “Do you like it here in Ukraine? It’s nicer here” – says he wants to stay in Ukraine but adds later that he will do as he is told.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/12/europe/sexual-rehabilitation-demand-ukraine-intl/index.html,Why sexual rehabilitation is now in demand in Ukraine,2025-01-12 05:01:42,"When 35-year-old combat medic Tetyana Tsymbaliuk regained consciousness in the hospital room, she found her boyfriend waiting with a bunch of flowers. He proposed, but she declined. After a serious injury, her leg had been amputated; she worried about being a burden as a wife.
“I realized that before amputation, I was more attractive. I was not sure that I could find a way to fulfil my family role as a woman,” said Tsymbaliuk. It took her a long time to regain her confidence.
Tsymbaliuk says she was one of the first Ukrainian military amputees following the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Almost three years on, nearly 370,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been wounded. Thousands have lost one or more limbs.
While the government does not provide official figures on amputations, a state program issued prostheses to almost 20,000 people across 2023 and the first half of 2024, and many others were helped by private programs in Ukraine and abroad.
In the past two years, Ukraine has implemented protocols for physical and, to some degree, psychological rehabilitation for those injured in conflict. But sexual rehabilitation for people who have lost limbs or suffered other serious injuries has been largely overlooked.
Sex has long been a taboo topic in Ukraine. While modern Ukrainians are more open about sex than in the Soviet era, the topic is still an uncomfortable one for many.
“In our culture, we don’t really have a habit of talking about sex. Not all people can even say this word calmly. It is generally not acceptable to tell a stranger or even a partner about your sex issues,” military psychologist and sexologist Hanna Revunets told CNN, adding that men or women who have lost limbs because of the war rarely ask for help regarding such a sensitive subject.
“If I ask veterans about sex issues, they usually say that everything is okay. Only a few of them after a while, when they start to trust me, can talk about the problems they have,” Revunets said.
There are no protocols or recommendations for sexual rehabilitation on the official governmental level, she said, or even any mention of it.
“That’s important because the doctor is required to work according to protocol,” Revunets said. “Sexual rehabilitation is not specified anywhere, so the doctor can only take the initiative if he or she wants to do so. But most doctors aren’t ready to talk about it.”
It takes time even to persuade some doctors of its significance, Revunets said. “When I tell my colleagues about the importance of sexual rehabilitation, they look at me as if I’m crazy, (someone) who doesn’t understand what kind of serious injuries the patient has,” she said.
A good sexologist can help in many ways. Revunets is one of the very few sexologists in the country who works with the military. “I find out what exactly is wrong with the patient. I ask how the person feels. Depending on this, I give advice - it can be advice on how and what to do from a technical point of view, or what medications to take, or help psychologically.”
‘I was told to have sex, but no one told me how’
The war has resulted in an unprecedented number of people with injuries, a situation for which Ukraine was unprepared. The lack of any information on sexual rehabilitation has motivated the Ukrainian nonprofit Veteran Hub, which is specifically dedicated to supporting war veterans and their families, to study the topic.
In 2023, Veteran Hub researchers conducted 39 in-depth interviews with injured soldiers and their partners. Among other things, interviewees spoke anonymously about their sex lives after injury.
Researchers found that sex itself had changed for many. For example, after being injured, some respondents started to prepare for or plan sexual relations due to physical changes.
One of the veterans in a long-term relationship said of the doctors who treated him: “I was told to have sex, but no one told me how. If we’re talking about the technical part, it is very important.” He told researchers that without formal resources available to them, men were having to pass on information “by word of mouth.”
In response to the researchers’ findings, Veteran Hub created a guide for veterans on how to restore their sexual lives after being wounded.
“We saw that there was a great demand for this topic. After physical rehabilitation, people start asking themselves whether they will be able to swim in the sea, go skiing, go on dates, or have sex. And usually no one can answer these questions,” said Veteran Hub project manager Kateryna Skorohod.
Olga Serdyuk, chief executive of the Olena Pinchuk Foundation, which runs a sexual educational program at a network of rehabilitation centers called Recovery, said: “We need to understand that a wounded person works with different specialists – surgeons, physiotherapists, psychologists – on the way to rehabilitation. Because there is a lack of sexologists in Ukraine, those doctors must be ready for the person to open up to them and talk about sexual rehabilitation.”
To help widen their knowledge, Recovery launched a course called “Sexual Life” to train doctors and other professionals working with Ukrainian soldiers.
Serious injury changes the life of not only the veteran but also their partner, Serdyuk explained.
“For some reason, Ukrainian society believes that a good wife should take care of her husband on her own, even if there is an opportunity to get help. A woman becomes a carer. What kind of sex can we talk about then?” Serdyuk said, referring to how the pressures of full-time caring can lessen a couple’s capacity to explore paths to sexual fulfilment.
“Even if we are talking about complete dysfunction or missing genitals, a person (who’s been injured) can still have an orgasm with pleasure. You have to work with your fantasies, study your body.”
People need to learn to accept themselves in a new way, and believe in their integrity, their body, Serdyuk said.
Ukrainian ‘Bachelor’ stars double amputee
Discussions surrounding disabilities are increasingly cropping up in Ukraine as casualties rise.
Popular dating show “The Bachelor” has taken the discussion into the mainstream, with 26-year-old Ukrainian veteran Oleksandr Budko – who lost both his legs in the war - cast as the star of the latest season.
An episode with an intimate scene, shown in November, became one of the most popular in the season. According to data provided by Starlight Media, a Ukrainian broadcasting group, about 2.8 million people all around the country watched it, making it the most viewed program on the day it aired.
“This is the first time in the history of the show among all countries of the world that a man with a double amputation has become a Bachelor,” show producer Anna Kalyna told CNN.
“We were concerned about how people would react to seeing a person’s body with visible amputations in such an intimate context. There is no representation of people living with injuries in Ukraine and we didn’t know how people would react to it. It was a big challenge. But it turned out well.”
Kalyna thinks the audience was interested, in part, because they realize that in this time of war their own loved ones could be injured at any moment.
On his Instagram page, Budko said he was not taking part in the show to convince anyone of anything or prove his “normality.”
“My prostheses or even sometimes a wheelchair are just a part of me, but not what defines me,” he posted. “The fact that I have a disability does not make me less worthy of love or a happy life. And this is important to understand.”
Budko also posted that his first experience of sex after injury “was not just sex, but a step back to life.”
Choosing life over suffering
Among those to attend Recovery’s “Sexual Life” course is Oleksandr Batalov. The unit infantry commander, who works as an osteopath in civil life, lost his leg in a fierce battle on the front line. He recalls that it took time for him to get used to his changed body.
“At the beginning, with such trauma, you want no one to look at you. But my wife gave me huge support. So, I got a grip. I chose life, not suffering,” he said. The psychologist helped a lot, he added.
There are very few sexologists in the hospitals, he said, but men who have experienced serious injuries are talking about sex with one another, and that’s important. However, “they need to have specialists they can talk to” as well, Batalov said.
That’s why he is starting this course. “If you survived, you have to live. Despite the injury, my life is full and interesting, I want to leave and study and share the knowledge,” said Batalov, who is now working again as an osteopath.
The same goes for Tsymbaliuk, the injured combat medic. She decided to live a fulfilling life no matter what. Her boyfriend did not give up and proposed again.
After months of rehabilitation in Germany, and later in Ukraine’s Superhumans Center, she finally married him, realizing “she was full of love that she wanted to fulfil.” Four months ago, they welcomed their first child together.
“I’m not hiding my prosthetic. I’m living a full life. And I’m happy,” she said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/13/europe/russia-emergency-task-force-kerch-strait-oil-spill-intl-hnk/index.html,Black Sea oil spill: Russia forms emergency task force as Kerch Strait leak spreads,2025-01-13 05:51:12,"(AP) — An emergency task force arrived in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region on Sunday as an oil spill in the Kerch Strait from two storm-stricken tankers continues to spread a month after it was first detected, officials said.
The task force, which includes Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Kurenkov, was set up after Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on authorities to ramp up the response to the spill, calling it “one of the most serious environmental challenges we have faced in recent years.”
Kurenkov said that “the most difficult situation” had developed near the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, where fuel oil continues to leak into the sea from the damaged part of the Volgoneft-239 tanker.
Kurenkov was quoted as saying by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that the remaining oil will be pumped out of the tanker’s stern.
The Emergencies Ministry said Saturday that over 155,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil had been collected since oil spilled out of two tankers during a storm four weeks ago in the Kerch Strait, which separates the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula from the Krasnodar region.
Russian-installed officials in Ukraine’s partially Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region said Saturday that the mazut — a heavy, low-quality oil product — had reached the Berdyansk Spit, some 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of the Kerch Strait. It contaminated an area 14.5 kilometers (9 miles) long, Moscow-installed Gov. Yevgeny Balitsky wrote on Telegram.
Russian-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency last weekend after oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula’s largest city, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Kerch Strait.
In response to Putin’s call for action, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi accused Russia of “beginning to demonstrate its alleged ‘concern’ only after the scale of the disaster became too obvious to conceal its terrible consequences.”
“Russia’s practice of first ignoring the problem, then admitting its inability to solve it, and ultimately leaving the entire Black Sea region alone with the consequences is yet another proof of its international irresponsibility,” Tykhyi said Friday.
The Kerch Strait is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014.
In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office, described the oil spill last month as a “large-scale environmental disaster” and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.",['Associated Press'],en

The ministry said Austria’s embassy in Algeria, which is also responsible for Niger, had been informed of the kidnap of an Austrian woman in Agadez and was in contact with regional authorities on the ground.
Residents and local media identified the victim as Eva Gretzmacher and reported she is an aid worker who has lived in Agadez – hundreds of kilometers (miles) away from the capital city of Niamey – for more than 20 years.
“(She) is well known for her social commitment (and) created a skills center in 2010 that initiated various projects, notably in the fields of education, women’s empowerment, ecology, culture and art,” the local Air Info Agadez reported.
Gretzmacher also supported education programs through her development work and provided assistance to local non-government organizations in various sectors, local media said.
No group claimed responsibility for her abduction and authorities in Niger did not immediately comment on the incident.
Niger has for many years battled a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a security crisis that analysts say has worsened since the military toppled the country’s government in July 2023.
Despite their promise to restore peace in hot spots, the junta’s capacity to improve Niger’s security has increasingly been questioned amid increasing attacks.
Niger was seen as one of the last democratic countries in Africa’s Sahel region that Western nations could partner with to beat back the jihadi insurgency in the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert.

The attack on the Taneco refinery in the city of Nizhnekamsk, Tatarstan – one of the largest and most modern refineries in Russia – was the second time the facility had been struck by Ukrainian forces within the space of a year, according to Lieutenant Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation.
Social media images geolocated by CNN appear to show massive flames and smoke in the dark skies as workers trudge through the snow evacuating from the fiery building.
Despite the footage, the press service of the Republic of Tatarstan denied there had been a fire at the plant, insisting instead that it had been carrying out a mock evacuation as a safety exercise and that the images of the glowing facility in fact showed “the work of the plant’s torches.”
The Taneco refinery has a refining capacity of over 16 million tons of oil per year and “plays a key role in supplying fuel to the Russian army,” according to the Ukrainian official Kovalenko.
“The destruction of refineries and oil depots directly affects Russia’s ability to wage an intense war,” he added.
Kovalenko said the refinery had also been hit in the spring of 2024, in an attack that damaged its primary processing unit.
Last April, Ukrainian drone attacks in Tatarstan targeted both a Shahed drone assembly factory and a primary oil refining unit at the refinery, one of the five largest such facilities in Russia, sources told CNN at the time.
The attack last April was at the time the farthest into Russian territory Ukraine had struck since the beginning of the war.","['Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'Jennifer Hauser']",en

“Our soldiers have captured North Korean military personnel in the Kursk region. Two soldiers, though wounded, survived and were transported to Kyiv, where they are now communicating with the Security Service of Ukraine,” Zelensky said Saturday in a statement on X, which included several images of the injured soldiers.
According to Ukrainian and Western assessments, some 11,000 North Korean troops are deployed in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces occupy several hundred square kilometers after staging a cross-border incursion in August last year.
Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the last week of December.
Zelensky said of the two Korean soldiers who had been captured: “This was not an easy task: Russian forces and other North Korean military personnel usually execute their wounded to erase any evidence of North Korea’s involvement in the war against Ukraine.”
Soldiers in bunk beds
The Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, released video purportedly showing the soldiers.
In the video, the SBU spokesman says one of the North Koreans was captured on January 9 by Ukrainian special forces, and the other by Ukrainian paratroopers.
“They are being held in appropriate conditions that meet the requirements of international law,” the SBU said.
The video shows the two soldiers in bunk beds in a cell. One has a wound to his jaw. Neither is heard speaking. An unidentified doctor says that the second soldier has a fractured leg.
The SBU spokesman said that “communication with them is carried out through interpreters of Korean,” in cooperation with South Korean intelligence services.
Saturday’s capture is the first time that Ukraine has caught North Korean soldiers alive from the battlefield.
The SBU released images of a Russian military ID card issued in the name of another person from Tuva in Russia, which it said was being carried by one of the captured soldiers. According to the SBU, the soldier said he had been issued the document in Russia last autumn. He also said that some of North Korea’s combat units had just one week of training with Russian troops. The other captive had no documents, the SBU said.
The soldier said he had been in the North Korean military and had thought he was being sent to Russia for training rather than combat, according to the SBU’s account.
It comes as Ukraine on Sunday renewed its offensive on Kursk, where its troops have been holding territory after last summer’s shock incursion.
Ukraine’s military said on Tuesday that it had conducted a precision strike on a Russian military command post near the town of Belaya.
Although Kyiv’s troops quickly advanced through Kursk in the summer – in the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – Russia eventually managed to push the forces back. The lines had been mostly static for weeks before Ukraine’s latest push.
In his daily address on Monday, Zelensky said the Kursk offensive was important in preventing Russia from redirecting its troops to Donetsk and other regions in eastern and southern Ukraine.
Despite both sides being drained after nearly three years of war, frontline fighting has ramped up in recent weeks. With Donald Trump set to return to the White House this month – promising to end the war in a day, without saying how – Moscow and Kyiv appear to be making an 11th-hour push to gobble up territory and strengthen their negotiating hands ahead of potential peace talks.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/biden-admin-russia-energy-sanctions-ukraine/index.html,Biden admin imposes harsh sanctions on Russian oil industry to cut off funding for Ukraine war effort,2025-01-10 15:30:00,"The Biden administration on Friday targeted Russia’s energy sector, including its oil industry, with some of its harshest sanctions to date meant to cut off funding for Moscow’s war against Ukraine.
The sweeping moves, taken just over a week before President Joe Biden leaves office, come as President-elect Donald Trump says he is readying to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. They also have the potential to unnerve investors in energy markets.
US senior administration officials said they want to leave Kyiv – and the incoming Trump administration – with the strongest possible hand for potential negotiations. Those officials expressed hope that the next administration would maintain and enforce the sanctions, despite previous skepticism from some Trump officials about the effectiveness of such measures.
The new sanctions against “the Kremlin’s largest and most important source of revenue” hit hundreds of targets, including two of Russia’s largest oil companies: Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.
The sanctions also target nearly 200 oil-carrying vessels, many of which are accused of being part of the so-called “shadow fleet” that works to evade sanctions, as well as oil traders and energy officials. They also go after Russia’s liquified natural gas (LNG) production and export.
“We expect our actions to cost Russia upwards of billions of dollars per month,” a senior administration official said.
The sanctions, introduced in coordination with the United Kingdom, are part of the administration’s broader approach to bolstering Kyiv. The Biden administration on Thursday announced its final tranche of military aid for Ukraine, valued at around $500 million. The Pentagon said Friday that there will be “just under $4 billion” in funding from the Presidential Drawdown Authority that will roll over to the incoming Trump administration for funding aid to Ukraine.
“These sanctions, in addition to the actions we’ve taken over the last several weeks, help put Ukraine in a position in which they have the ability to work with the incoming administration to try and find a just peace,” a second senior administration official said.
On Thursday, Trump reiterated his desire to end the war in Ukraine, saying that Putin “wants to meet, and we’re setting it up.”
“President Putin wants to meet — he’s said that even publicly — and we have to get that war over with. That’s a bloody mess,” he said.
The first senior administration official acknowledged “it’s entirely up to” the Trump team “to determine whether, when and on what terms they might lift any sanctions we’ve put into place.”
Moreover, the strength of the sanctions will depend largely on enforcement, with one official noting that “we have to match every circumvention with a countermeasure, and that will take political will.”
“Russia is going to make every effort to circumvent these sanctions. It’s inevitable,” the first official said.
“But circumvention is not costless. Russia has had a constant need to adapt and reorient its supply chains. That creates inefficiency. It creates uncertainty. It creates complexity. So our sanctions are like pounds of sand into the gears of Russia’s war machine,” they said.
Friday’s measures do not have secondary sanctions against specific countries, officials said. China and India have been top importers of Russian oil throughout the war in Ukraine.
Officials argued that they waited until the waning days of the administration to impose the sanctions in part because of the state of the global oil market and the potential impact on the US economy.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 sparked fears of major supply disruptions from one of the world’s leading producers. Oil prices spiked to as high as $130 a barrel in March 2022, contributing to the inflation crisis across the US economy and pushing gasoline prices to all-time highs.
“During much of this war, global supplies were tight and at risk of falling short of demand,” the first senior administration official explained, noting that would have likely increased revenues to Russia “while raising prices at the gas pump for families in the United States and across the world.”
Now, the official said, both oil markets and the US economy “are in a fundamentally better place.”
The United States is producing more oil than any nation in world history, forcing OPEC to dial back supply. Oil prices have been relatively subdued, in part because of record-shattering US production.
Still, oil prices climbed sharply Friday morning, even before the official sanctions announcement, with some traders blaming rumored sanctions.
US crude jumped 4% to nearly $77 a barrel. Brent crude, the world benchmark, advanced 3.7% to about $80 a barrel.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/10/europe/transnistria-energy-crisis-moldova-russia-explainer-intl/index.html,A Russia-backed breakaway region is fast running out of energy. Here’s what to know,2025-01-10 12:06:29,"In the capital of Transnistria, a self-declared microstate sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine, the festive New Year’s lights have gone dark ahead of schedule. This separatist sliver of Moldova will run out of energy in three weeks, the head of its Russia-backed government has said.
Once proud, go-it-alone and richer than their neighbors in Moldova proper, Transnistrians are now burning wood to keep warm through hours-long blackouts as winter bites.
The crunch began when Moscow stopped pumping natural gas through pipelines in Ukraine to Europe. Transnistrian officials have declared a state of emergency. They say their region is facing “not only an energy crisis, but a humanitarian one.” Analysts say this understates the problem, which has raised questions about the future of the de facto state.
“This is an existential question (for Transnistria),” Vadim Pistrinciuc, director of the Institute for Strategic Initiatives (ISI), a think tank in Moldova, told CNN.
Here’s what you need to know.
How did the crisis start?
For years, Russian gas flowed through Ukraine to Moldova and elsewhere in Europe. The last transit agreement with Kyiv, signed before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, was due to expire on January 1. Ukraine said for months it would not renew the agreement – and made good on its promise.
Some countries prepared for this. Austria said it did its “homework” and now sources gas elsewhere. Hungary and Slovakia have also found alternative, much costlier, supplies.
Transnistria did not. After splitting from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union crumbled, Transnistria has relied entirely on Russian gas – delivered through Ukraine’s pipelines, mostly free of charge – to keep the lights on.
That’s over. With Russia unwilling to send gas via other routes, Transnistria is going dark.
How has Transnistria been affected?
Home to more than 300,000 people – mostly Russian speakers – Transnistria celebrated Orthodox Christmas on Tuesday. The usually festive occasion was interrupted by the region’s self-proclaimed government announcing daily eight-hour power outages.
The government said it took the decision after electricity consumption had jumped fourfold in recent days. With no gas to keep homes warm, residents had turned to electric heaters – putting huge strain on the region’s creaking power grid.
“The system created during the Soviet period… is not coping,” President Vadim Krasnoselsky said at a meeting of the region’s energy council on Monday. He urged residents to use electric heating “selectively.”
Videos posted online show a glimpse of how residents are coping. Transnistrians are cooking meals on electric mini-stoves and burning firewood and coal to heat their homes. Hot water is now supplied on a strict schedule, causing some to boil water in kettles and take showers using buckets.
Some alternative heating methods have proved hazardous. Orthodox Christmas was marked by two cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, one of them fatal.
On Tuesday, a family of four in the city of Bendery, including a 7-year-old child, fell ill due to fumes from a gas water heater. They were treated and released in a stable condition. The following night in the capital, Tiraspol, a woman died while showering in a poorly-ventilated apartment where a chimneyless gas water heater was in use, according to the region’s Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Unable to keep classrooms warm, schools and colleges have extended the winter vacation until January 20, far later than scheduled. Many kindergartens have not reopened after the holidays. The ones that have are burning firewood for heating.
Sergey Obolonik, minister for economic development, said Wednesday that the region’s gas reserves will last for another 24 days.
Has Moldova also been hit?
Yes, but not as badly. Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moldova was almost entirely reliant on Russian gas. But a few months into the war, Russia’s energy giant Gazprom sharply cut gas supplies to the country and hiked its prices, citing unpaid debts.
Moldovan officials were perplexed – and some cried foul, describing the move as an attempt to “blackmail” the country for a pivot towards the West. With winter approaching, Moldova swiftly arranged energy supplies from Europe.
Despite ending gas purchases from Russia, it still bought large amounts of its energy from Transnistria, which uses Russian gas to generate electricity at the Cuciurgan power plant.
Now Russian gas supplies have been cut off, that plant is producing vastly less energy. Moldova has had to buy from emergency European markets – mostly via Romania – at nearly twice the price.
Further costs are on the horizon, too. Moldova’s government in Chisinau, led by the recently re-elected pro-Western President Maia Sandu, has said it will provide support to residents fleeing from the freezing temperatures and energy shortages in Transnistria.
Will Transnistria accept help from Chisinau?
Chisinau has offered to sell gas and energy to Transnistria, although officials in Tiraspol show little sign of accepting the offer.
The main reason is economic. Unlike Moscow, Chisinau is not proposing to send gas for free. After 30 years of abundant, low-cost energy, Transnistrians would now have to pay the same rate as those in Moldova proper.
“It’s a problem of costs for the residents of Transnistria,” Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s former foreign minister, told CNN. “Moldova has been much more prepared for such a situation. Transnistria has not done anything in 30 years to be prepared.”
Another reason is political. After decades of proclaiming its independence from Moldova, to be seen accepting “help” from it would be akin to admitting failure.
Instead, Tiraspol is attempting to pin the crisis on Chisinau. Krasnoselsky has accused Moldova of trying to “strangle” the region and force it to renounce its claims to statehood.
What’s Russia’s role?
Russia could provide gas to Transnistria but is choosing not to. Although it can no longer transit gas through Ukraine, other pipelines are available under the Black Sea via Turkey, albeit at a higher cost than before.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the situation is “critical,” but added that “the decisions of Ukraine and the Moldovan authorities” had “deprived” Transnistria of natural gas.
Peskov said some European countries, including Slovakia, still wanted Russia’s “more competitive” supplies. He also criticized the United States for profiting from the crisis, saying it had boosted its costlier gas exports to Europe.
Russia may also stand to gain from declining to end the energy crisis in Transnistria – whose people it claims to support.
Russia has long worked to destabilize Moldova, most recently in its presidential election in October, which was framed as a choice between Moscow and the West.
Although polls had predicted a comfortable victory for Sandu, she ultimately won re-election by the thinnest of margins. She later said the vote had been marred by an “unprecedented assault” by foreign actors. CNN has previously reported on Russia-backed efforts to sway the result through a vast vote-buying campaign, accusations the Kremlin consistently denied.
Although Sandu clung on in October, Moldova has parliamentary elections later this year. The crisis in Transnistria – which could prompt thousands of residents to flee across the border – provides Russia with an opportunity to sow more chaos in Moldova, Popescu warned.
“Russia doesn’t care much about residents in Transnistria. It has the goal of destabilizing the Moldovan economy, political system and social fabric. It doesn’t care about Transnistrians freezing in winter,” he said.
Why did Ukraine not renew the gas transit agreement?
Ukraine was widely expected to let the agreement lapse, sensing an opportunity to inflict costs on Russia and its allies.
After Russian gas stopped flowing through Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky called the move “one of Moscow’s greatest defeats.” He accused the Kremlin of using energy as a “weapon” with which to blackmail its partners.
Although Ukraine now faces a loss of some $800 million a year in transit fees from Russia, Gazprom stands to lose far more, at up to $5 billion a year in sales, according to Reuters.
Russian officials have responded furiously to the move. Russia’s Embassy in Moldova said Kyiv had “cynically” stopped the flow of gas to “condemn the population of Transnistria to suffering.” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called the decision “bullying and neo-Nazism.”
Pistrinciuc, director of the ISI think tank, said he hoped these narratives did not take hold among Transnistrians. He said the crisis might make some confront what he described as the reality of their situation: “It’s a very isolated region… We hope that they see the impotence of this type of unrecognized state.”","['Christian Edwards', 'Anna Chernova']",en

NATO assumed command and control from the US on Thursday, said Col. Martin O’Donnell, and will help to safeguard logistics nodes in Poland that are needed to continue delivering aid crucial to Ukraine’s war effort against Russia. The move is part of a broader effort that has been in the works for months to shift the burden of helping Ukraine from the US to European countries, amid questions over whether US support would continue under the Trump administration.
NATO allies have been bracing for US support for Ukraine to shrink over the next year. Trump has questioned the value of aid to Ukraine and the US commitment to NATO, and while he has said he wants to end the war he has not yet weighed in on whether his administration will continue providing military assistance to Ukraine.
Ahead of the imminent transfer of power, the US has worked to transition aid to Ukraine from a US-led effort to a NATO-led mechanism in part to “Trump-proof” the assistance, CNN has reported.
“That work is ongoing, with NATO shouldering more and more responsibility every day,” said O’Donnell, a spokesman for NATO’s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.
The Biden administration has tried to leave Ukraine in the strongest possible position as it prepares for the incoming Trump administration, both on the battlefield and in the event of negotiations. On Thursday, the US announced another $500 million military aid package for Ukraine, the final expected package from the outgoing leadership.
Over the past month, NATO has slowly begun taking over responsibilities from the US effort to assist Ukraine, known as Security Assistance Group-Ukraine (SAG-U), which handled the flow of Western weapons and equipment to Kyiv. Air defenses in Poland, now under the command of NATO, are a key part of protecting the logistics hubs that enable the flow of those weapons.
Another critical element in aid to Ukraine has been the US-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), a meeting of approximately 50 countries that have supported Ukraine with weapons and equipment.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin led the Biden administration’s last meeting of the UDCG at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Thursday, challenging the other countries to keep the forum alive. It is not yet clear whether the Trump administration will continue to chair the forum, or whether a European country will have to take over.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was expected to detail the figure at the last meeting of the US-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
The last package comes as the White House prepares to announce another round of sanctions on Russia, expected at the end of this week. US officials have argued they are trying to give Ukraine the greatest leverage possible ahead of possible negotiations to end the war this year. There had been an expectation the White House could impose more sanctions on Russia before the looming inauguration and amid persistent Ukrainian pressure.
The security aid announced Thursday under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) has an estimated value of $500 million and includes missiles for air defense, air-to-ground munitions and equipment for Ukraine’s use of F-16 fighter jets.
Stocks of weaponry and ammunition in Ukraine are stable for now, US officials say, while the US believes there are severe Ukrainian manpower issues. All of the remaining money that has been appropriated by Congress for Ukraine is expected to be provided. That does not mean, however, that all of the Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine will be used by the time President Joe Biden leaves office.
Biden had been set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday in Rome for what was likely to be their final meeting, but the White House announced late Wednesday night that it was canceling the trip to focus on the wildfires raging in California.
The Biden-Zelensky meeting would’ve been just over a month before the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the administration is keen to highlight US support for Ukraine in Biden’s remaining time in office. Administration officials argue that both the US and Ukrainian administrations anticipated that there could be negotiations with Moscow in the first part of 2025 – regardless of who won the US elections – and their goal was to further empower Ukraine ahead of potential talks.
Earlier Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, told Fox News that he hopes to have a “solvable solution” between the two sides within 100 days of Trump taking office.
US officials say the sanctions the US has imposed on Russia have contributed to a significant weakening of the Russian economy – with current soaring inflation and interest rates and Russia’s diminishing ability to compete economically in the long term. The latest sanctions that are expected to be announced, whose targets are unclear, are being discussed – but not coordinated – with incoming Trump officials even though the next administration would be charged with enforcing them.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/08/europe/ukraine-russia-engels-saratov-oil-depot-drone-intl/index.html,Ukraine says it attacked fuel depot serving Russian strategic bombers’ air base,2025-01-08 12:31:49,"Ukrainian drones struck deep inside Russia in an overnight attack targeting an oil facility serving a military airfield in the city of Engels, nearly 400 miles from the border, Ukraine’s military said Wednesday.
Ukrainian officials reported a huge fire at the Kombinat Kristall oil depot, which provides fuel to the Engels-2 military airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia’s strategic bomber fleet is located.
At least two Russian firefighters were killed while responding to the fire, Roman Busargin, governor of Saratov region, said in a post on Telegram Wednesday. Another specialist was hospitalized, Busargin said.
Images geolocated by CNN showed large balls of flames lighting up the night sky and plumes of smoke continuing to billow from the site on Wednesday morning.
“The destruction of the oil depot raises major logistic challenges for the strategic aviation of the Russian occupiers and significantly reduces their ability to strike at peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian objects,” Ukraine’s military said.
Long-range drone strikes have played a prominent role over nearly three years of war between Russia and Ukraine. As land warfare has become more attritional, Kyiv has increasingly taken the battle to the skies and enjoyed considerable success, seeking to disrupt Russian logistics, damage its weapons stockpiles and set its oil facilities ablaze.
Wednesday’s attack is not the first time Ukraine has targeted Saratov, the main city of which lies more than 600 kilometers (375 miles) from the Ukrainian border, although Russian air defenses had mostly thwarted previous attacks.
Busargin confirmed that the cities of Saratov and Engels suffered a “massive” drone attack overnight, which he said had caused damage at an industrial site. Ukraine’s military said this site was the oil depot at the Engels-2 airfield.
Russia’s defense ministry said its air defenses had intercepted 23 Ukrainian drones in the overnight attack, including 11 drones over Saratov and four over the Kursk region – where Ukraine has renewed its counterattack after snatching a large pocket of Russian territory last summer.
The ministry did not say how many Ukrainian drones evaded air defenses in Saratov, but Ukraine’s military reported “numerous explosions” in the region.
Oleksandr Kamyshin, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said the drones used in the long-range attack had been made in Ukraine.
Last year, CNN was granted exclusive access to one of Ukraine’s long-range drone units, which operates under Ukraine’s defense intelligence and has conducted hundreds of attacks on Russian soil since the war began in February 2022.
Meanwhile, Russia fired 64 drones at targets in Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine’s air force. It said it had shot down 41 of the drones and that 22 others did not reach their targets. It did not account for the one outstanding drone in its count.
Later on Wednesday, Zelensky said that at least 13 people were killed in a Russian strike on the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region in southeastern Ukraine. Dozens of others were wounded, he said on Telegram.
The overnight attacks come as both Ukraine and Russia have redoubled their efforts to shift the frontlines, perhaps with a view to the imminent return of Donald Trump to the White House and the prospect of peace talks. Trump has previously said he wants to end this war in a day, without saying how.
Russia’s defense ministry on Monday said it had captured the eastern town of Kurakhove in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, as it circles in on the key strategic city of Pokrovsk. Kyiv has cast doubt on Russia’s claims, however, saying fighting continued in Kurakhove on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched a fresh offensive in Russia’s Kursk region, where it has been holding territory since its shock incursion last summer.

After months of intense fighting, Russia’s Defense Ministry on Monday said its troops had “completely liberated” Kurakhove, a small industrial town that is a stepping stone to the key city of Pokrovsk and wider southern frontlines. But a Ukrainian official has cast doubt on Russia’s claims, saying fighting in the town continued on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Kyiv has renewed its offensive in Kursk, where its troops have been holding territory after launching a shock incursion last summer. Ukraine’s military said on Tuesday that it had conducted a precision strike on a Russian military command post near the town of Belaya.
Despite both sides being drained after nearly three years of war, frontline fighting has ramped up in recent weeks. With Donald Trump set to return to the White House this month – promising to end the war in a day, without saying how – Moscow and Kyiv appear to be making an 11th-hour push to gobble up territory and strengthen their negotiating hands ahead of potential peace talks.
Kurakhove has been pummeled in recent weeks as Russian troops circle in on Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub that, if lost, would hamper Ukraine’s ability to hold onto territory in Donetsk. Kurakhove is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pokrovsk, and is the latest in a string of towns claimed by Russia.
Ukraine’s “Khortytsia” operational and strategic grouping said their troops were countering Russia’s attempts “to exercise their numerical superiority and develop an offensive.” It said Russian troops were fighting in parts of the town.
Viktor Tregubov, spokesperson for Khortytsia, said that fighting had continued Tuesday morning in the western part of Kurakhove and near the town’s thermal power plant.
“Despite reports from Russian forces that the town is under their complete control and captured, we have not confirmed this information,” Tregubov told CNN.
CNN has been unable to verify the claims independently.
Ukrainian military bloggers have shared differing accounts of Russia’s gains and the success of Ukraine’s defensive strategy.
One blogger, Yuriy Butusov, wrote that Kurakhove has been “virtually lost” despite “heroic” efforts by Ukraine’s forces. He said troops were still defending key industrial areas, including the power plant.
Russian state media on Monday said Ukrainian troops had been “pushed back from parts of the premises” of the power plant, citing sources in Russian security structures, but that fighting was still underway. “A lot of work in the industrial zone is still ahead,” the sources were quoted as saying.
Butusov questioned the wisdom of Ukrainian military command’s attempts to defend Kurakhove, saying it risked “repeating the same pattern” as in Soledar, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Vuhledar – cities in eastern Ukraine that eventually fell after weeks or months of resistance to Russia’s “meat-grinder” assaults, during which it inflicted huge losses on Moscow’s troops but sustained high casualties of its own.
Another blogger, Bohdan Miroshnikov, praised Ukrainian troops for performing “miracles” in Kurakhove. “It costs us a lot, but it prevents the enemy from causing more trouble,” the blogger said.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is counterattacking in Kursk, despite efforts by Russian and recently deployed North Korean troops to drive Ukrainian units back across the border. Ukrainian forces struck Russian troops in several locations in Kursk over the weekend, with a senior official saying that Russia is “getting what it deserves.”
Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it had struck Russia’s 810th Separate Marine Brigade in Belaya, southeast of the part of Kursk occupied by Ukrainian troops.
Although Kyiv’s troops quickly advanced through Kursk in the summer – in the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – Russia eventually managed to push the forces back. The lines had been mostly static for weeks before Ukraine’s latest push.
In his daily address Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops were maintaining a “buffer zone” on Russian territory.
“Since the beginning of the Kursk operation, the enemy has already lost over 38,000 troops in this area alone, including approximately 15,000 irrecoverable losses,” he said.
He said the Kursk offensive was important in preventing Russian from redirecting its troops to Donetsk and other regions in eastern and southern Ukraine.","['Maria Kostenko', 'Christian Edwards', 'Nick Paton Walsh', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina']",en

While meeting on Monday with the two surviving flight attendants and families of other crew members that died, President Ilham Aliyev said the preliminary investigation into the crash had confirmed that the plane was hit by Russian air defenses, according to Azerbaijan’s state news agency (AZERTAC).
The airspace above Grozny, the capital city of the southern Russian republic of Chechnya, was only closed after the plane was hit, Aliyev alleged.
Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital Baku to Grozny, but was forced to make an emergency landing in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day. Thirty-eight of the 67 people on board died in the crash.
“I can confidently say that the guilt for the deaths of Azerbaijani citizens in this accident lies with the representatives of the Russian Federation,” Aliyev said. “We demand justice, we demand punishment of the guilty, we demand complete transparency and humane treatment.”
Days after the crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized that the “tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace,” but did not accept responsibility.
Putin said Russia’s air defense systems were active when the plane attempted to land in Grozny, according to the Kremlin, and that the area was being attacked by Ukrainian combat drones.
Aliyev on Monday again accused Russia of a “cover up,” saying the “focus on absurd versions” of the crash has ignited “surprise, regret and rightly indignation” in Azerbaijan.
“If the city of Grozny had taken timely measures to close Russian airspace over its territory, if all the rules of ground services had been observed, and if there had been coordination between the armed forces and civil services of the Russian Federation, then this tragedy would not have happened,” he said.
In a break from protocol, his televised comments were made in Russian rather than Azerbaijani.
Aliyev also praised the flight’s crew for their heroism and bravery, hailing the pilots’ “professionalism” and ability to make an emergency landing to save some of those onboard.
People from Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were on board the plane, which was a Brazilian-made Embraer 190.
Brazil’s air force said Monday its investigators had completed the extraction of data from two black box recorders that were recovered from the crash, Reuters reported. The flight recorders had been sent to Brazil, where international experts were joined by their Azerbaijani counterparts to analyze the devices in a move to ensure transparency and credibility, according to Kazakhstan state news agency.
The data has been sent to the Kazakh authorities investigating the crash, according to Reuters. Kazakhstan’s government is cooperating with Azerbaijan on the investigation.
Separately, Russia’s investigative committee has opened a criminal case in relation to the disaster, the Kremlin said.
Video and images after the plane crashed showed perforations in the plane’s body that look like damage from shrapnel or debris. The cause of the holes has not been confirmed.
“I am sure that in the near future we will learn the initial results, and everything will fall into place. The whole picture of the tragedy that occurred will also become known,” Aliyev said. “Of course, this will be an important moment in the full investigation of the tragedy and the punishment of its perpetrators.”","['Jay Ganglani', 'Hassan Tayir']",en

Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation, an official body, said Ukrainian forces had launched surprise attacks against Russian forces in several locations across Kursk, months after launching its incursion in the region.
In a short Telegram post Sunday, the head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, said: “Kursk region, good news, Russia is getting what it deserves.”
The Ukrainian military first launched an incursion into Kursk in August and has held much of the territory it took, despite efforts by Russian and recently deployed North Korean troops to drive Ukrainian units back across the border.
The Russian defense ministry on Monday claimed that its forces had repelled Kyiv’s counterattack.
The ministry said that Russian units, supported by aviation and artillery, launched a “decisive” response and destroyed Ukraine’s main forces that had gathered near the village of Berdin, some 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the border.
It added that Russian forces “prevented the Ukrainian Armed Forces from breaking through.”
CNN is unable to verify battlefield reports.
The Kursk offensive – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – took Russia and Ukraine’s allies by surprise when it was launched. Kyiv’s troops advanced quickly, though Russia eventually began to push their forces back; the line of control has not changed dramatically in recent months.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address Monday that Ukraine was maintaining a buffer zone in the Kursk region. He said that Kyiv’s troops were “actively destroying” the Russian military, and that since the start of the incursion into Kursk 5 months ago nearly 15,000 Russian troops had been killed.
Zelensky emphasized that by deploying its “strong units” to fight in Kursk region Russia could no longer send them elsewhere to such places as “Donetsk, Sumy, Kharkiv, or Zaporizhzhia regions.”
On Saturday, Zelensky said that in battles near the village of Makhnovka, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean soldiers and Russian paratroopers. A battalion is normally several hundred troops.
Unofficial Russian military blogs, which often provide reliable reporting on the Ukraine conflict, acknowledged the fighting on Sunday. One said that the Ukrainians were pushing north towards Berdin.
“The enemy has thrown reserves into the offensive in Kursk region,” said one blog Sunday.
“For the breakthrough, the AFU covered the area with powerful radio electronic warfare systems, hampering the work of our UAVs (drones),” the blog said. “There are small arms battles, our artillery and tanks are actively working against the enemy.”
A second blog carried a similar account, saying the offensive had begun from the Sudzha area, but the Ukrainians had also landed paratroopers and intensified fighting in other directions.
“In this offensive the enemy uses mine clearance trawls, tanks and other armored vehicles,” the blog said, adding that frosty ground was enabling the attack, but that was not expected to last. It added that Russian bombers were in action.
Ukrainian and Western assessments say that some 11,000 North Korean troops are deployed in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces occupy swathes of territory after staging the cross-border incursion.
A senior Ukrainian officer told CNN that the Russians had begun a heavy bombardment of the town of Sudzha, which the Ukrainians took last August.
Col. Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, press officer for the military commandant’s office in the Kursk region, told CNN there were swarms of drones in the area and constant explosions, with missiles landing directly on the town.
“The enemy is dismantling the city floor by floor, block by block, trying to clear the city before the main assault,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.
He said civilians holed up in a boarding school wanted to leave but Russia had not consented to their transportation. “There are currently approximately 2,000 people there. About 39 people have been killed by air and artillery strikes, and more than 100 have been wounded.”
In eastern Ukraine, the Russian military has reported advances near the town of Kurakhove, a critical area of the battlefield in Donetsk region.
The unofficial Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said that Russian forces had advanced in Kurakhove and Toretsk, and published video of a column of Russian vehicles entering the village of Yelyzavetivka before coming under heavy fire.
A Russian military blog claimed that a special forces detachment had raised the Russian flag on the western outskirts of Kurakhove.
Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to say when Russia would recapture the southern Kursk region after a phone-in question at his year-end news conference last month.
“Our guys are fighting, there is a battle going on right now, and serious battles. It is unclear why, there was no military sense in the Ukrainian Armed Forces entering the Kursk region, or holding on there now as they are doing, throwing their best units there to be slaughtered,” Putin said.
One possible motive behind Kyiv’s decision to enter Russia was to improve its hand ahead of any potential future ceasefire negotiations.
Incoming US President Donald Trump has said he would end the war “in 24 hours,” but not how, and has demurred over future military aid to Ukraine.
Last week, Zelensky said that the North Korean military has been facing severe losses and accused Russia of sending them to the battlefield with “minimal protection.”

Vadim Krasnoselskyi, the president of the Russian-backed separatist sliver on Moldova’s eastern flank, said in a message on Telegram on Friday that “1,500 multi-story apartment buildings have no heating and hot water. Almost 72,000 private households have no gas. One hundred and fifty gas boiler houses have been shut down.”
“Fortunately, our region is rich in wood. There are still reserves,” he added, encouraging residents in rural areas with active stoves to find and burn wood where possible.
The region has been plunged into an energy crisis since New Year’s Day, when Ukraine made good on its promise to halt the transport of Russian gas to Europe through its territory after a key deal with Moscow expired. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the move as “one of Moscow’s greatest defeats.”
The Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said Monday that cold water supply in Transnistria had also been disrupted amid the energy crisis.
“What we see today in the Transnistrian region is that people don’t have electricity for hours, they don’t have heating, most of all, they don’t have access to gas. And starting today they have even interruptions of water supply,” Recean said during an online press briefing.
He blamed Russia for attempting “to create instability in the region” by ceasing natural gas deliveries to Moldova’s left bank, citing unpaid debts, and accused Russia of manipulating the situation “to influence the results of the parliamentary elections in Moldova” that are due in the fall of 2025.
Transnistria – a pro-Russian breakaway territory on the Ukrainian border – split from the rest of Moldova after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. It had been receiving Russian gas via Ukraine until the supply was cut off.
“We cannot avoid rolling blackouts. This is required to protect the system. I am sure that everyone is accepting this stage with understanding,” the Transnistrian President Krasnoselskyi wrote on Telegram on Friday. “The government has developed a schedule, based on which it will be possible to organize everyday life and activity with the least inconvenience.”
Temperatures in the Transnistrian capital Tiraspol were forecast to hover slightly above freezing over the weekend, as a cold snap passes through much of Europe, though the European winter has otherwise been relatively mild so far.
The breakaway region’s parliament urged the Kremlin to reach a new deal with Ukraine over gas last month. Before the expiry of the transit deal with Ukraine, Russia had been supplying Moldova with around 2 billion cubic meters of gas per year, which was pumped through Transnistria, according to Reuters.
Ukraine now faces a loss of some $800 million a year in transit fees from Russia, while Kremlin-owned gas giant Gazprom will lose close to $5 billion in gas sales, the news agency reported.
Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico has meanwhile suggested he could cut electricity supplies to Ukraine and reduce aid to Ukrainian refugees in retaliation for the expiry of the gas transit deal, which he described as “sabotage” by Zelensky.
Europe has in general significantly reduced its reliance on Russian energy since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but parts of the former Eastern Bloc still import gas in large quantities.",['Rob Picheta'],en

Russia’s Izvestia newspaper reported Saturday that its freelance correspondent Alexander Martemyanov died from his injuries after the drone hit the vehicle he was traveling in on the Donetsk-Horlivka highway, in Russian-occupied territory in eastern Ukraine.
Russian authorities and media have blamed Ukraine’s armed forces for the alleged drone attack. CNN cannot independently verify the claims. Ukraine has not yet publicly commented.
Denis Pushilin, the head of the separatist self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), where the incident allegedly took place, said Martemyanov had been returning from a reporting assignment in the city of Horlivka at the time.
Pushilin said two journalists from the state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti and two from the pro-Russian publication Bloknot Donetsk who were in the car with Martemyanov had also been “lightly injured” in the strike and were receiving medical assistance.
Bloknot Donetsk said its journalists had survived by “jumping out of the moving car” and sustained shrapnel wounds, concussions, and bruises.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called the incident “a deliberate murder,” and accused Kyiv of trying to “eliminate” its “ideological opponents.”
She demanded the UN and other international organizations condemn Kyiv for the strike. “All those responsible for the crime against Russian journalists will be identified and will face deserved and inevitable punishment,” she added.
Russia would raise the issue at an upcoming UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine, Izvestia quoted Russia’s First Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy as saying.

In a video message posted to Facebook Thusday, Fico suggested his Smer party could cut its electricity supplies to Ukraine, as well as reducing aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Slovakia exported 2.4 million megawatt hours of electricity to Ukraine in the first 11 months of 2024, Reuters reported, citing data from the country’s grid operator, helping the war-torn country meet shortages caused by Russian bombing of its energy infrastructure.
On New Year’s Day, Ukraine made good on its promise to halt the transport of Russian gas to Europe through its territory after a key deal with Moscow expired. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the move as “one of Moscow’s greatest defeats.”
Fico described the ending of Russian gas flows as “sabotage” by Zelensky and said a Slovak delegation would discuss the situation in Brussels next Tuesday. After that, he said, his ruling coalition would consider retaliation.
“I declare (my Smer-SSD party) are ready to debate and agree in the coalition on halting supplies of electricity and on significant lowering of support for Ukrainian citizens in Slovakia,” Fico said.
“The only alternative for a sovereign Slovakia is renewal of transit or demanding compensation mechanisms that will replace the loss in public finances of nearly 500 million euros.”
Tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava have escalated in recent days, with Fico warning on Wednesday that the halting of Russian gas flows via Ukraine would have a “drastic” impact on the European Union but not on Russia.
Fico had previously argued that the end of the deal would lead to higher gas and electricity prices in Europe.
After putting an end to Russian gas flows to Europe via its territory, Ukraine now faces a loss of some $800 million a year in transit fees from Russia, while Kremlin-owned gas giant Gazprom will lose close to $5 billion in gas sales, according to Reuters.
On December 22, Fico was hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, marking a rare visit to the Kremlin by an EU leader since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Fico’s views on Russia’s war on Ukraine vary greatly from those of the majority of European leaders. Since returning to power in 2023, Fico has ended his country’s military aid to Ukraine and pledged to block Ukraine from joining NATO. He has also been critical of EU sanctions on Russia.",['Sophie Tanno'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/29/europe/ukraine-wartime-cultural-scene-thriving-cmd-intl/index.html,Plays between air raids and songs in shelters: How cultural life is thriving in wartime Ukraine,2024-12-29 05:01:43,"Olha Mesheryakova doesn’t know what the next year will bring for her life in the capital of war-torn Ukraine, for her family or her business. She is confident, however, that in 2025 she will attend a dozen performances in the theaters of Kyiv. The thought gives her a sense of hope.
“This creates a certain expectation, gives a kind of structure, great support at a time when the world around me has gone crazy, and I know exactly what I’m going to do on December 23, for example, because I bought tickets in the summer. Honestly, it gives me hope and faith in the future. It’s some kind of magic,” said Mesheryakova, an entrepreneur.
She is far from alone in her passion for theater. To get tickets to a popular performance, she, along with thousands of other Ukrainians, has to hunt for them months in advance.
On a blacked-out street in the center of Kyiv in mid-December, cars move slowly, as hundreds of people descend on the small, historic building of the Ivan Franko National Academic Drama Theater, located just a few hundred meters below the presidential residence.
Since the theater reopened six months after the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, it has been packed almost every day.
Over that time, the theater itself, its actors and its audience have changed. Its director, Yevhen Nyshchuk, volunteered in the military in 2022, as did many of his colleagues. For example, all three actors who played the main roles in “Three Comrades,” adapted from the post-World War I novel by the German writer Erich Maria Remarque, ended up at the front and were able to return to the stage only a year later.
“Remarque sounded completely different. The reality of the war, which has already affected everyone, has changed us. I felt the audience had changed its perception of the theater, had more appetite for it, for this exchange of energy,” Nyshchuk, also an actor, told CNN.
Nyshchuk felt this altered appreciation for Remarque’s writing so keenly in part because he and his colleagues continued to serve in the Armed Forces. To perform the plays, they received permission from their command to take short leaves.
Since the war began, the Ivan Franko Drama Theater has staged more than 1,500 performances attended by more than half a million spectators. Seventeen plays have been premiered. One of them is “The Witch of Konotop,” a mystical play that explores themes of love and power. Tickets were sold out in minutes for the entire run and many Ukrainians have joined a waitlist for any that become available.
Its director, Ivan Uryvskyi, said he was astonished by the play’s success and the influx of new theater-goers.
“Thousands, tens of thousands of spectators wanting to be at the theater. I can’t find an explanation for this,” he told CNN. Full houses and sold-out performances are typical at most of Kyiv’s theaters, according to their websites and e-ticket services.
Uryvskyi says not all come to the theater to escape from the sad reality of war. It is often the opposite.
“Someone needs to plunge into the present day and understand themselves. And he/she doesn’t need to go to a comedy, they don’t need to be distracted. He needs some serious dialogue. Maybe he needs to cry it out in the theater,” said Urivskyi.
Even if people want to escape from the war, they often cannot, as performances are regularly interrupted by air raid sirens. The audience has to leave the theater building and take shelter at the nearest metro station. If the danger passes within an hour, the performance resumes. Otherwise, the show continues on another day.
Both new plays and those that have been in the theater’s repertoire for years get loud applause from the audience.
“When people applaud for 10 to 20 minutes, they give some part of their applause to the artists for the performance, and looking at each other they give another part to themselves, for the fact that, for example, today everyone survived a missile attack of more than 120 missiles and more than 100 drones, and in the evening they came to the performance, which was not canceled,” Nyshchuk said.
A thriving book scene
The number of bookstores in Ukraine has increased from 200 pre-war to almost 500 now. The largest of them, Sens, opened on Kyiv’s main street in the midst of the war. Offering over 57,000 books, it is crowded at any time of the day and says it had more than half a million customers this year. The store’s event plan is scheduled for months in advance.
For its founder, Oleksiy Erinchak, the launch of such a large-scale project in wartime seemed logical. He began the war as the owner of a small bookstore, opened on the eve of the invasion. It became a volunteer hub in the first months of the conflict and grew so popular that Erinchak started thinking about a new, larger space. Meanwhile, the book market and the needs of the audience had changed due to the impact of the war.
“(A) book is the most convenient way to spend time during the war when it is impossible to predict anything. Many people have switched to the Ukrainian language (from Russian). They are trying to understand what it means to be Ukrainian. And books make it much easier to do that,” Erinchak told CNN.
According to the Ukrainian Book Institute, the number of adult Ukrainians reading books every day has doubled during the war to 16%.
“Maybe it’s just war, or stress, and a person just hides under the covers, under the bed, opens a book and travels to other worlds to get away from it all. Or not traveling to other worlds, but delving deeper to understand why did this happen in our lifetime? And books actually have many answers, and you can feel them, understand them, and feel better,” Erinchak explained.
He argues that the current popularity of books should be maintained in the future.
“Local culture always flourishes during wartime… If people are bringing money to the Ukrainian bookstore, it means that we need to invest this money further in Ukrainian books, in Ukrainian culture,” he said, which in turn will help build resilience to future potential Russian disinformation. “We need to build this foundation in our book and cultural sphere as strongly as possible and build a semantic shield around it, a dome so that it would be much more difficult for others to break in and influence the minds of Ukrainians.”
Songs in the shelters
A few songs before the end of an anniversary concert this fall by one of the most popular Ukrainian bands, Okean Elzy, an air raid was announced in Kyiv.
Part of the audience went down to the subway to take shelter, joined by the band. There, on the subway stairs, the performance resumed, with a speaker instead of a professional sound system, with only guitars – and hundreds of voices singing along to every hit.
“Okean Elzy’s 30th-anniversary concerts are a mirror of our history. We have been together for 30 years: at big concerts and in shelters, in stadiums and in dugouts… But it’s not the place that matters, it’s our togetherness,” the band later posted on their Instagram account.
In the almost three years since the full-scale invasion, Okean Elzy’s frontman Svyatoslav Vakarchuk has performed more than 300 concerts for the military, including at positions near the front lines. In some videos posted on the band’s social media pages, what sounds like artillery fire can be heard while Vakarchuk sings for the military. Okean Elzy has donated almost 280 million UAH ($6.7 million) to the Defence Forces of Ukraine, a spokesperson for the band said.
The Ivan Franko Drama Theater also regularly organizes charity performances and says it has already raised more than $1.2 million for the Armed Forces. Additionally, it offers its stage to troupes that have lost their theaters to Russian occupation or can no longer perform in them due to adverse security conditions.
The vibrant cultural life in cities to the rear contrasts with the situation in the frontline areas of Ukraine, where Russia keeps seizing territory.
Yegor Firsov, a chief sergeant who has been fighting against the Russians since 2022, says he is generally sympathetic to an active cultural life, even if some of those on the front lines may be fighting in “real hell.”
“When it comes to women and children, I and my brothers-in-arms, and everyone, supports it,” he told CNN. “Because people are distracted from stress and in such difficult times they want to experience something genuine, and bookshops and theaters are about the real thing, about life.”
And on those rare days when Firsov manages to come to Kyiv from the front, he too goes to concerts.
“Culture is a part of our lives, it is both about war and partly about leisure, because even we, military men, need mental healing, need to be distracted, to be resilient.”",['Svitlana Vlasova'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/28/asia/russia-air-defenses-azerbaijan-airlines-crash-intl/index.html,Putin apologizes over Azerbaijan Airlines crash as he admits Russian air defenses were active at the time,2024-12-25 00:00:00,"Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has apologized for the fact that an Azerbaijan Airlines flight crashed after entering Russian airspace in Grozny, Chechnya, on Wednesday, but did not say that Russia was responsible.
Putin said Saturday that Russia’s air defense systems were active when the plane attempted to land in Grozny, according to the Kremlin. Unable to reach the airport, the aircraft diverted east, eventually crashing near Aktau, Kazakhstan, killing 38 people on board.
People from Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were on board the plane. Among the survivors were two children.
It is unconfirmed what was behind the incident, but a US official told CNN on Thursday that early indications suggest a Russian anti-aircraft system may have downed the passenger jet. In his comments, Putin did not say that Russian air defenses hit the plane.
Putin “apologized for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace” in a phone call with Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev, the Kremlin said in a statement.
The Kremlin said that the plane “repeatedly attempted to land at the airport in Grozny” but at the same time, the areas of “Grozny, Mozdok and Vladikavkaz were attacked by Ukrainian combat drones, and Russian air defense systems repelled these attacks.”
Russia’s investigative committee has opened a criminal case in relation to the disaster, the statement said.
Video and images of the plane after it crashed show perforations in its body that look similar to damage from shrapnel or debris. The cause of these holes has not been confirmed.
CNN aviation analyst Miles O’Brien explained Thursday that the fact that the metal around the holes is bent inwards shows that there was “an explosion in proximity to the tail of that aircraft.”
The US official that spoke to CNN also said that the holes on the side of the aircraft are consistent with shrapnel damage from an explosion.
Azerbaijan’s Aliyev told Putin that the plane “encountered external physical and technical interference while in Russian airspace, resulting in a complete loss of control,” according to an official presidential statement about Saturday’s call.
Aliyev said that Azerbaija ni authorities had examined holes in the plane’s fuselage, reviewed passenger and crew members’ injuries from “foreign particles penetrating the cabin mid-flight” and heard survivors’ testimonies.
Putin also expressed condolences over the crash in a phone call with the president of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, on Saturday, the Kremlin said.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X that he also spoke to Aliyev on Saturday, and conveyed his condolences regarding the “tragic crash.”
“Russia must provide clear explanations and stop spreading disinformation. Photos and videos clearly show the damage to the aircraft’s fuselage, including punctures and dents, which strongly point to a strike by an air defense missile,” Zelensky said.
Asked by a reporter whether Putin should take responsibility for the crash, US President Joe Biden – who is on vacation in the US Virgin Islands – said that “apparently” the Russian leader had already done so. “Apparently he did, but I haven’t spoken yet with my team,” Biden responded as he left a church in St. Croix, before getting into his awaiting vehicle.
At least five airlines have temporarily suspended flights to areas in Russia since the disaster, including Azerbaijan Airlines, Turkmenistan Airlines, El Al Israel, Flydubai and Qazaq Air.
Most of those airlines cited safety concerns when announcing the suspensions.","['Darya Tarasova', 'Catherine Nicholls', 'Hassan Tayir']",en

Crowds of people surge down the street, traffic blocked by police, many wearing the red and white Georgian flag, or the European Union’s blue flag with a circle of 12 twelve golden stars, like capes.
Every few minutes another group marches by, clutching banners and flags, beating drums, blowing whistles and chanting slogans. There are the “Sportsmen against Violence” (they mean government security force violence); or college students holding a sign “Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite,” and chanting “Sakartvelo!” (the name for Georgia in the Georgian language); or young people with a large white banner challenging the riot police: “Hey, robocop, you are born to be a slave.”
It’s Saturday night, but amidst the boisterous atmosphere, Georgians who have participated in nightly protests for the past month are exhausted, and unsure what tomorrow will bring.
Sunday, at 11 a.m. local time, the parliament, now controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, will inaugurate a new president, Mikheil Kavelashvili, a goateed 53-year-old former professional soccer player, founder of the ultra-right People’s Power party. He was chosen December 14 by the parliament that was elected in late October, a vote in which international observers noted numerous irregularities and government pressure on voters.
But what really ignited recent protests was the November announcement by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze that he was suspending Georgia’s EU membership application process until the end of 2028. Polls show that 80% of Georgians support membership in the EU, and protesters turned out en masse for nightly marches and rallies.
At the curb along Rustaveli Avenue supporters set up coffee stands and ladle out soup to the cold and hungry. On one corner, a guitarist blasts Jimmy Hendrix chords. On another, a jazz singer croons softly. The walls of almost every building along the street are covered with graffiti, almost all of it pro-European Union and anti-Russian. There was so much of it the government sent crews into the streets to cover it up with black spray paint, a menacing reminder of the violence that black-clad and masked security forces have unleashed against scores of protesters.
Friday night, a thunder bolt of news: the United States was sanctioning the founder of the Georgian Dream party, now its honorary chairman, Bidzina Ivanishvili, a multi-billionaire, the richest man in Georgia, an oligarch who allegedly controls the country from behind the scenes.
“Ivanishvili and Georgian Dream’s actions have eroded democratic institutions, enabled human rights abuses, and curbed the exercise of fundamental freedoms in Georgia,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.
“Furthermore, they have derailed Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic future, a future the Georgian people overwhelmingly desire and the Georgian constitution mandates.”
On Rustaveli Avenue, in front of the Parliament building, the cheering crowd played the national anthem of the United States, along with the Georgian national anthem.
A 10-minute walk from the Parliament building stands the pristine white 19th century Orbeliani Palace, the official residence of the president of Georgia. The current president, up until Sunday at least, is the 72-year-old, French-born Salome Zourabichvili. She insists she is the only legitimate president and derides the Georgian Dream’s hand-picked selection of Kavelashvili as an anti-constitutional “farce.”
Legally, the president’s powers are limited, but Zourabichvili has succeeded in an unmanageable task: bringing the country’s fractious political parties together in a coalition. Whether they will remain united is unknown.
Also unknown is what Zourabichvili will do Sunday morning. Late Saturday night she issued a statement: “Greetings, I greet you from the Orbeliani Palace. I am here, I will stay here, and I will spend the night here. Tomorrow, at 10 a.m., I will be waiting for you at the Orbeliani Palace. From here, I will share what tomorrow will bring, what the days ahead will look like, and what the days of victory will hold.”
Will she remain in the presidential palace and risk arrest, as the Georgian Dream prime minister threatened? Will she leave the palace and remain the symbol of resistance? What will the protesters do? Will the movement ignite? Or fizzle?
As I talk with protesters in the streets, several tell me this is a unique moment. President Zourabichvili, they say, is the symbolic head of their movement, but there is no true “leader.”
Even the protests seem not to be led by any one person. They are home-grown, with groups of friends, colleagues or like-minded people joining together almost spontaneously. They are united, they say, by a cause: joining the European Union. Georgia, they say, is part of Europe. For two centuries Russia, and the Soviet Union, tried to control their country. But Georgia remains Georgia, they say, with its own language and proud traditions.",['Jill Dougherty'],en

“Our soldiers managed to take them prisoner. But they were very seriously wounded and could not be resuscitated,” Zelensky said in an address on Friday.
He did not specify how many soldiers had been captured. The soldiers are believed to be the first North Koreans taken as prisoners of war by Ukraine.
South Korea’s spy agency said earlier on Friday that one wounded North Korean soldier, who was captured by Ukraine, had died from his injuries, Yonhap news agency reported. CNN has reached out to South Korea’s National Intelligence Service and Ukrainian authorities for comment.
North Korean troops are believed to have suffered heavy losses while fighting for Moscow in Russia’s western Kursk region, according to US and Ukrainian officials. Ukraine launched its lightning incursion into Kursk in August, forcing Russia to divert troops to counter the threat.
Zelensky said that the North Korean military has been facing severe losses and accused Russia of sending them to the battlefield with “minimal protection.”
“They have a lot of losses. A lot. And we see that the Russian military and North Korean supervisors are not interested in the survival of these Koreans at all,” he said.
Seoul’s spy agency said Friday it received information on the capture “through real-time intelligence sharing with allies,” but did not specify any country by name.
Neither Moscow or Pyongyang have officially acknowledged the presence of North Korean troops in Russia.
US, Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence estimates however, put the number of North Korean soldiers in Russia at between 11,000 to 12,000, some of whom have already engaged in combat operations alongside tens of thousands of Russian forces to assist in recovering parts of Kursk.
Ukraine estimates more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in Kursk, while a senior US official said North Korea has seen “several hundred” casualties – both killed and wounded – in the region since October.
A South Korean lawmaker said about 100 North Korean soldiers are believed to have been killed and almost 1,000 injured since being deployed to Kursk, citing the country’s intelligence agency.
Officials in Kyiv have accused Russia of trying to cover up the involvement of North Korean soldiers on the battlefield.
Earlier this month, the Ukrainian military said documents seized from three North Korean soldiers killed in Kursk were fake military identification documents with Russian names and birthplaces.
Zelensky has said Russia is attempting to conceal the losses of North Korean troops on the battlefield, resorting to extreme tactics to disguise the identity of North Korean soldiers killed in combat.
“Russians are trying… to literally burn the faces of North Korean soldiers killed in battle,” Zelensky said in a statement on X on December 17, alongside a video purportedly showing Russian soldiers setting fire to the bodies of North Korean soldiers.
“There are risks of North Korea sending additional troops and military equipment to the Russian army,” Zelensky said after receiving a report from Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces.
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in which he wrote the two countries will continue to implement the comprehensive strategic partnership treaty they signed in June, which includes a mutual defense pact, Russian and North Korean state media reported.","['Gawon Bae', 'Edward Szekeres']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/27/europe/russia-ukraine-war-drones-alabuga-factory-intl-invs/index.html,Russia is intensifying its air war in Ukraine. A secretive factory is ramping up drone production to fuel the offensive,2024-12-27 05:00:44,"On a Kyiv rooftop in late November, a small group of volunteers in mismatched fatigues keep anxious watch. By day, all are judges in Ukraine’s highest courts, but once a fortnight they come together as a makeshift air defense unit, armed only with a pair of Soviet-era machine guns to shoot down swarms of drones.
It’s “the cheapest way,” said Yuriy Chumak, one of the volunteers and a serving Supreme Court justice, highlighting Ukraine’s reluctance to use expensive, Western-supplied missiles against comparatively low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
Chumak and his comrades shrug off the risk, keeping their spirits up with tea and jokes to while away a 24-hour shift. But it’s clear their work has grown exponentially more dangerous in recent months as Russia has ramped up its drone offensive, terrorizing Ukrainian cities on an almost daily basis.
Over the last six months, Russia’s drone attacks have increased from around 400 in May to more than 2,400 in November, according to a CNN tally of data from Ukraine’s armed forces. There have been at least 1,700 drone strikes so far in December.
As the onslaught escalates, CNN has discovered new details about the expansion of a secretive factory fueling Moscow’s drone war. The plant at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, in Russia’s southern Tatarstan region, has significantly scaled up its production of Iranian-designed attack and surveillance drones, using a range of Chinese components, and recruiting a very young, low-skilled workforce of Russian teenagers and African women, according to CNN’s analysis of associated social media accounts and assessments by Ukrainian defense intelligence sources.
The sources, who spoke to CNN anonymously out of fear for their safety, said that the factory is now also producing thousands of “decoy” drones, designed to exhaust Ukrainian defenses. Satellite imagery analyzed by CNN and experts shows that two additional buildings have been constructed at the site, and security increased.
Neither the Russian Ministry of Defense nor Alabuga have not responded to CNN’s requests for comment about drone production at the factory.
The findings offer a rare window into Russia’s booming defense industry, which is, according to a recent estimate by Germany’s defense minister, outproducing the European Union in terms of weapons and ammunition by a factor of four. That has put Ukraine in a precarious position, at a moment when it is in more urgent need than ever before. Just weeks away from US President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House on a promise to end the war, future American military assistance for Kyiv is in doubt.
After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it began importing Iranian Shahed drones. But by early 2023, Moscow and Tehran had inked a $1.75 billion deal for Russia to make the drones domestically, according to leaked documents provided to CNN by Ukrainian cyber intelligence group InformNapalm.
The Alabuga Special Economic Zone, which lies around 600 miles east of Moscow, was originally set up in 2006 to attract Western companies with generous tax breaks. But, after the war started, several of its major tenants left. Part of the site has significantly expanded since it switched to military production, satellite imagery shows.
Alabuga is now the main plant for producing the Shahed-136 drone – or Geran-2, as Russia refers to it – with an agreement to produce 6,000 units by September 2025, according to the leaked documents. Alabuga appears to have already fulfilled that contract. The factory produced 2,738 Shahed drones in 2023, and more than doubled that number in the first nine months of 2024, producing 5,760 between January and September, according to the Ukrainian defense intelligence sources.
The Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, which has been tracking Alabuga since 2022, believes that the 6,000 drones were manufactured about a year ahead of schedule.
“They’re moving fast and you’re seeing it across the entire military production industries of Russia,” David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector who founded the institute, told CNN. “They themselves are not making the high-tech stuff, they import what they need to do that, but they’re able to boost production of things that are easier to make, and drones fundamentally are not that hard.”
In addition to the Shaheds, it appears that Alabuga has been manufacturing low-tech, “decoy” drones since the summer, the sources in Ukraine’s defense intelligence told CNN. Known as the “Gerbera,” the decoy drones are made of plywood and foam and mimic the Shahed’s distinctive triangular shape.
“The Russian military discovered relatively quickly that Ukrainian air defenses can be quite capable of shooting down the majority of Shaheds,” said Samuel Bendett, an adviser at CNA, a nonprofit research organization based in Virginia, adding that, “Russia needed a weapon, a system that could basically present multitudes of false targets for the Ukrainian defenders.”
Russia is aiming to produce around 10,000 Gerbera drones by the end of 2024, almost double the number of Shaheds, according to the Ukrainian defense intelligence sources. Cost is likely a major factor driving this strategy, given that one Gerbera is estimated to be 10 times less to produce than a Shahed, the sources said.
Chumak said it’s impossible to tell the difference between true Shaheds and the decoys on the radar, but that many of the incoming UAVs appear to be unarmed. “If we see the drone on a map or by our eyes, we try to shoot it down… cheap or expensive,” he told CNN. He estimates if Russia fires 150 drones in a night, only 20 to 30 will be Shaheds.
There’s evidence Russia has started trialing thermobaric warheads, which produce more powerful and destructive blast waves, on the UAVs. At the end of October, the Kyiv Scientific Research Institute for Forensic Expertise revealed they had detected traces of thermobaric munitions, also known as vacuum bombs, on fragments of Shahed drones. “If it hits in a confined space, that is indoors, it has a much higher destructive force there than a fragmentation munition,” chief forensic expert at the Kyiv institute, Oleksiy Stepaniuk said.
With the help of volunteers like Chumak, Ukraine is still putting up a solid defense. Only 5% of Shahed or similar drones hit their targets between August and October, according to Ukraine’s Armed Forces. But as attacks increase in scale, the challenge is growing.
A Ukrainian defense source familiar with the situation told CNN that there have recently been cases when “it was necessary to shoot down drones with advanced anti-aircraft missile systems,” reflecting the quick decisions the military must make on how to use precious resources.
Drone factory expands, increases security
Satellite images taken of Alabuga over the past nine months offer stark proof of the program’s expansion.
In June 2023, the US National Security Council released a satellite image of the complex and identified two buildings as being involved in drone manufacturing. Internal documents obtained by the Institute for Science and International Security confirmed the location and revealed that Alabuga was the main party responsible for the production and supply of Shahed drones to the Russian military.
Between March and September, two new buildings appeared next door to those originally identified by the US, increasing the footprint of the manufacturing site by 55%, according to CNN analysis of satellite imagery.
While it’s unclear what exactly the new buildings are for, they are within the security cordon around the two original structures, suggesting they are part of the same operation, Albright told CNN.
Between June and September, construction began on what appear to be elevated walkways connecting the new and original buildings, which were completed by November, according to satellite imagery and Albright’s research. Construction of another walkway is in progress and looks set to link the original buildings with nearby worker dormitories, one of which was struck in a long-range Ukrainian drone attack in April. Over a dozen people were injured in the strike, Russian state media reported.
Albright and his team also identified mesh on top of all four buildings, which they assess to be “anti-drone” cages designed to shield the facility, indicating a growing concern over safety at the site. “Alabuga inside has never had security,” he said. “And what we saw was the creation of an internal security perimeter… because now it’s a military operation.”
Ukraine’s defense intelligence said on Monday that an Alabuga warehouse storing Shahed drone components worth $16 million was destroyed in a “mysterious fire,” noting that it was a blow to Russia’s “military industrial complex” and underscoring the active nature of the fight.
As Alabuga focuses on ramping up production, another partner appears to be stepping in to help ease sanctions-related supply chain issues: China.
Between September 2023 and June 2024, 34 Chinese companies “cooperated” with Alabuga, signing contracts totaling around 700 million yuan, or over 8 billion rubles ($96 million), sources in Ukrainian defense intelligence told CNN. The sources said those companies supplied parts and materials, production equipment for UAV manufacturing, and one even provided jamming equipment to protect Alabuga against drone attacks.
The Gerbera drone is based on a Chinese prototype from a company called Skywalker Technology, which is also supplying the “kits” to build them, according to the sources. An initial contract for 2,000 kits was signed in May, with Skywalker offering to supply another 8,000 in July, they said.
CNN has reached out to Skywalker Technology for comment but has not received a response.
That Chinese electronics have been found in Russian drones is not a secret, but Beijing maintains it has never provided lethal weapons to any party in the war in Ukraine. In response to CNN’s request for comment on the drones, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson’s office said in a statement that China maintains an “objective and impartial stance on the Ukraine issue,” adding that the country “strictly controls the export of dual-use goods for military and civilian uses.”
US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN that Alabuga’s drones were clearly having an impact on the battlefield in Ukraine, and China’s involvement was a big concern. “We’ve made clear to the Chinese that although they are not providing lethal aid, they are selling components – including drone components,” he said.
The US has already sanctioned two Chinese companies believed to be directly involved in developing and producing long-range attack drones for Russia; dozens more China-based firms have been sanctioned for supplying Russia with dual-use goods and components that can be used to make weapons, including drones.
And China’s role at Alabuga looks set to grow even further. Just a few miles from the site a new transport hub is under construction. “The Deng Xiaoping Logistics Сomplex,” named after China’s late leader, is a direct rail link between Russia and China intended to carry up to 100,000 containers a year, according to a promotional video.
Russian President Vladimir Putin raised it in a meeting with his counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the October BRICS summit. Just over a week later, Alabuga reported the first test-train was ceremonially dispatched to China, carrying 76 containers of Russian agricultural products. “Given the pressure from sanctions and the constantly changing environment,” said one Alabuga official quoted in the official account, “we recognize the need to establish a logistical buffer for industry.”
An acting intelligence officer with Ukraine’s defense intelligence agency, who goes by the call sign “Orest” and could only speak to CNN on the condition of anonymity, said the logistics center was only conceived after Russia’s full-scale invasion. “We understand that such a direct transport connection with China can be directly used to transport deficit components required for the production of UAVs, in particular,” he said.
Ukraine’s sanctions commissioner, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, said that, taken together, it is proof more can be done to curtail the supply chain fueling Alabuga’s breakneck expansion. The United States, United Kingdom and EU have imposed sanctions on the Special Economic Zone, with the US also sanctioning affiliated companies, and individuals in key positions. But Vlasiuk told CNN that Ukraine is going further – targeting an “ecosystem” of several dozen companies involved in various aspects of drone production and would like Ukraine’s allies to do the same.
Vlasiuk said Kyiv has communicated its concerns to the Chinese government, but that Beijing was “not exactly ready for conversations on this topic,” adding that the situation was “unfortunate.”
Recruiting Russian teens and African women
Frontline casualties, and an exodus of fighting-age men have strained Russia’s already limited workforce to a breaking point.
To fill the labor shortage and sustain its expansion, Alabuga has turned to low-skilled workers, employing Russian teenagers at Alabuga Polytechnic, a technical school set up on the site in 2021, and recruiting young, foreign women, most of them from African countries, via an online program called “Alabuga Start.” The factory touts high salaries, technological skills and futuristic facilities, and for Russian men, the chance to avoid national military service – a huge draw in wartime.
“Still thinking of going into 10th grade?” asks a voice-over in a glossy recruitment video, which was posted on Telegram in July. “Join the super-elite program, air navigation and drone programming at Alabuga Polytechnic. And help the Stalin’s Falcons.” The video then cuts from teenagers in a laboratory setting to a military parade. The “Stalin’s Falcons,” named after the elite Russian World War II-era fighter pilots, appears to be a new Russian army drone unit, which Ukrainian defense intelligence sources believe may be directly associated with Alabuga.
Other videos shared on Alabuga Polytechnic’s TikTok and Telegram accounts show off high-tech laboratories, brand-new dormitories and a team-building exercise described as “the biggest military-patriotic paintball tournament in Russia,” where students reenact WWII battles.
Meanwhile, the Alabuga Start program promotes life-changing opportunities. One video shows a young woman polishing what appears to be a drone and then launching it, promising that successful employees can progress to Alabuga Polytechnic.
And there’s more than just career growth on offer. Another video on its website, titled “Work and marriage,” shows a young African woman arriving at Alabuga, meeting a man, and becoming pregnant. Alabuga Start’s “HR specialists” have traveled extensively to African countries, meeting local leaders and potential recruits, and in some cases holding events, according to footage shared on associated social media accounts.
But there is evidence life at Alabuga is nowhere near as utopian as these posts suggest. When it sanctioned Alabuga in February, the US Treasury noted: “SEZ Alabuga has exploited underage students from an affiliated polytechnic university as laborers to assemble these attack UAVs in exploitative conditions.” Russian independent investigative news outlets Protokol and Razvorot published a joint investigation in July 2023 detailing long hours, and tough punishments inflicted on teenagers as young as 15 at the facility.
Albright says the increasing pressures of wartime production, and Alabuga’s own quest for profits haven’t helped. “I think the rapid ramp up in production led to safety and health violations and even the recruitment of underage people.”
Alabuga is now embarking on a new recruitment drive, offering salaries of up to 360,000 rubles (about $3,480) per month for “specialists” – more than four times the average monthly salary in Russia – while continuing to fill their assembly lines with students and migrants, who are paid a starting monthly salary of about 85,000 rubles (about $820), the Ukrainian defense intelligence sources told CNN. Up to 200 more African women will be recruited as part of this latest push, the sources said.
A spokesperson from the US State Department told CNN: “This just shows how the Kremlin is not only desperate, but cruel. The Kremlin has no qualms about pursuing its own aims with no regard to the impact on the people of other sovereign countries or international human rights law.”
Posts on a private Telegram group for parents of first-year Alabuga Polytechnic students also offer revealing insights. Several parents have lamented that some students may not be getting their 10-day New Year holiday (a given for most Russians). Others say they traveled hundreds of miles to visit their children at Alabuga, only to get just a few hours with them.
“Working without holidays and days off is not normal even for adults. Psychologists, please speak up about the burden on the children in terms of physical and psychological health,” one demanded. Another mother went even further: “Alabuga polytechnic is really going to extremes, lots of violations of the law, employment codes etc… This is why my child doesn’t tell me anything, so that I’ll stay silent.”
The same woman also described how her child was called into work at midnight on the weekend, worked until 5:30 a.m. and was called back again at 10:30 a.m. Asked which field her child works in, she responded: “UAV.”
Orest, the Ukrainian defense intelligence officer, told CNN all drone assembly workers exist in a climate of secrecy. “All students involved in the productions of these UAVs live at a separate limited access compound. Once employed they sign NDAs. Their contracts say they produce ‘motorboats.’”
Concerns over safety at the facility grew after the Ukrainian drone strike in April. In the following months, parents in the Telegram group referenced frequent evacuation drills, and guidance to supply students with an “emergency bag” containing important documents, spare clothes and food in case they needed to leave in a hurry.
But little was acknowledged publicly by Alabuga about the growing risks. After the April attack, a video shared on Alabuga’s official social media accounts showed a young female employee from Kenya, saying: “You won’t scare me. Alabuga is a strong place, and we will get through this.”","['Clare Sebastian', 'Vasco Cotovio', 'Allegra Goodwin']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/25/europe/pope-christmas-day-message-ukraine-peace-intl/index.html,Pope calls for ‘lasting peace’ in Ukraine in Christmas Day message,2024-12-25 00:00:00,"Pope Francis has called for a “negotiation” to end the war in Ukraine in a Christmas Day message where he appealed for weapons to be laid down in global conflicts and reconciliation between enemies.
The 88-year-old pontiff’s remarks came hours after a “massive” aerial attack by Russia and follow his consistent push for a negotiated peace settlement to end the war in Ukraine. Months of increased bombardment by Russia has left Ukraine in a precarious position as the war continues into a third winter.
“May the sound of arms be silenced in war-torn Ukraine!” the pope said during his traditional “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the city and to the world”) address and blessing. “May there be the boldness needed to open the door to negotiation and to gestures of dialogue and encounter, in order to achieve a just and lasting peace.”
In the past the pope has even suggested Ukraine should have the “courage of the white flag,” remarks that were criticized by Kyiv, although relations between the Vatican and Ukraine have improved. Ukraine’s President Volodmyr Zelensky met the pope for a third time in October and thanked the Holy See earlier for its help to secure the release of Ukrainian prisoners.
A peace deal to end the Ukraine war has become a more likely prospect following the re-election of President Donald Trump who has pledged to end the conflict, while Zelensky has recently signaled a willingness to enter into negotiations to end the war. While Francis has not laid out a detailed position on what a peace deal would look like in Ukraine, the Holy See’s foreign minister has said the position is that they respect the “territorial integrity of Ukraine.”
Elsewhere in his Christmas message, the pope called for peace across the Middle East, saying the “humanitarian situation is extremely grave” in Gaza.
“I think of the Christian communities in Israel and Palestine, particularly to the dear community in Gaza,” he said. “May there be a ceasefire, may the hostages be released and aid be given to the people worn out by hunger and by war.”
Francis has been more vocal recently about the Israel-Hamas war and has described what had been happening as Gaza “cruelty” and “not war.” He made these remarks in his annual Christmas address to cardinals who lead the church’s central administration in what appeared to be a reference to the Israeli airstrikes on Friday that killed 25 Palestinians in Gaza. And in excerpts of a book published last month, the pontiff called for an investigation into allegations of genocide.
Israel’s assault has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians and injured over 100,000 since the war started, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Israel launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked the country on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.
The Pope also talked about “closeness to the Christian community in Lebanon, especially in the south, and to that in Syria, at this most delicate time” and for “the doors of dialogue and peace be flung open throughout the region, devastated by conflict.” He called attention to the “children who are dying from an outbreak of measles in the Democratic Republic of Congo” and for those in the east of that country, and of Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Mozambique.
“The humanitarian crisis that affects them is caused mainly by armed conflicts and the scourge of terrorism, aggravated by the devastating effects of climate change, resulting in the loss of life and the displacement of millions of people,” he said.
On Christmas Eve, the pope inaugurated the Catholic Church’s jubilee year, an ancient tradition which began with the opening of St Peter Basilica’s “Holy Door,” normally cemented shut. The jubilee year, which dates back to biblical times, centers on forgiveness and pilgrimage and has led to major upheaval central Rome as the Eternal City scrambles to prepare to welcome 35 million visitors over the coming year.
Those who pass through the holy door, and carry out certain spiritual and charitable acts, receive a plenary indulgence, a centuries-old Catholic tradition which relates to the forgiveness of sins and can help release a soul from purgatory.
Francis said he hoped the jubilee to be a moment when the “ideological walls that so often mark political life” are torn down, for the forgiveness of debts of poorer countries and for the Christmas message to inspire political authorities in the “American continent” to promote “social harmony.”
In his Christmas Day address, Francis said the opening of the Holy Door shows that “God’s mercy can do all things” and encourages everyone to be “reconciled with ourselves and able to be reconciled with one another, even our enemies.”
The pope was brought to the balcony overlooking St Peter’s in a wheelchair and delivered his speech while sitting. The jubilee year is likely to test the stamina of the pontiff who decided to lead last Sunday’s Angelus prayer from inside his residence in the Vatican due to cold symptoms. On Thursday, he is due to travel to Rome’s Rebibbia prison to open a holy door as part of the jubilee celebrations, the first time such a portal will be opened in a prison.",['Christopher Lamb'],en

It is the thirteenth time this year Russia has carried out a major attack on Ukraine’s power grid, according to DTEK, the country’s largest energy provider, leaving it in a precarious position while the war grinds into a third winter.
At least one person died in the attacks in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, while six others were injured in Kharkiv – less than 20 miles from the Russian border – Ukraine’s national police said, adding that residential buildings and civilian infrastructure were damaged in the attack. At least seven missile strikes targeted the city, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said.
Half a million households have been left without heating in the Kharkiv region in temperatures of 3 degrees Celsius (37 degrees Fahrenheit). Kyiv has imposed rolling blackouts to stabilize the grid, DTEK said.
Ukrainian forces meanwhile said Wednesday that they attacked a Russian command post overnight in Lgov in the Kursk region, where Kyiv launched a surprise offensive this year.
Four people were killed and five have been hospitalised, including one woman in a serious condition, according to local authorities in the Kursk region.
In Russia’s North Ossetia-Alania, the ministry of defence said an explosion and fire in a shopping center in Vladikavkaz was caused by falling debris from a drone shot down by air defence forces Wednesday morning which killed one person.
Attack comes after Xmas day switch
Prior to 2023, most Ukrainians celebrated Christmas on January 7 under the Julian church calendar, but last year Zelensky signed a law formally changing the date as a way of further distancing the country from the traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church – and bringing it in line with much of the rest of Europe.
Ukraine created its own independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine in 2018, splitting from the Moscow-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). Since then, religious affiliation has increasingly been viewed as a symbol of national loyalty.
The holiday is now celebrated by Ukrainian Orthodox Christians on December 25, and Zelensky said Russia’s intentions were clear.
“Every massive Russian strike requires time for preparation. It is never a spontaneous decision. It is a deliberate choice – not only of targets but also of timing and date,” Zelensky said.
“Today, Putin deliberately chose Christmas for an attack. What could be more inhumane?”
Russia launched more than 70 missiles on Wednesday, including ballistic missiles, and more than 100 attack drones targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, he said, adding more than 50 missiles were shot down along with a “significant” number of drones.
“Unfortunately, there are hits. As of now, there are blackouts in several regions,” he added.
DTEK said the attacks severely damaged equipment at its thermal power plants across the country.
“This year, it is the thirteenth massive attack on the Ukrainian energy sector and the tenth massive attack on the company’s energy facilities,” the company said, adding its thermal power plants have been shelled more than 200 times since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Russia attacked “the energy sector again on a massive scale,” Ukraine’s energy minister German Halushchenko said on his Facebook page. Ukraine’s energy operator imposed emergency blackouts in several parts of the country, the minister added.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha said on X that a Russian missile passed Moldovan and Romanian airspace “reminding that Russia threatens not only Ukraine.”
Maia Sandu, president of the Republic of Moldova said on X: “While our countries celebrate Christmas, Kremlin chooses destruction – targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and violating Moldova’s airspace with a missile, actions that clearly violate international law. Moldova condemns these acts and stands in full solidarity with Ukraine.”
Romanian’s ministry of national defense said they could not confirm that Romanian airspace was crossed.
Poland scrambled fighter jets in response to a Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command.

Ukraine’s special operations forces said in a statement Sunday they had killed three North Korean soldiers in Russia’s western Kursk region and seized their documents.
Their military identification documents “lack all the stamps and photos, the patronymic names are given in the Russian manner, and the place of birth is signed as the Republic of Tuva,” the statement said, referring to a Russian region in southern Siberia bordering Mongolia.
But the signatures on the documents are in Korean, which “indicates the real origin of these soldiers,” the statement added.
“This case once again confirms that Russia is resorting to any means to hide its losses on the battlefield and conceal foreign presence,” the statement said.
US, Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence estimates put the number of North Korean soldiers in Russia between 11,000 to 12,000, some of whom have already engaged in combat operations alongside tens of thousands of Russian forces to assist in recovering parts of Kursk taken in a Ukrainian offensive in August.
The North Korean troops appear to have suffered heavy losses in the region, according to US and Ukrainian officials, as officials in Kyiv accuse Russia of trying to cover up their involvement.
Ukraine estimates more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in Kursk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday.
Previously, a senior US official said North Korea has seen “several hundred” casualties — both killed and wounded — in Kursk since October. A South Korean lawmaker said about 100 North Korean soldiers are believed to have been killed and almost 1,000 injured since being deployed to Kursk, according to the country’s intelligence agency.
Ukraine’s special forces said on December 17 that, in just three days, 50 North Korean soldiers were killed and 47 injured while fighting alongside Russian troops in Kursk.
One Ukrainian unit reported that North Koreans – wearing different uniforms from the Russians – had launched infantry attacks using the “same tactics as 70 years ago,” in an apparent reference to the Korean War, where waves of infantry were used.
Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have ever officially acknowledged the presence of North Korean troops in Russia.
Zelensky has said Russia is attempting to conceal the losses of North Korean troops on the battlefield, resorting to extreme tactics to disguise the identity of North Korean soldiers killed in combat.
“Russians are trying… to literally burn the faces of North Korean soldiers killed in battle,” Zelensky said in a statement on X on December 17, alongside a video purportedly showing Russian soldiers setting fire to the bodies of North Korean soldiers.
Separately, a Ukrainian frontline drone unit posted video on December 15 purporting to show the bodies of more than 20 North Korean soldiers lined up in an icy field. The quality of the video was not good enough to verify their identity.
Lt. Andriі Kovalenko, an official in Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said the Ukrainian unit captured the footage before Russia was able to evacuate the bodies.
“They try to conceal the involvement of North Koreans in specific operations as much as possible. Therefore, they usually put these bodies in a row, then tracked vehicles arrive and take the bodies away,” Kovalenko told Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform.","['Victoria Butenko', 'Nectar Gan']",en

The video, posted to Russian Telegram accounts, shows a man with a muddied face being questioned in a forested area by another man speaking Russian, who appears to hit him twice across the head.
The man, whose hands appear to be tightly bound with silver tape, identifies himself on camera as 32-year-old Oscar Jenkins and says he lives in Australia and Ukraine.
When asked about the reports of a Melbourne man captured by Russia, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters Monday the government was seeking information through the Australian embassy in Moscow.
“This is concerning news, and we’re working through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to provide support, including, for this gentleman, trying to ascertain the details and the facts which are there,” Albanese said.
“We know that the Russians often put out information that isn’t right,” he added. CNN has reached out to DFAT for further comment.
In the video, which CNN has been unable to geolocate, Jenkins appears to have trouble understanding questions put to him in Russian. It is not clear whether he was speaking under duress.
He is asked why he is in Ukraine, to which he responds: “A soldier.”
Speaking in a mix of English, Ukrainian and Russian, he says he is a teacher in China and a student in Australia.
Embassy reopens
A LinkedIn profile under the name Oscar Jenkins suggests he was a student at Melbourne Grammar School before studying biomedical sciences at Monash University in Melbourne. CNN has reached out to both the school and university but has not received a response.
The profile also lists places of employment in China for several years from October 2015, including as a university lecturer in Tianjin. CNN has reached out to several employers listed.
Australia has long supported Ukraine in its fight against Russian forces, contributing more than 1.5 billion Australian dollars ($930 million) since the invasion began in February 2022.
Foreign Minister Penny Wong was in Ukraine last week to announce the reopening of the Australian embassy in Kyiv ahead of the ambassador’s arrival next month.
The embassy was closed by the previous government in 2022 due to “increased risk,” moving temporarily to Poland to avoid Russian strikes.
Foreign fighters have joined the war effort on both sides, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s illegal war grinds on.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/europe/ukraine-refugees-uncertainty-war-intl/index.html,How the lives of 6.8 million Ukrainian refugees remain uncertain,2024-12-23 05:01:42,"She arrived in London with just one suitcase, full of mostly children’s clothes, and her young daughter in tow. Her home engulfed by war, Ukrainian mother Yana Felos found herself in the United Kingdom in April 2022 with no friends, no family and no community.
“I just started a new life from scratch,” recalled Felos, 34, who fled Russia’s full-scale invasion to come live with a host family – strangers at the time – who offered to take in Ukrainian refugees.
After close to three years of war, the situation has flipped. Felos says she has nothing to return to in Ukraine.
Originally from a Russian-speaking area of eastern Ukraine, the war broke up what little community she had left. Her grandmother had temporarily moved to Belarus before the war, then stayed when the invasion happened. Her parents passed away years ago. And some friends from home have gone down a concerning pro-Russian political path, she told CNN in an interview in London.
Felos’ last connection to Ukraine was her husband – but he could not leave and after she was abroad for so long, they recently finalized their divorce.
“He kept saying that the war would be over… wait a little, wait a little. The war will be over soon, and we will be together,” Felos said. But she gave up hope a long time ago that Ukraine would ever be safe enough to raise a family there.
Felos and her daughter are among the 6.8 million Ukrainian refugees who remain abroad, mostly in Europe, their lives mired in uncertainty.
Every day, she thinks about what will happen if the British government doesn’t extend her refugee visa in 2025. “There is no such thing as a backup plan,” she said.
Meanwhile, she has been building a life in London – securing her own apartment and a job teaching English at a lifelong learning center. Post-divorce, she has no intention of returning to Ukraine and wants to focus instead on opportunities to give her 6-year-old daughter Alisa a brighter future.
As communities become more fragmented, and the economy struggles, the Ukrainian government wants to encourage those who fled as refugees, most of them women and children, to return. It’s setting up a Ministry of National Unity tasked with creating programs and incentives to encourage people overseas to come home.
“We can’t pressure, push people to come back. I can give very loud message to Ukrainians who are abroad to come and help, to work in defense industry, to help our soldiers, to pay taxes, to support Ukraine,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an October press conference.
It comes as Ukraine grapples with boosting national morale, among both civilians and troops on the frontlines, many who have been unable to rotate out to have time off.
Last month, Zelensky spoke about the need to end the conflict in 2025, saying, “from our side, we must do everything so that this war ends next year, ends through diplomatic means.” Incoming Trump administration officials in the United States have also been weighing proposals to stop the war.
As it drags on, though, Ukraine appears increasingly concerned about the economic consequences of a hollowed-out population, and the future ramifications of a brain-drain.
“Every month of the ‘hot’ phase of the war leads to more people adapting abroad and more destruction here, so fewer people will return,” said Ella Libanova, an economics professor and director of the Ptoukha Institute for Demography and Social Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.
And in the nearer term, it’s possible that more Ukrainians could leave.
“If things get really bad, we may see another wave of migration after martial law is lifted – men will go to their wives and children,” Libanova told CNN. Under martial law, most men aged 18 to 60 are barred from leaving Ukraine. Military mobilization was expanded this year.
The overall security situation remains difficult, with Ukraine hit by a recent surge in Russian ballistic missile strikes, and drone attacks increasing each month. Russia launched 2,434 drones in November alone.
On one of her return visits to see her former husband in Ukraine, Felos recalls telling her daughter that the sounds of nearby explosions were fireworks.
Russia also continues to bombard Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as winter arrives and residential areas are regularly hit. The Kyiv School of Economics estimates that as of January 2024, almost 250,000 buildings had been damaged and destroyed, including 222,600 private houses and 27,000 apartment buildings. In a significant number of cities, more than half the housing stock has been damaged.
Even so, many Ukrainians are aching to go back.
For some, the life they once built in Ukraine feels too substantial to simply abandon. People saved their whole lives to buy homes, build businesses and get professional qualifications there.
Maryana Voronovych, a volunteer helping Ukrainians resettle in Austria, told CNN that among the new arrivals, “80% of Ukrainian refugees have higher education, university degrees.”
“It’s been called the most professional refugee wave in recent (history),” Voronovych said, adding that most are now underemployed, working “low-paid jobs” that don’t match their capabilities.
For some Ukrainians, the decision to return has less to do with economics or government incentives, and everything to do with the practicalities of everyday life – mothers are waiting for schools to reopen, or for schools operating underground to protect students from Russian attacks to return to normal.
Victoria Rybka, 40, from the city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, spent the first few weeks of the war sheltering in a basement with her two young children, before fleeing with them to Europe. But in Germany, one of her daughters struggled to communicate in school, and her other daughter developed a skin condition, believed to be stress-related.
Just two months later, Rybka decided to return, feeling a pull to return to her job in the police force and to her family.
“I can’t leave my husband. We’ve been through a lot together,” Rybka said.
Kharkiv was eerily empty at the time, with mostly men and elderly people who stayed behind, she said. Only one other mother in their block of flats came back in the early days of war, but more have since trickled home as schools reopened underground.
“Everyone makes their own choice,” she acknowledged. “I made my choice – this is my home.”","['Lauren Kent', 'Maria Kostenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/europe/russias-putin-talks-with-slovakian-pm-latam/index.html,"Russia’s Putin holds talks with Slovakian PM Fico, in a rare visit to Moscow by an EU leader",2024-12-22 00:00:00,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday hosted Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico, in a rare visit to the Kremlin by an EU leader since Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Fico arrived in Russia on a “working visit” and met with Putin one-on-one on Sunday evening, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia’s RIA agency. According to Peskov, the talks were expected to focus on “the international situation” and Russian natural gas deliveries.
Russian natural gas still flows to some European countries, including Slovakia, through Ukraine under a five-year agreement signed before the war that is due to expire at the end of this year. At a summit in Brussels on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told EU leaders that Kyiv has no intention of renewing the deal, something Fico insisted will harm his country’s interests.
Slovakia last month signed a short-term pilot contract to buy natural gas from Azerbaijan, as it prepares for a possible halt to Russian supplies through Ukraine. Earlier this year, it struck a deal to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.
The country can also receive gas through Austrian, Hungarian and Czech networks, enabling imports from Germany among other potential suppliers.
Visits and phone calls from European leaders to Putin have been rare since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, although Hungary’s PM Viktor Orbán visited Russia in July, and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met with the Russian leader just weeks into the full-scale war. Both trips drew condemnation from Kyiv and European leaders.
Orbán, widely seen as having the warmest relations with Putin among EU leaders, has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to assist Kyiv and impose sanctions on Moscow for its actions in Ukraine. He has long argued for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine but without outlining what that might mean for the country’s territorial integrity or future security.
Fico’s views on Russia’s war on Ukraine differ sharply from most other European leaders. The Slovakian PM returned to power last year after his leftist party Smer (Direction) won parliamentary elections on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform. Since then, he has ended his country’s military aid for Ukraine, hit out at EU sanctions on Russia, and vowed to block Ukraine from joining NATO.
Fico has also been a rare senior EU politician to appear on Russian state TV following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. In an interview with the Rossiya-1 channel in October, he contended the West has “prolonged the war” by supporting Ukraine, adding that sanctions against Russia were ineffective. He declared that he was ready to negotiate with Putin.
He also vowed to attend a military parade in Moscow next May that will mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War II. The Kremlin has used the annual “Victory Day” celebrations to tout its battlefield prowess, and Putin hailed Russian troops fighting in Ukraine as “heroes” at this year’s event.",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/20/europe/one-killed-russian-missile-attack-kyiv-intl/index.html,"At least one killed and several embassies damaged in ‘barbaric’ Russian missile barrage on Kyiv, Ukraine says",2024-12-20 11:14:22,"At least one person has been killed and several embassies have been damaged in an early morning Russian missile attack on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv.
The Kyiv City Military Administration confirmed the death in a post on Telegram, adding that 12 others have been injured. Of those injured, five were hospitalized while the rest were treated at the scene.
It comes a day after Russian leader Vladimir Putin challenged Ukraine to a “duel” in his end-of-year conference, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call the Russian leader a “dumbass.”
“Let them propose… some kind of technological experiment – a kind of high-tech duel of the 21st century, let’s say,” Putin said during Thursday’s event in Moscow. Zelensky in response hurled the rude epithet at the Kremlin leader in comments made online.
According to Ukraine’s Air Force Command, Russia fired five ballistic missiles at Kyiv at around 7 a.m. on Friday. Ukrainian air defenses shot down all five missiles. In addition, 40 UAVs were shot down, and another 20 drones did not reach their targets, according to the command. However, falling debris caused damage and injuries in the city center, officials said.
In one district, an office building, road surface and gas pipe were damaged, and five cars caught fire, Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said on Telegram. In another district, a fire broke out at the site of a building under construction.
Several embassies housed in the same building were damaged, according to Ukraine’s foreign ministry, with a spokesperson, Heorhii Tykhyi, calling the attack “barbaric.”
“These are the embassies of Albania, Argentina, Palestine, North Macedonia, Portugal and Montenegro,” Tykhyi told a media briefing. “Windows and doors were smashed in the premises.”
Portugal said the facility suffered light damage and summoned the Russian chargé d’affaires to protest.
Russia’s defense ministry said it launched long-range missiles at Ukrainian military targets on Friday, in response to a Ukrainian attack targeting a chemical plant in Russia’s Rostov region earlier this week. That attack was carried out using American-made ATACMS missiles, the ministry said.
“In response to the actions of the Kyiv regime, supported by Western curators, this morning a group strike with long-range precision weapons was launched against the SBU command post, the Kyiv Luch design bureau, which designs and manufactures Neptune missile systems, Olkha ground-based cruise missiles, and the positions of the Patriot anti-aircraft missile system,” Russia’s Ministry of Defense wrote on Telegram.
“The strike targets were achieved. All objects were hit,” it added.
Zelensky said Friday in response to Russia’s missile attack of Kyiv “more sanctions against Russia are needed.”
“I would also like to thank all of our partners who are responding to this and other Russian attacks by being ready to provide more air defense systems,” the Ukrainian president added.
Elsewhere in Ukraine, the city of Kherson was heavily targeted Friday morning in a shelling attack by Russian forces attempting to advance, according to local military authorities.
Russian strikes on the southern city killed two people and injured a further 10, according to the head of the Kherson region military administration Oleksandr Prokudin.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-news-conference-intl/index.html,Putin says he’s ‘ready’ for potential talks with Trump during year-end news conference,2024-12-19 10:14:12,"Russian President Vladimir Putin put a positive spin on a spate of recent setbacks Thursday, insisting in a marathon news conference that Russia had accomplished its mission in Syria and was winning the war in Ukraine.
And he nodded to the sea change expected in Washington, saying he had not spoken to US President-elect Donald Trump in over four years, but was “ready” for potential talks with him, amid expectation that the new administration in Washington will push for a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine.
Thursday’s event – an annual display of Putin’s mastery of the minutiae of domestic policy as well as of geopolitics – consists of a public Q&A session combined with a public phone-in.
Russia’s war on Ukraine was a major topic, with Putin keen to emphasize Russia’s recent gains in grinding war of attrition.
“You asked what we can offer, or what I can offer to the newly elected President Trump when we meet,” Putin said in response to a question from NBC’s Keir Simmons. “First of all, I don’t know when we will meet. Because he hasn’t said anything about it. I haven’t spoken to him at all in over four years. Of course, I am ready for this at any time, and I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it.”
Asked whether Russia would be in a weaker negotiating position because of recent setbacks in the Middle East and on the battlefield in Ukraine, Putin replied, “You said that this conversation will take place in a situation when I am in some weakened state… And you, and those people who pay your salaries in the US, would very much like Russia to be in a weakened position.
“I adhere to a different point of view. I believe that Russia has become much stronger over the past two or three years. Why? Because we are becoming a truly sovereign country, we are already hardly dependent on anyone.”
Trump has denied having multiple calls with Putin since leaving office, contradicting a report by veteran journalist Bob Woodward in a recent book that the pair had held “maybe as many as seven” conversations since 2021.
In response to a question on how Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine – which in Russia is referred to euphemistically as the “special military operation” – was going, Putin said the “situation is changing dramatically,” as the war approaches its third year.
“Movement is going on along the entire front line, every day.”
He continued: “And as I already said, we are not talking about advancing 100-200-300 meters. Our fighters are taking and returning territory in square kilometers. I want to emphasize - every day.”
His answer comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged in an interview published Wednesday that Ukraine lacks the strength to take back all its territory occupied by Russia.
Russian forces failed to capture the capital Kyiv in the early weeks of the war, but the war in the east of Ukraine has turned into a costly and brutal war of attrition.
Ukrainian forces remain in the southern Kursk region following a surprise incursion launched in August, but have slowly ceded ground to Russian forces there. Asked about Kursk by a caller from the region, Putin declined to commit to stating when Russia would recapture the whole region – but promised it would happen.
“I cannot and do not want to name a specific date when they will push [the Ukrainian Armed Forces out of the Kursk region],” he said.
“Our guys are fighting, there is a battle going on right now, and serious battles. It is unclear why, there was no military sense in the Ukrainian Armed Forces entering the Kursk region, or holding on there now as they are doing, throwing their best units there to be slaughtered. But nevertheless, it is happening.”
Kyiv has said North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian troops there have suffered heavy losses. Earlier this week, a senior US official said North Korea has seen “several hundred” casualties — both killed and wounded — in the Kursk region since sending thousands of forces to Russia in October.
Putin did not mention North Korean troops in his reply to the caller.
‘Assassination attempt’
Also during the conference, Putin mentioned an embarrassing setback for Russia’s powerful security services: the killing of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the man who headed Russia’s nuclear, biological and chemical protections forces, in Moscow on Tuesday morning. Putin condemned the targeted killing as a “terrorist act” by Ukraine.
“As far as the murder of Gen. Kirillov is concerned… You just said - an assassination attempt,” Putin said in response to NBC’s Simmons.
The Russian general was wanted by Ukraine for using chemical weapons. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office has said Britain will not mourn Kirillov, who was killed along with an aide.
“We have never heard from the Western journalistic corps condemnation of such terrorist attacks,” Putin said, claiming without evidence that Ukrainian forces have targeted civilians in Russia’s Kursk region. “But I am grateful to you at least for the fact that you remembered this.”
Again responding to Simmons, Putin said he would enquire about the whereabouts of Austin Tice, the American journalist missing in Syria, confirming for the first time that the ousted Syrian dictator found refuge in Russia after the collapse of his regime.
“I haven’t met with President [Bashar al-]Assad since his arrival in Moscow, but I plan to do so, I will definitely talk to him,” Putin said. Putin appeared to cast doubt on whether Assad could account for Tice.
“But you and I are adults, we understand, right?” Putin said. “12 years ago, a man disappeared in Syria, 12 years ago! We understand what the situation was there 12 years ago, there was active military action, and on both sides. Does President Assad himself know what happened to this American citizen, a journalist who was doing his journalistic duty in a combat zone? Nevertheless, I promise that I will ask this question to those people who control the situation on the ground in Syria today.”
Putin also boasted about the capability of the Oreshnik, a new nuclear-capable ballistic missile that Russia recently fired at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. He repeated an earlier threat to strike Ukraine again with the missile, suggesting that it be fired at Kyiv as a test of Western-supplied air defense equipment.
The annual year-end Q&A with Putin has become something akin to a public ritual in Russia. Social media posts suggest that schools, kindergartens, and public institutions across Russia and occupied territories in Ukraine organized collective viewings of the broadcast. Videos and photos showed educators and students, including young children, gathered in front of screens. Regional governors from regions bordering Ukraine publicly displayed their interest in the event, sharing similar photos on their official Telegram channels.
This year’s conference comes amid mounting economic challenges, ongoing tensions over the war on Ukraine, and uncertainty as Trump prepares to take office in the United States. But Putin remained on message, assuring his domestic audience that Russia, despite setbacks, was prevailing on all fronts.

Zelensky posted an excerpt of those remarks on X, commenting in English: “People are dying, and he thinks it’s ‘interesting’… Dumbass.” He also posted a similar comment in Ukrainian.
Putin appeared to make similarly glib remarks about the war in Ukraine at the beginning of his comments Thursday, intimating that war was making life more interesting.

Pastor Dmytro Bodyu said the Russians kept telling him they knew he was an American spy, specifically, a CIA agent paid by the US government to spread anti-Russian propaganda in occupied Ukraine.
“They said they knew for sure because all Protestant churches and Catholic churches are working with the American secret services, and all their pastors work for the US government, because the Protestant church is not a real church,” Bodyu, the founder of the evangelical Word of Life Church in Melitopol, told CNN.
Fifteen or so armed men, who said they were from the Russian police and FSB spy agency, stormed into Bodyu’s home early on March 19, 2022. They arrested him in front of his terrified wife and son and took him to a local police station where he said they shoved him into a small cell and threatened him with execution.
He was released eight days later, but the threats and harassment continued. Bodyu said he was given an ultimatum: to continue preaching, he’d have to cooperate. His sermons would be subject to censorship and observed by the authorities, and he would have to share personal and potentially compromising information about his parishioners with the Russians.
The pastor said that he refused and was eventually forced to leave the occupied southern Ukrainian city. His congregation was decimated and his church shut down as part of Russia’s brutal crackdown against Ukrainian religious groups that are not affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has jailed dozens of Ukrainian faith leaders in occupied areas, according to Ukrainian prosecutors. After threatening them with lengthy prison sentences, torture and even death, Russian and Russian-installed authorities have forced numerous other priests, pastors and imams into exile.
At the same time, Ukrainian authorities have become increasingly suspicious of anyone with links to the Russian Orthodox Church, arresting and convicting clergymen of spying for Moscow. US embassy officials, including the US ambassador to Ukraine, have urged the Ukrainian government and religious leaders to ensure respect for all individuals’ religious freedom.
CNN spoke to six religious leaders representing different Christian denominations across several currently or formerly occupied Ukrainian cities, including Melitopol, Berdiansk and Kherson, who were detained. They said Russian authorities accused them of being American spies or of spreading propaganda. Three described being physically abused, one of them sexually. All were told their religious affiliations were the reason for their detention.
The crackdown goes beyond people and congregations. Evidence found in liberated areas and seen in satellite images shows Russian forces have destroyed and looted multiple religious sites and desecrated monuments, churches and monasteries across occupied areas. The Centre for Information Resilience, a UK-based nonprofit that documents potential human rights violations, identified some 158 religious sites that were destroyed or damaged in the first two years of the full-scale conflict.
According to international legal experts and Ukrainian prosecutors, Russia’s religious persecutions in Ukraine amount to war crimes.
The Russian Defense Ministry, the government body responsible for the occupied areas of Ukraine, has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the allegations.
Russia’s Crimea playbook
Bohdan Heleta, a priest of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, spent more than 19 months in Russian detention after he and his fellow priest Ivan Levitsky were abducted by masked men with rifles from their parish in Berdiansk on November 16, 2022.
They were held in several detention facilities in Berdiansk before being transferred to the notoriously brutal Horlivka Penal Colony in the occupied Donetsk region where they ended up spending more than a year. They said they were accused of “conducting propaganda” and were repeatedly beaten and kept in solitary confinement. They had their hair and beards shaved off and were interrogated many times, with their tormentors trying to pressure them into cooperating with the Russian intelligence services.
“There were 1,500 to 2,000 people there, in barracks for 200 people each,” Heleta told CNN a few weeks after his release, adding that some had been detained for nearly three years. “Three times a day, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, you had to run through two rows of special forces who would beat you. In the dining hall, when you eat, they also beat you and shock you with electric current.”
Heleta and Levitsky were freed in a prisoner swap in June. Neither was charged or convicted of any crime, which is common for many of the thousands of Ukrainian civilians who have been detained by Russia since the start of the war.
Maksym Vishchyk, a lawyer at Global Rights Compliance, a non-profit that advises the Ukrainian authorities on investigating and prosecuting international crimes, said Heleta’s experiences match those of other priests and religious leaders detained by Russia.
Earlier this year, Ukrainian authorities filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court’s Prosecutor’s Office alleging atrocities perpetrated by Russia against religious communities in Crimea. Vishchyk, who assisted the Ukrainians with the submission, said the evidence points to Russian policies amounting to “at least nine war crimes and seven crimes against humanity,” including depriving a person of fundamental rights based on their religious identity.
And while the submission focused on Crimea, Vishchyk stressed that Russia is carrying out the same abuses across the occupied Ukrainian territories – drawing from the playbook established in the peninsula since 2014 and doubling down.
“In Crimea, it was kind of gradual. In the territories occupied after February 2022, Russian tactics became bloodier and more violent,” he said.
‘Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations’
The repressions against religious groups in Ukraine appear to be part of Moscow’s efforts to “Russify” areas under its control.
“Russia wants to eradicate anything Ukrainian. Remove any reminders of Ukrainian identity or Ukrainian history, and make the occupied territory Russian,” Vishchyk said. “This includes making Russian Orthodoxy the dominant mainstream ideology.”
Freedom of religion is severely restricted in Russia, despite guarantees in the country’s constitution and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s insistence that his country is a “multi-confessional” society. The most recent US State Department report into international religious freedoms said Russia has engaged in “systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.”
While Russia has no official state religion, the law recognizes the “special role” of Orthodoxy in the history and culture of the country. And Putin has long made faith part of his brand, regularly turning to the church for support. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is one of Putin’s staunchest backers and a vocal supporter of the war in Ukraine.
While religion has become a major part of the war, the battle over Orthodoxy started long before the current full-scale conflict. Ukraine created its own independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine in 2018, splitting from the Moscow-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). Since then, religious affiliation has increasingly been viewed as a symbol of national loyalty.
Ukrainian intelligence services have opened criminal proceedings against dozens of priests accused of spreading pro-Russian propaganda. Several have been convicted of high treason, collaboration and aiding the aggressor state and sentenced to years-long jail terms.
The UOC has repeatedly tried to separate itself from Moscow, declaring itself independent in 2022. But an investigation by Ukraine’s State Service for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience concluded the church remains in the Kremlin’s orbit.
Earlier this year, Kyiv ordered churches to cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church or risk being banned, citing security concerns. Human rights groups have criticized the new law as “overly broad,” warning it could have consequences for Ukrainians’ right to religious freedoms. UOC representatives have accused members of the OCU of seizing its churches by force. Putin meanwhile has accused Kyiv of religious persecution.
Priest hooded, stripped naked
Only state-approved religious organizations are allowed to operate in Russia, and officials can ban any group they deem “extremist” and “undesirable.” Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Church of Scientology, Falun Gong, and multiple Protestant and Islamist groups have been targeted or had their activities restricted, with some of their leaders and members detained and prosecuted, according to the State Department report.
The same is now true in occupied Ukraine, where religious groups must apply for an official registration, effectively pledging obedience to the Russian regime. Those that don’t are automatically banned, and their leaders at risk of being accused of extremism.
Serhii Chudynovych, a priest of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, says he was one of those Russia tried to coerce into complying. When Ukraine came under attack, he turned his church in Kherson into a humanitarian center, flying a large Ukrainian flag above the entrance even after Russian troops rolled into the city.
On March 30, 2022, he was detained by a group of masked men in civilian clothes, who told him and his parishioners that they were from the police. Chudynovych told CNN the men took him to a local administrative building where he said they stripped him naked, put a hood over his head, tied his hands behind his back and started beating him. “They twisted my arms and started clicking a gun near my head.”
Speaking to CNN more than two years later, Chudynovych was still struggling to recover from the ordeal. He said the interrogators were pressuring him into cooperating and revealing the details of Ukrainian resistance groups in Kherson, threatening his wife and children.
“They gave me a baton to touch and said that they were going to shove this baton in my a***. When they pressed it against my anus and started to push it in, one of them said: ‘Will you sign a document that you agree to work for us?’” he told CNN.
A few days after he was released, Chudynovych managed to escape from Kherson to Bashtanka, a town still under Ukrainian control, where he told officials he was forced to sign a document under pressure.
The Kherson Prosecutor’s Office confirmed Chudynovych’s account of what happened to CNN, saying he is officially considered a victim of Russian torture.
‘American spies’
Moscow has been cracking down on all non-Russian churches in occupied Ukraine, but Protestant and Evangelical groups have often been among the first to be banned. Many have links with American congregations and US-based Ukrainian and Russian diaspora.
Bodyu, who is a dual citizen of Ukraine and the United States, said Russia’s persecution of Protestants and Evangelicals goes way back.
“If you had contact with churches outside of Soviet Union, you were (considered) a spy. That’s what they believe and there is no point in trying to explain that it’s not that way,” he told CNN, adding that when he denied being a spy, the FSB officials who interrogated him suggested the US was taking advantage of him without his knowledge.
The persecution of Evangelical Protestants has hit close to home for some in the US – including House Speaker Mike Johnson, himself an Evangelical, who was successfully lobbied by, among others, Evangelical groups over US funding for Ukraine.
Reverend Mykhailo Brytsyn, head of the Grace Church, once a 600-strong Evangelical congregation in Melitopol, told CNN he was also accused of working for the US when detained by Russian officials.
“They said we were like cancer, they called us sectarians and said we were all American spies,” he said.
“They wanted us to take their side. They were preparing for a referendum (on joining Russia) and they tried to blackmail us. They said we would be allowed to continue as a church if we took their side. And we said no,” he added.
When Brytsyn refused, the Russian authorities closed the church down and gave him a warning: leave Melitopol or be taken away by force to the occupied capital city of Donetsk region.
No more prayers
Religious Ukrainians living under Russian occupation are facing the same choice as faith leaders: switch allegiance and join one of the Russian-approved churches, leave or go underground.
One man living in an occupied area of Ukraine told CNN he and others from his Evangelical church were determined to keep praying together after Russian troops invaded their city.
When the Russians took over their building, the congregation moved elsewhere, he said. When the occupying authorities began to impose restrictions on sermons, they started a home prayer group. “We prayed for Ukraine at the group meetings. And then the prayer leader was arrested,” he said. “So now there are no more prayers like that.”
CNN spoke with the man through his pastor, who was forced to leave the city. CNN is not publishing the man’s name or naming his city because of the dangers of speaking out. The whereabouts of the prayer group’s leader are still unknown, the pastor said. Several priests and other religious leaders who have stayed in occupied areas and continued preaching have been sentenced to years in prison by Russian authorities.
Grace Church in Melitopol was allowed to continue holding services for months after the occupation. But over the summer of 2022, churches in the city started being shut down and priests detained.
Ihor Ivashchuk, who was a pastor at Grace Church in Melitopol with Brystsyn, was conducting a Sunday service on September 11, 2022, when some 15 to 20 armed and masked people came in and ushered everyone into the back of the church. He said they searched the building and fingerprinted about 200 people, including many elderly parishioners.
While most people were let go, Ivashchuk said he was held for many hours, watching helplessly as the masked men ransacked the church.
“They kept asking me who controls us, they couldn’t understand that a church can be independent,” Ivashchuk told CNN in an interview in Kyiv. “They kept saying we are working for the Americans, that the Americans give us money and brainwash us and pay us to oppose Russia.”
The Grace Church, which was built by the congregation more than a century ago, was seized and turned into an administrative center by the Russian-installed authorities.
Both Brytsyn and Ivashchuk were forced to leave the city. Many of their parishioners have also left and are now dotted around Ukraine and the world. Those who remain worship in secret, only occasionally keeping in touch. It’s too dangerous for them to even try to log into the regular prayer meetings Brytsyn and Ivashchuk hold online.
Ivashchuk and his family are now living in a small flat in a Kyiv suburb, where he holds regular prayer meetings for the church members who also found refuge there, huddled around a dining table adorned with ceremonial wine and bread for communion.
“I could not imagine it would be possible to keep going. But you can have a church anywhere – even if it’s a bit improvised,” the pastor said.
Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, like other foreign religious groups in Russia, have had their activities restricted under anti-terror legislation, not banned outright.

Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, who headed Russia’s radiological, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a remotely detonated bomb planted in an electric scooter outside his apartment building.
The blast came a day after Ukrainian prosecutors indicted Kirillov in absentia for Russia’s use of banned chemical weapons during its invasion of Ukraine. A source with knowledge of the operation later told CNN that Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, was behind the attack.
Russia’s Investigative Committee said the 29-year-old Uzbek suspect was recruited by the SBU and acting on its instructions. It claimed that the suspect had been offered a reward of $100,000 in cash and the chance to flee and live in a European country.
“The detainee received a homemade explosive device and placed it on an electric scooter which he parked at the entrance to the residential building where Igor Kirillov lived,” the committee said.
The suspect had rented a car and fitted it with a surveillance camera to monitor Kirillov’s residence, it added. The footage was monitored by the attack’s organizers in Ukraine’s eastern city of Dnipro, it said, who remotely detonated the bomb when they saw Kirillov and his assistant leave the building on Ryazansky Street early Tuesday morning.
Kirillov, who was 54, was the most senior military official known to be killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A source in Ukraine’s SBU told CNN that Kirillov’s “inglorious end awaits all those who kill Ukrainians” and that “retribution for war crimes is inevitable.”
Kirillov’s assassination struck not only at the core of Russia’s military, but close to the heart of the nation’s capital, just 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the Kremlin. His death marked the fourth killing of key military figures on Russian soil in the last two months alone.
Although Kirillov’s death will likely not significantly hamper Russia’s war effort, it is a measure of the urgency with which Ukraine is trying to wrest pack the initiative in the nearly three-year-old war by any means possible, as the clock ticks down to Donald Trump’s return to the White House and Russia continues to advance on the eastern front.
Ukraine’s killing of Kirillov will likely have a chilling effect among Russia’s elite, according to Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
“What’s most significant about this was that it takes place at an unprecedented level of seniority,” Gould-Davies told CNN. “This will deeply disconcert other senior elite, including military figures, that they can, in the capital itself, be killed like this.”
Russian state media identified the suspect as Akhmad Kurbanov and published a video of him – recorded by Russia’s spy agency, the FSB – seeming to confess to planting the bomb that killed Kirillov. It was not clear whether the individual was speaking under duress.
The Kremlin has published similar videos before. Following the attack in March on Crocus City Hall in Moscow, when gunmen stormed a concert venue in Russia’s worst terror attack in decades, Russian authorities published videos of suspects – also from Central Asia – being hunted down and beaten by security forces. They later appeared in court displaying injuries to their faces and bodies.
The suspect’s Uzbek citizenship could spark a renewed backlash against Central Asian immigrants in Russia, as seen after the Crocus City Hall attack carried out by men from Tajikistan. Russia relies heavily on Central Asian immigrants to plug gaps in its workforce, strained by the war in Ukraine.
In a press briefing Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Kirillov’s assassination shows Ukraine “does not shy away from using terrorist methods.”
A source in Ukraine’s SBU told CNN on Tuesday that Kirillov “was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical substances against the Ukrainian military.”
A day before his killing, the SBU said that, on Kirillov’s orders, Russia had used more than 4,800 cases of chemical munitions since the war began. CNN has previously reported on Russia’s use of tear gas as a weapon in Ukraine.
Before his death, the United States had sanctioned Kirillov’s government entity for its alleged use of the chemical weapon chloropicrin against troops in Ukraine.
Chloropicrin – which affects the eyes, skin, throat and lungs – was manufactured for use as a tear gas during the trench warfare of World War I. It was banned in 1993 under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), to which Russia is a signatory.
The United Kingdom also sanctioned Kirillov in October for the “deployment of barbaric chemical weapons” in Ukraine.","['Anna Chernova', 'Christian Edwards', 'Edward Szekeres']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/europe/russia-bomb-kills-nuclear-protection-chief-intl-hnk/index.html,Key Russian general killed in Moscow bomb blast claimed by Ukraine,2024-12-17 00:00:00,"A top Russian general accused of using chemical weapons on the battlefields in Ukraine was killed after a bomb went off in Moscow early Tuesday, Russian investigators said, in an attack swiftly claimed by Kyiv.
Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, who headed Russia’s radiological, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a remotely detonated bomb planted in an electric scooter outside an apartment building some 7 kilometers (4 miles) southeast of the Kremlin, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee.
The blast came a day after Ukrainian prosecutors sentenced Kirillov in absentia for Russia’s use of banned chemical weapons during its invasion. A source with knowledge of the operation later told CNN that Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, was behind the attack.
“Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical substances against the Ukrainian military,” the source told CNN. “Such an inglorious end awaits all those who kill Ukrainians. Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.”
Kirillov, who was 54, is the most senior military official known to be killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. His assistant, named in Russian media as Ilya Polikarpov, was also killed in the blast on Ryazansky Street.
A video – obtained by CNN from a source with knowledge of the operation – showed the moments before the two men were killed in the explosion. The outline of what appears to be a scooter can be seen to the right of the door of the residential building. As the two men step outside and walk towards a car, the bomb detonates and the screen flashes white.
The bomb packed explosive power amounting to some 300 grams of TNT, Russian state news agency TASS reported. A CNN team on the ground later saw blast marks at the entrance to a residential building, cordoned off by investigators.
Russia’s Investigative Committee has launched a probe into the attack, calling it a “terrorist act.”
Ukraine’s SBU on Monday said that more than 4,800 cases of Russian use of chemical munitions had been recorded on Kirillov’s orders since the war began – particularly grenades equipped with irritant chemical agents.
CNN has previously reported on Russia’s use of tear gas as a weapon in Ukraine.
Before his death, the United States had sanctioned Kirillov’s government entity for its alleged use of the chemical weapon chloropicrin against troops in Ukraine.
Chloropicrin – which affects the eyes, skin, throat and lungs – was manufactured for use as a tear gas during the trench warfare of World War I. It was banned in 1993 under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), to which Russia is a signatory.
The US State Department said in May that Russia used such weapons “to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield.”
The United Kingdom also sanctioned Kirillov in October for the “deployment of barbaric chemical weapons” in Ukraine.
Over nearly three years of war, Kirillov had routinely made unfounded claims about Ukraine’s alleged use of chemical weapons. The UK accused Kirillov of acting as a “significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation.”
In October 2022 – when Ukraine began to liberate territories in Kherson and elsewhere, delivering a major setback to Russia’s invasion – Kirillov made unfounded accusations that Ukraine was planning to detonate a “dirty bomb,” dispersing radioactive matter on its own territory. “This work is in its final stage,” he said.
In November this year, he claimed that one of the key aims of Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region was to seize the Kursk nuclear power plant.
Kirillov’s assassination is the latest in a series of targeted attacks on Russian military personnel. Last month, a senior Black Sea Fleet officer Valery Trankovsky was killed in a car bombing in occupied Crimea. The assassination was carried out by Ukraine’s security service, a source in the agency told CNN.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to comment publicly, however many Russian officials have responded furiously to Kirillov’s death.
Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council launched a scathing attack of Ukraine’s military and political leadership on Tuesday, saying: “Law enforcement agencies must find the killers in Russia and everything must be done to destroy the perpetrators who are in Kyiv.”
Konstantin Kosacehv, a senator at the Federation Council and chair of its Foreign Relations Committee, said he was shocked by the “irreparable loss” of Kirillov.
“The murderers will be punished. Without a doubt and without mercy,” he wrote on Telegram.
Andrey Kartapolov, a member of the State Duma, said those involved in Kirillov’s murder “will be found and punished.”
Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, said Kirillov had been “systematically exposing the crimes” of the West for many years, citing a number of conspiracy theories, including “the deadly activities of American biolabs in Ukraine,” which has been consistently debunked.
Zakharova also took a swipe at the West, without naming any specific countries, saying in a Tuesday Telegram post: “All those who welcome terrorist attacks or deliberately keep their silence are accomplices…the silence of the UN Secretariat is an obvious sign of corruption.”
Mark Galeotti, a leading Russia analyst, said that although Kirillov’s assassination is another “embarrassment” to the Kremlin’s security forces, it will not have a major effect on its war effort.
“Without him there, someone else just moves up. That’s the nature of the chain of command,” Galeotti told CNN.
However, Ukraine’s recent targeting of senior military officials represents a change in strategy designed to unsettle Russia’s elites, he said.
“In and of itself, this is not going to end the war, but it does speak to the fact that there is a significant faction – particularly the Russian officer corps – that isn’t very happy with the war,” he said. Ukraine’s attacks “send a message” that supporting the invasion bears a price.","['Nectar Gan', 'Christian Edwards', 'Darya Tarasova']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/europe/north-koreans-kursk-losses-intl/index.html,Ukraine says North Koreans took heavy casualties during weekend attack in Kursk region,2024-12-16 14:36:46,"Ukraine said on Monday that North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian troops suffered heavy losses during fighting at the weekend in the Russian region of Kursk.
North Korean units that arrived in Kursk last month were involved in assaults at the weekend near three villages, according to Ukraine’s defense intelligence service.
It added that some 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting and three had gone missing during clashes near the villages of Plekhovo, Vorozhba and Martynovka close to the border.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed Monday that North Korean soldiers had suffered casualties in the Kursk region.
“We do assess that North Korean soldiers have engaged in combat in Kursk, with Russia, alongside Russian forces,” Ryder said. “We do have indications that they have suffered casualties, both killed and wounded.”
Ryder declined to provide specifics on the number of casualties, but said they have been integrated into Russian units and are primarily being used “in an infantry role.” They began actively fighting alongside Russia a little over a week ago, he said.
“As we’ve said all along, those forces are legitimate military targets for the Ukrainians given that they are engaged in active combat ops,” he added.
Separately, a Ukrainian frontline drone unit posted video on Sunday purporting to show the bodies of more than 20 North Korean soldiers lined up in an icy field. The quality of the video was not good enough to verify their identity.
Other drone video geolocated by CNN close to Plekhovo showed soldiers appearing to retreat over the weekend, pulling some casualties on sleds, but it was unclear whether they were Russian or Korean.
One Ukrainian unit reported that Koreans – wearing different uniforms from the Russians – had launched infantry attacks using the “same tactics as 70 years ago,” in an apparent reference to the Korean War, where waves of infantry were used.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last month that North Korean troops deployed to Kursk had been involved in combat, adding that clashes had resulted in fatalities.
Since the beginning of December, North Korean troops appear to have been playing a more prominent role on the front lines in Kursk, especially as infantry.
Ukraine estimates that about 12,000 North Korean soldiers are in the region trying to assist Russian units in recovering parts of Kursk taken in a Ukrainian offensive in August. The Pentagon also believes there are roughly 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia.
The fighting around Plekhovo began earlier this month as Russian units tried to push Ukrainian forces back toward the border, some four kilometers (2.5 miles) away.
A Ukrainian military blogger, Yuriy Butusov, said on Facebook that a major assault had been repelled on Saturday.
Butusov said that North Korean infantry was backed by “massive fire support” from Russian units, as well as electronic warfare against Ukrainian drones.
“Despite the losses, the enemy assault groups continued to advance, never stopping even under precision fire and shelling.”
“The enemy managed to reach the Ukrainian positions due to their good physical training, fast movement, and ignorance of their own losses; no evacuation of the wounded and dead was carried out during the assault,” Butusov commented, adding that “our troops launched several successful counterattacks to restore the situation.”
CNN cannot verify his account of the battle but it appears to match video evidence and is consistent with official Ukrainian accounts.
It is unclear which side – if either – now holds the village of Plekhovo.

General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy would take over as head of the operational and tactical group, replacing General Oleksandr Lutsenko, the official told CNN.
The move comes after Lutsenko faced heavy criticism for failing to stop recent Russian advances on the key city of Pokrovsk.
Russian forces have been spotted just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the city, according to Ukrainian mapping service DeepState.
Pokrovsk has been the site of some of the fiercest battles on the eastern front for months, as Russia attempts to close in on the city.
Lying around 11 miles from Ukraine’s Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, it is a strategic target for Moscow.
Nearby, Russia claims to be making progress toward this goal. The country’s defense ministry said Sunday that its troops had successfully captured two villages in the Donetsk region, as they advance towards Pokrovsk.
The settlements of Veseliy Hai and Pushkino were “liberated” as a result of “active offensive action,” the ministry said. The Ukrainian name for the village of Pushkino is Chumatske. Ukrainian authorities have not commented on Russia’s claims.
The fall of Pokrovsk to Russian forces would mark the largest setback for Ukraine in months and compound Ukraine’s struggles to get off the backfoot while Russian troops pile severe pressure on the eastern front lines.
Losing it would also add to the anxiety Ukraine’s military faces over the looming Donald Trump presidency in the United States, which has raised the risk that military aid from Kyiv’s largest source could dry up as the grinding conflict approaches its fourth year.
Elsewhere in the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that Moscow’s forces had begun to deploy a “significant” number of North Korean soldiers in its effort to drive Ukraine’s army out of Russia’s Kursk region.
Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August and still retains some settlements there.
“Today, there is already preliminary evidence that the Russians have begun to use soldiers from North Korea in assaults – a significant number of them,” Zelensky said.
“The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region,” Zelensky said, adding there had already been “noticeable” losses among these soldiers.
He added that Ukraine had information that North Korean soldiers may be being used along other parts of the front line.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/europe/georgia-president-vote-mikheil-kavelashvili-intl/index.html,Georgian government votes in far-right former soccer player as president,2024-12-14 00:00:00,"Georgian lawmakers voted in a far-right former soccer star as the country’s next president on Saturday, deepening tensions between the pro-Russian government and pro-Western opposition amid mounting popular anger over the former’s decision to halt European Union accession talks.
Mikheil Kavelashvili, 53, is a former MP for the ruling Georgian Dream party and played for the English soccer team Manchester City during the 1990s. He was the only candidate in the running.
For the first time, the president was chosen not by a national election, but in parliament by a direct ballot of a 300-member electoral college made up of MPs and representatives of local government. Because the four main opposition groups have boycotted parliament since October’s disputed election, Kavelashvili was a shoo-in to win.
In total there were 225 electors present for the vote, and 224 voted for Kavelashvili, who was the only candidate nominated, Reuters reported. He will be inaugurated on December 29, the news agency said. Georgian presidents hold largely ceremonial powers.
Kavelashvili is a hardline critic of the West and his upcoming presidency will no doubt exacerbate divisions between pro-Kremlin forces and pro-EU protesters, many of whom who have camped out in Tbilisi for the past 16 nights following the government’s decision to halt talks on joining the EU.
Tensions have been brewing for months in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people, where critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of following increasingly authoritarian, pro-Russia policies in a turn away from the West that has tempered hopes for Georgia’s long-promised path to EU membership.
Georgia’s Prime Minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, congratulated Kavelashvili at a briefing following the vote, while also describing the outgoing president, Salome Zourabichvili, as an “agent” of unspecified foreign powers, according to Reuters.
Meanwhile, Zourabichvili, a pro-Western figure who has joined the opposition protesters, said the presidential vote made “a mockery of democracy.” Before the vote, she vowed to remain in office despite the result, insisting she holds the only legitimate institution left in Georgia.
“I’m here and will remain – standing together with everyone!” Zourabichvili said late Friday.
It is not clear how Georgian Dream will respond if Zourabichvili refuses to leave office. In an interview with CNN in October, Zourabichvili downplayed fears about her safety, saying her future “is not as important as the future of Georgia.”
Critics have questioned Kavelashvili’s competence for the role, pointing to his background in sport rather than politics. He entered politics in 2016 after he was disqualified from seeking the leadership of the Georgian football federation because he has no higher education.
Natalie Sabanadze, Georgia’s former ambassador to the EU, told CNN that Kavelashvili is “absolutely not qualified” and that his selection was taken by many Georgians as “an insult to the country.”
“This was not just a nomination of a puppet who obviously cannot think for himself, but I think it was also a signal to Europe that… we’ll have a president which is completely opposed to the Western values,” said Sabanadze.
Georgia has slid into crisis since a disputed election in October. Georgian Dream – already 12 years in office – claimed victory, but observers say the vote was neither free nor fair. The European Parliament has called for a rerun.
Despite claiming earlier that his party was committed to joining the EU, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced on November 28 that his government would suspend accession talks with the EU, which some 80% of Georgians support joining.
Meanwhile, Georgia’s relations with the EU have deteriorated sharply in recent months as Brussels has alleged that the government had resorted to authoritarian measures and adopted pro-Russian stances.
Pro-EU Georgian citizens have demonstrated outside the parliament building in Tbilisi every night since November 28, despite police and masked “special forces” meting out a catalogue of violence against dozens of protesters. CNN asked the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs for comment on the alleged brutality by the masked forces but did not receive a response.
Georgia’s interior ministry has said that more than 150 officers have been injured during the protests, Reuters reported.
Early Saturday, protesters took to the streets for a 17th day. Some were seen kicking soccer balls, seeming to mock the expected appointment of Kavelashvili.","['Christian Edwards', 'Sophie Tanno']",en

“The enemy continues its terror. Once again, the energy sector across Ukraine is under massive attack,” Ukrainian energy minister German Halushchenko said on his official Facebook page.
The extent of the damage had yet to be clarified, he said, while urging people to remain in shelters.
Streets in the capital Kyiv remained largely empty Friday morning as Ukraine’s air force warned of the threat of ballistic and cruise missiles potentially targeting parts of the country.
Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s energy grid operator, said power facilities in several regions were damaged and it was introducing emergency power outages across the country. Russia has launched 12 “massive” attacks on Ukraine’s power system so far this year, Ukrenergo said.
Moscow’s forces have intensified bombardments of Ukraine in recent months, leaving the country in a precarious position as the war grinds into its third winter.
Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to strike Ukraine again with a new nuclear-capable ballistic missile following a widespread attack on critical energy infrastructure that left more than a million households in Ukraine without power.
Russia’s latest assault comes after Moscow vowed on Thursday to respond to a Ukrainian attack on a city in southwest Russia, which Russia claimed involved six US-made ATACMS ballistic missiles.
Ukraine acknowledged making “tangible hits on Russian targets” Wednesday, including military and energy facilities, but has not said what type of missiles were used.
Meanwhile, Russia continues its ground assault on the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, advancing in the areas surrounding Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, according to reports from the ground and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank.
The Russian defense ministry claimed on Friday that it had captured Zarya village, to the south of the key eastern city of Pokrovsk.
Russian forces are just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the outskirts of Pokrovsk after making advances Wednesday, the Ukrainian mapping service DeepState said earlier this week.
“The losses of the Russian occupiers in the Pokrovsk direction are consistently high, especially in manpower,” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Friday. He also acknowledged that “for several months now, the Pokrovsk direction has been one of the most difficult in the context of the confrontation with the Russian occupiers.”
NATO calls for shift to ‘wartime mindset’
NATO head Mark Rutte on Thursday called for a shift to a wartime mindset - with much higher defense spending - warning the US-led transatlantic alliance that it was not ready for the threats it would face from Russia in the coming years, Reuters reported.
Rutte said future spending would have to be much higher than the current alliance target of 2% of national wealth as measured by gross domestic product (GDP).
“During the Cold War, Europeans spent far more than 3% of their GDP on defense,” Rutte said in a speech in Brussels. “We are going to need a lot more than 2%.”
“Russia is preparing for long-term confrontation, with Ukraine and with us,” Rutte said. “It is time to shift to a wartime mindset, and turbocharge our defense production and defence spending.”
His comments come as US President-elect Donald Trump has called for allies to spend 3% of GDP on defense.
The US on Thursday announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine in the coming days that will pull equipment out of US military stocks.
The Biden administration is working to surge deliveries of weapons to Ukraine in its final days in office in a concerted effort to put Kyiv on a strong footing going into 2025, according to a senior administration official.
In November, Biden authorized Ukraine to use powerful long-range American weapons inside Russia. Kyiv has used the newly granted powers to fire US-made ATACMS missiles at Russian targets across the border on multiple occasions.
Trump has said he “vehemently” disagrees with allowing Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia, and that by doing so the US is “escalating this war and making it worse.”
On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lauded his comments, saying Moscow has the same view of the causes leading to the escalation of the conflict.
When asked about Russia’s hopes for the war to end after Trump takes office, Peskov said in a press briefing that the Kremlin will wait and see after the inauguration.

The push is in stark contrast to that of the incoming Trump administration, with President-elect Donald Trump sharply criticizing a recent US move to allow Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia in an interview with Time Magazine published Thursday.
In the latest show of support for Ukraine, the Biden administration on Thursday evening announced a $500 million aid package that will pull equipment out of the US military’s stocks.
The senior administration official told CNN that the administration is pouring resources into getting previously announced weapons for Ukraine into Kyiv’s hands before Biden leaves office.
“DoD is undertaking a historic effort to move massive quantities of weapons into Ukraine in the next five weeks,” the senior administration official said. “Between now and mid-January, we will deliver to Ukraine hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, hundreds of armored vehicles, and other critical capabilities.”
An interagency effort to deliver the weapons is being led by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, the senior official said. In November, Sullivan told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on behalf of the president to “accelerate” the deliveries of armored vehicles, rockets, artillery and more to Ukraine. The Pentagon is now conducting sealifts and airlifts to meet the delivery deadline.
Sullivan just briefed Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, about the sealifts and airlifts last week, a source familiar with the matter said. David Shimer, the National Security Council’s Ukraine director, has been coordinating with the Pentagon on their efforts specifically.
The renewed push for delivery to Ukraine hasn’t changed the situation that there are no US boots on the ground in Ukraine, the source familiar said, and the weapons are being moved through Europe the way they have been throughout the war. But the source said that the surge in deliveries is involving a significant number of flights and sea vessels.
Meanwhile, in the interview with Time — which was conducted in late November but published Thursday with Trump’s selection as the 2024 Person of the Year — Trump was pushed on how he will support Ukraine after taking office. He said in the interview that he “vehemently” disagreed with the decision by the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to strike inside Russia with US-provided weapons.
“We’re just escalating this war and making it worse,” Trump said. “That should not have been allowed to be done. Now they’re doing not only missiles, but they’re doing other types of weapons. And I think that’s a very big mistake, very big mistake.”
Mike Waltz, Trump’s pick to be the next national security adviser, has been weighing proposals for ending the war, including one from retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg — whom Trump announced as his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia — that would make continued US aid to Ukraine contingent on Ukraine’s participation in peace talks with Russia. Another proposal would allow Russia to keep the territory it currently holds in exchange for giving Ukraine NATO membership.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he wants to work “directly” with Trump and that he believes the war will end “faster”when he is president. Trump and Zelensky met just last week in Paris, along with French President Emmanuel Macron.
CNN has reported that the Pentagon is unlikely to use all of the nearly $7 billion left in funding that was authorized by Congress to arm Ukraine by the time Biden leaves office, largely due to limitations in the military’s ability to refill its own stocks. The source familiar, though, said the administration is confident that they’ll use the appropriated funding for Ukraine, drawing a distinction from what was authorized.
But still, the biggest challenge facing Ukraine is not its weapons stocks, the senior administration official said — it’s manpower. The source familiar with the matter said that the Biden administration’s emphasis on Kyiv’s need to address its manning issue is part of the larger push to ensure Ukraine is in as good a position as possible going into 2025.
“Ukraine is not currently mobilizing or training enough soldiers to staff its front-line units,” the official said. “The US stands ready to help train newly mobilized soldiers: If Ukraine mobilizes additional soldiers and sends them to training sites outside of Ukraine, we will train them. But first, Ukraine needs to make the decision to mobilize more soldiers.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/europe/russian-forces-close-ukraine-pokrovsk-intl-latam/index.html,Russian forces just three kilometers from key Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk,2024-12-11 18:31:46,"Russian forces are now just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the outskirts of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk after making advances Wednesday, according to Ukrainian mapping service DeepState. They have also destroyed or captured Ukrainian positions near the city, a Ukrainian army spokesperson said.
“The enemy attacked our fortifications in the Pokrovsk sector west of Vidrodzennia village, south of Novotroitske and, as a result of prolonged fighting, two of our positions were destroyed and one was lost,” Ukrainian military spokesperson Nazar Voloshyn said in televised comments.
Voloshyn added that fighting is ongoing on the outskirts of Shevchenkove, a village in Kharkiv region on Ukraine’s eastern front. Ukrainian military bloggers have reported that the village has fallen to the Russians, a claim that has not been confirmed by Ukrainian or Russian officials.
Data from DeepState, a Ukrainian monitoring group and mapping service, showed Russian soldiers just three kilometers from the southern outskirts of Pokrovsk Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian gas supply regulator Donetskoblgaz has warned that Pokrovsk will be cut off from gas supplies from Thursday due to the “worsening situation.”
“Due to significant damage to gas pipelines and constant hostile attacks, it is impossible to eliminate the consequences of hostilities on the gas distribution system and restore gas supply to customers,” Donetskoblgaz said in a statement Tuesday.
For months, Pokrovsk has been the site of some of the fiercest battles on the eastern front as Russia attempts to close in on the city. It lies around 11 miles from Ukraine’s Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions and is a strategic target for Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear that his goal is to seize the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
Although not a major city – Pokrovsk had a population of around 60,000 before the war and many have now left since Russia’s full-scale invasion – it sits on a key supply road that connects it with military hubs. It forms the backbone of Ukrainian defenses in the part of Donetsk region that is still under Kyiv’s control. There are currently 11,000 people in Pokrovsk, according to local authorities.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the embattled city in November and met troops defending the city. In a video posted on his social media, Zelensky is seen shaking hands with soldiers and presenting them with awards.
“This is a tense and challenging direction,” he said at the time. “It is only thanks to the strength of our warriors that the east has not been completely occupied by Russia. The enemy is confronted every day.”
The fall of Pokrovsk to Moscow’s forces would mark the largest setback for Ukraine in months and come as Ukraine has struggled to get off the backfoot while Russian troops pile severe pressure on the eastern front lines.
A looming Donald Trump presidency in the United States has raised the risk that military aid from Ukraine’s largest source could stop flowing as the conflict grinds well into its second year.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a $725 million aid package to Ukraine Monday, as the Biden administration rushes to bolster Kyiv in its remaining time in office.
Russia vows response to alleged ‘ATACMS’ attack
Elsewhere in Russia’s war on Ukraine, Moscow on Wednesday vowed to respond to a Ukrainian attack on a southwestern Russian city that it claims involved six American-made ATACMS ballistic missiles.
The six long-range missiles were launched at the port city of Taganrog in the Rostov region in a morning attack that injured Russian military personnel, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.
Ukraine has acknowledged making “tangible hits on Russian targets,” including military and energy facilities, but has not said what type of missiles were used.
In a statement on Telegram Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to allude to the attack, saying, “This is exactly the kind of range and accuracy that brings Russia back to reality step by step – to the reality that the war needs to end.”
Russia’s warning comes just weeks after it fired a new type of hypersonic ballistic missile – the “Oreshnik” – at Ukraine in what it said was a response to Kyiv’s use of long-range American and British weapons.
In Wednesday’s attack, according to Moscow, Russian air defenses shot down two of the missiles, while electronic warfare equipment deflected the others.
However, the ministry said Russian military personnel were injured by falling fragments of the missiles, without specifying how many.
There was also minor damage to two buildings on the site of an airfield and three military vehicles, as well as civilian cars in a parking lot nearby, it said.
The ministry said it had “reliably established” that American-made ATACMS were used in the attack, and vowed retaliation, warning that the use of long-range Western weaponry would not go unpunished.
“Appropriate measures will be taken,” the ministry said.
A US official warned on Wednesday that Russia could launch another Oreshnik missile at Ukraine in the coming days, according to Reuters.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/ukraine-aid-austin-zelensky-trump/index.html,Defense secretary announces nearly $1 billion in Ukraine aid as he forcefully argues for global US leadership,2024-12-07 22:30:03,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday announced a $1 billion military aid package for Ukraine as he forcefully argued for US leadership around the world.
“The troubles of our times will only grow worse without strong and steady American leadership,” Austin said in his fourth consecutive appearance at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California.
The package, which includes more drones and ammunition for a critical rocket system, brings the total US security assistance to Ukraine to $62 billion since the war started nearly three years ago, a key component of keeping Kyiv in the fight. Russia has suffered more than 700,000 battlefield casualties since the war began, Austin said, and “squandered” more than $200 billion.
The US has led a coalition of countries to arm and equip Ukraine’s military since February 2022, and Austin said it would be a mistake to abandon Kyiv.
“This administration has made its choice. So has a bipartisan coalition in Congress,” said Austin. “The next administration must make its own choice.”
Though the outgoing defense secretary did not mention Donald Trump by name, his arguments for American engagement internationally contrasted sharply with the president-elect’s promise of “America first.” Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the value of US aid to Ukraine, and Vice President-elect JD Vance has said in the past that Russia is not an existential threat to Europe.
Austin’s message on the importance of aid to Ukraine came the same day Trump met Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky in Paris before the reopening of Notre Dame. The two met in the Élysée Palace with French President Emmanuel Macron for just over an hour Saturday.
Zelensky described it as a “good and productive trilateral meeting” in a post on social media afterward.
“We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way,” he said, adding that “President Trump is, as always, resolute.”
But key members of Trump’s incoming administration have questioned the value of foreign aid in general and military aid to Ukraine specifically.
Vivek Ramaswamy, the co-chair of Trump’s commission to cut government spending, said he intends to examine whether foreign aid is worth the taxpayer dollars.
“How does that actually advance a purpose that serves the US taxpayer in the best interests of the United States of America?” Ramaswamy asked rhetorically on C-SPAN last week.
Austin argued that it is precisely this foreign engagement that helps preserve and uphold what he refers to as the rules-based international order. In a look back at his time as defense secretary, Austin highlighted increased US military cooperation with Japan and the Philippines, as well as new agreements with India and Australia.
The US has also sent $13.6 billion in aid to Israel as part of nearly 400 cases of foreign military sales since its war against Hamas began just over a year ago, Austin said.
“The world built by American leadership can only be maintained by American leadership,” the outgoing secretary said.",['Oren Liebermann'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/04/europe/russia-ukraine-ryabkov-stronger-means-intl-hnk/index.html,"Russia will use ‘even stronger military means’ if Western pressure continues, warns deputy foreign minister",2024-12-04 10:23:06,"Russia will resort to “even stronger military means” in its war with Ukraine if the US and its allies fail to recognize it cannot be tested indefinitely, Moscow’s deputy foreign minister told CNN’s Fred Pleitgen in an exclusive interview on Wednesday.
“Risks are high and they are growing, and that’s quite disturbing,” Sergei Ryabkov said during a sit-down interview in Moscow, adding that the current geopolitical tensions were unheard of even “at the height of the Cold War.”
Ryabkov said there was “no magic solution” to the conflict. He claimed there is a lack of common sense and “restraint in the West, in particular the US, where people seemingly underestimate our resolve to defend our core national security interests.”
US President Joe Biden’s administration on Tuesday announced a $725 million security assistance package for Ukraine. It called the package an attempt to put Kyiv “in the strongest possible position” as Russia steps up its attacks and Biden prepares to leave office in less than two months.
The administration has a matter of weeks to use up nearly $7 billion, part of a larger package authorized by Congress earlier this year to help Ukraine in the war, which began in February 2022.
The risk of military escalation shouldn’t be underestimated and depends on decisions in Washington, Ryabkov said, while citing the US government’s “very obvious inability to truly appreciate that Moscow cannot be pressurized indefinitely.”
“There will come a moment when we will see no other choice but to resort to even stronger military means,” the minister said, adding an escalation is unlikely to happen “right away.”
“But the trend is there,” he said.
Referring to the outgoing Biden administration, Ryabkov said Russia will respond to any provocation and “find a way to assert our strong will.”
Russia has also threatened to strike Ukraine again with the nuclear-capable “Oreshnik” ballistic missile that Moscow used in its widespread attack on critical energy infrastructure in late November.
Ryabkov said Oreshnik “is not a strategic ballistic missile, it’s an intermediate-range missile tested in combat.”
Former US President Donald Trump’s 2019 decision to withdraw the US from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a decades-old arms control agreement between the US and Russia, paved the way for Moscow developing its new ballistic arsenal, Ryabkov said.
‘Zero’ chance of compromise
Had it not been for Trump’s decision, “there would be no Oreshnik in our hands and we would be restrained in our capability to develop such weapons,” Ryabkov added.
Russia has not had direct contact with Trump or his team regarding the president-elect’s earlier comments on ending the Ukraine war in one day, according to Ryabkov. “We will be there when they come with ideas … but not at the expense of our national interest,” the minister said.
Addressing the possibility of peace talks with Ukraine, Ryabkov said the two countries’ positions are incompatible.
“Chances for a compromise at the moment are zero. The moment people in Kyiv begin to understand there’s no way Russia will go the way they suggested – there might be openings and opportunities.”

“Today, we are announcing a $725 million security assistance package for Ukraine, which includes substantial quantities of artillery, rockets, and air defense capabilities,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote in a statement. “The President has directed the Department of Defense to deliver the materiel to Ukraine rapidly — to ensure that Ukraine has the equipment it needs to defend itself.”
Sullivan wrote that, between December and mid-January, “we will deliver hundreds of thousands of additional artillery rounds, thousands of additional rockets, and other critical capabilities to help Ukraine defend its freedom and independence.”
The statement twice refers to putting “Ukrainian forces in the strongest possible position” before Biden’s term ends.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken first made the announcement earlier Monday. The new tranche of military assistance includes Stinger missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and anti-personnel landmines.
Blinken arrived in Brussels on Tuesday morning for his last meeting of the NATO foreign ministers. The top US diplomat said his country was determined to support Ukraine and accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of “once again weaponizing winter, trying to freeze people out of their homes.”
In a speech earlier Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte highlighted how Ukraine is entering “another crucial winter,” while aggression from Russia and Putin show “no sign of abating.”
“Putin is not interested in peace. He is pressing on, trying to take more territory because he thinks he can break Ukraine’s resolve and ours,” Rutte said. “But he is wrong. Ukraine has a right to defend itself, and we have a duty to help them.”
The provision of the military aid is part of a larger strategy to bolster Ukraine, which has been complemented by shifts in policies on the provision of antipersonnel land mines and Kyiv’s use of US-provided long-range weapons.
Still, two US officials and three defense officials told CNN last week that the Pentagon is unlikely to use all of the billions of dollars authorized by Congress to arm Ukraine before Biden leaves office.
The administration has fewer than two months left to use nearly $7 billion, part of a larger package authorized by Congress earlier this year to help Ukraine in the war with Russia. The funding allows the Defense Department to draw from its own stockpiles to send weapons, but shortages have limited how much the US can send to Kyiv in recent months.
For months, the US has run into the limits of its ability to replenish its own weapons inventories, which limited what the Biden administration has been able to send Ukraine. The US has been growing its capacity to produce critical munitions, such as 155mm artillery shells, since virtually the beginning of the war nearly three years ago, but the ramp up in production is not yet complete.
State Department officials briefed Congress in November that the administration is still working to allocate the remaining funds, according to a congressional source familiar with the matter.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-soldiers-incursion-intl/index.html,Kursk offensive: Ukraine’s soldiers fight to hold onto Russian region,2024-12-03 06:00:48,"The dawn assault inside Russia’s Kursk region never even got to a gunfight, yet betrayed the intensity of the battle in Kremlin territory. Five Russians edged forward in the grey Sunday dawn but, as thermal drone imagery shows, were killed or wounded by a drone as they tried to hide in the treeline.
“I have this impression that (the Russians) have unlimited people,” said Oleksandr, a unit commander with the 225th assault battalion, describing the clash from a cafe in the Ukrainian city of Sumy, 11 hours later.
“They send groups, and almost no one remains alive. And the next day, the groups go again. The next Russians, it seems, do not know what happened to the previous Russians. They go there, into the unknown. No one tells them anything about it, and no one comes back.”
Oleksandr and two colleagues with whom he is sitting are hard of hearing from the constant shelling. They provide a rare insight into the nearly four-month-long Ukrainian occupation of Kursk.
The August invasion marked a rare tactical success and strategic gain for Kyiv, although the use of significant manpower and armor in the assault has led to criticism that shortages created by the invasion contributed to Russia’s advance across the Donbas eastern front.
Advocates of the Kursk operation suggest it provided Kyiv with vital leverage for any future peace talks – perhaps initiated by US President-elect Donald Trump – which means Ukraine needs to retain a foothold in the area into spring at the least.
Oleksandr expressed confidence his unit could hold on, but less certainty as to why. “I don’t know what the goal really is,” he said. “Maybe we should walk around here for four months and turn around and leave, for example… If the goal is to hold on to it until a certain point, we will.”
Asked what his message for Trump would be, Oleksandr demanded the West uphold the security guarantees it gave Ukraine in return for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons, in a 1994 treaty known as the Budapest Memorandum, in which Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States gave Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan assurances for giving up their Soviet-era nuclear weapons.
“You took away our nuclear weapons? You promised us your roof,” Oleksandr said, using a slang word for protection. “Keep your word. We’re being slaughtered, and you’re still trying to play games, to defend your interests. You had to give everything you could to end this war in two days. Who will believe the words of the US or England, who are pissing themselves in front of Russia? Pardon my English,” he said laughing, in explanation of his profanity.
Recent Russian assaults in his area of Kursk have proven as ineffective as costly, he said. Separately, Ukrainian officials have admitted that 40% of the territory they took in the late summer has since been reclaimed by the Russians. Oleksandr’s unit has not slept for three days, he said, or left the frontline for eight months, and has been involved in ferocious combat in the Ukrainian cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Chasiv Yar.
He said the Russian troops Ukrainians faced in Kursk were a mixture of well-trained paratroopers from the 76th Brigade, but also less organised Chechens, and African mercenaries. But he has seen no sign of the 12,000 North Korean troops that, according to the Pentagon, have been sent to Kursk. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky also told the Japanese Kyodo news agency Sunday that some North Koreans had been killed by Ukrainian forces and that they would ultimately be used as “cannon fodder” by the Kremlin.
“When we catch them or see a body,” Oleksandr said, “then I’ll know for sure that they’re here.”
Three weeks earlier, his unit had faced an assault from 40 armored vehicles and about 300 infantry, he said. His drone commander, callsign “JS” for Java Script, said the unit killed 50 Russians that day. “The vehicles that managed to get through unloaded the infantry,” JS recounted, “then we finished off the infantry. And it went like this for nearly 24 hours, no sleep, and the next day we finished off those who managed to hide from the drone-bombing on the first day.”",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/02/europe/putin-russia-defense-budget-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html,Putin approves record defense spending - a third of Russia’s budget,2024-12-02 05:09:02,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a record-breaking defense budget, setting aside a staggering third of the government’s total spending as the war in Ukraine drains resources from both sides nearly three years on.
The budget for 2025, which was published Sunday, allocates about $126 billion (13.5 trillion rubles) to national defense – amounting to 32.5% of government spending.
The defense budget is about $28 billion (three trillion rubles) higher than the previous record set this year.
The new three-year budget forecasts a slight reduction in military spending for 2026 and 2027. Lawmakers in both houses of the Russian parliament approved the budget.
Russia’s war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. Moscow is currently making gains at key spots along the front lines and fighting a counteroffensive in Kursk region – the site of Kyiv’s only major military success this year.
But the slow, grinding war – often called a war of attrition, where both sides are trying to wear down the other – has drained both countries’ resources.
Ukraine has always been on the back foot when it comes to both material and manpower, though it has received billions of dollars in help from its Western allies, including more than half a billion in new military equipment pledged by Germany on Monday.
How much aid will continue to come from the United States once President-elect Donald Trump takes office remains to be seen.
Meanwhile, Russia has more weapons, more ammunition and more personnel – but the strain on its economy and population is growing.
Russia has massively increased its military spending over the past two years and its economy is showing signs of overheating: inflation is running high, and companies are facing labor shortages. Trying to control the situation, the Russian Central Bank raised interest rates to 21% in October, the highest in decades.
Meanwhile, Ukraine continues to receive significant military assistance from its allies.
On Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Kyiv for the first time in more than two years, where he pledged more than 650 million euros ($684 million) in military equipment for Ukraine.
Scholz announced that Germany would deliver additional air defenses – including the US-made Patriot system – to Ukraine next year.
Scholz’s visit came after he rankled Ukrainian officials last month by calling Vladimir Putin, ending a years-long European effort to isolate the Russian president following his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Speaking alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a press conference in Kyiv, Scholz said he had used the call to stress to Putin that “Ukraine should be an independent sovereign nation” and that “Russia has to stop the war and withdraw its troops.”
Meanwhile, although Russia has many more people than Ukraine, it is suffering significant battlefield losses and recruitment of new troops is already a problem – the last time the Russian military introduced a partial mobilization, hundreds of thousands of men fled the country.
North Korea recently sent an influx of soldiers to help Russia fight on the front lines – Zelensky said in November that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers were in Kursk.
Some of Russia’s weaponry is also North Korean, accounting for almost a third of the ballistic missiles fired at Ukraine this year, according to Ukrainian defense officials and CNN’s tally of attacks.
The North Korean troops may help Russia’s efforts for some time – but the material losses could be harder to make up for.","['Jessie Yeung', 'Mariya Knight']",en

Sunday’s vote will elect a new government and prime minister and determine the formation of the 466-seat legislature. Romanians living abroad have been able to vote since Saturday. By 5 p.m., about 7.5 million people – about 42% of eligible voters – had cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau.
The legislative vote comes a week after the first round of a presidential race that saw a controversial far-right populist who was polling in single digits win the most votes. Calin Georgescu, 62, is due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR, in a Dec. 8 runoff.
TikTok exposure raises questions
Georgescu’s success, which many have attributed to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok, has triggered nightly protests throughout Romania by those who oppose his past remarks praising Romanian fascist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin and view him as a threat to democracy.
Many observers believe the presidential outcome indicates a sharp shift from Romania’s mainstream parties to more populist anti-establishment parties, whose voices have found fertile ground amid high inflation, high cost of living and a sluggish economy.
Alexandru Rizescu, a 24-year-old medical student, says he was surprised by the result in the first-round presidential ballot and that it’s an “obvious sign” Europe at large is shifting toward far-right populism.
“Most of us are sick of these big parties, but now we have to think about the … lesser evil,” he said. “If Georgescu becomes president, with a favorable parliament, it’s going to be wild.”
According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu’s TikTok account before last week’s vote saw an explosion of engagement, which it said appeared “sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.”
Without naming Georgescu, who declared zero campaign spending, Romania’s top defense body said Thursday that “a presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment” granted by TikTok. Romania has become a “priority target for hostile actions” by Russia, it added. The Kremlin denies it is meddling.
The same day, the Constitutional Court requested a recount of all 9.4 million votes after a presidential candidate who obtained 1% filed a complaint alleging the USR had violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. The Central Election Bureau approved the request and said scanned reports were due to be sent in by Sunday night. On Friday, the court postponed a decision until Monday on whether to annul the vote.
Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, predicted the general election could also be reshaped by Georgescu’s success, with far-right parties possibly obtaining record highs.
“The impact of the surprise in last Sunday’s presidential election will be significant, and we are going to wake up in a new political reality,” he told The Associated Press. “Georgescu voters will speak again and will reshape how we look at the political Romanian spectrum from now on and probably forever.”
“The most probable scenario will be a difficult-to-build majority in the parliament to support and endorse a new government,” he added.
High-stakes election
Despite historically being Romania’s two main opposition parties that have dominated post-communist politics, the Social Democratic Party, PSD, and the National Liberal Party, PNL, formed an unlikely coalition in 2021, which has become increasingly strained. A small ethnic Hungarian party exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute.
After casting his ballot on Sunday, incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu told the media that Romanians “have to choose between stability and chaos.”
“Today is a very important day for all of us Romanians to stay on our European and North Atlantic path,” he said. “This is the most important choice we have to make today.”
Georgescu told the media Sunday that he voted “so the good prevails over evil.”
“I voted for peace, not for war, for respect, for total political responsibility, dedicated totally to Romanian people,” he said. “I voted for Romania, along with Romania, forever for Romania.”
While the presidential role in Romania has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security and foreign policy, the prime minister is the head of the nation’s government.
Recent surveys have suggested the top three parties in Sunday’s race will be the PSD, the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians and the PNL. After rising to the political scene eight years ago on an anti-corruption ticket, the USR’s popularity has diminished in recent years, but could garner the next most votes.
More minor parties that may not pass the 5% threshold to enter parliament include the pro-EU reformist REPER party and the liberal-conservative Force of the Right. Some have predicted that the far-right nationalist S.O.S Romania party, and the little-known Party of Young People, which has backed Georgescu, could pass the threshold.
Sens, a progressive grassroots party founded last year that advocates for improvements in sustainability and transparency, could also garner enough votes to enter parliament.
Silviu Safta, a 30-year-old retail manager in Bucharest, said that Georgescu topping the polls was “a surprise for everyone, except for the 2 million people that voted for him,” and that he’s skeptical whether Sunday’s parliamentary vote will follow the same populist tilt.
“I think Romanians will be more informed about their elections and … their candidates,” he said. “I’m a little bit skeptical about the results, but I hope that democracy will win.”",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-war-intl/index.html,Zelensky wants to ‘work directly’ with Trump on ending Ukraine’s war with Russia,2024-09-27 00:00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he wants to work “directly” with US President-elect Donald Trump and is open to his ideas, highlighting Kyiv’s eagerness to keep its most important ally onside as Russia intensifies its attacks.
“Of course we will work with Trump. I want to work with him directly,” Zelensky said in an interview with Sky News released Friday, adding that he did not want people around Trump to “destroy” their communication. “I want to share with him ideas and I want to hear from him his ideas,” he added.
The United States is the single largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine and Kyiv is keenly aware that it needs to stay on Trump’s good side to secure future support. According to the US Department of State, the government has contributed $64.1 billion to Ukraine’s war effort since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Zelensky characterized his conversations with Trump during a visit to New York in September as “warm, good, constructive.” He said the discussions were an “important first step,” but that more detailed talks would be needed “until we will have a real plan where Ukraine is strong.”
Zelensky noted that his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, would travel to the US as soon as possible for meetings, including with Trump’s pick to be special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg.
Kellogg favors a ceasefire and peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, which would include security guarantees for Ukraine to protect against future Russian invasions.
Zelensky told Sky News that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not ready to negotiate, however. “He doesn’t want to stop the war,” he said.
The Ukrainian leader added that he would like Trump to succeed and for the US to “play one of the most crucial parts” in ending the war.
Prior to winning the election, Trump repeatedly claimed that the Russia-Ukraine war would not have started if he had been president. He also vowed to end the war, sometimes even claiming he would stop the years-long conflict before taking office. In July, he said he could settle the conflict in one day, without offering further details.
NATO membership
Zelensky’s comments come as the scale and severity of the conflict escalates, as Moscow makes increasing use of non-nuclear ballistic missiles. More than one million Ukrainian households were left without power Thursday following a widespread attack on critical energy infrastructure.
On Friday, Putin threatened to strike Ukraine again. He also praised Trump, describing him as an “intelligent and experienced” politician capable of finding “solutions.”
In the interview with Sky News, Zelensky stressed that Ukraine’s US and European allies needed to better equip a greater number of its soldiers and provide more fighter jets. The country’s eastern front, where Moscow is fast advancing, “depends on the number of equipped brigades” and air defense, he added.
He also addressed widely reported calls by US officials to drop Ukraine’s minimum conscription age from 25 to 18 to address a critical shortage of manpower. “I want to ask our partners to do their part of the job and we will do our part of the job,” he said.
Asked by Sky News whether Ukraine would consider ceding some territory to Russia in exchange for NATO membership, Zelensky said that such a solution could in theory help to end the war but that it would run counter to Ukraine’s constitution.
“The invitation (to join NATO) must be given to Ukraine within its internationally recognized border. You can’t give an invitation to just one part of the country… You have no right to recognize the occupied territory as territory of Russia,” he said.
Zelensky has long called for Ukraine’s unconditional accession to NATO, but it is highly unlikely that the country will be admitted to the military alliance before the war ends. During the interview, Zelensky reiterated his position that NATO membership was currently the only path to victory.
He admitted that he was afraid Ukraine might lose the war, and particularly the independence of its people. “If we will be alone, we will lose,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/29/europe/trump-new-ukraine-envoy-analysis-intl/index.html,Trump’s Ukraine envoy has a plan to end the war that Putin may revel in,2024-11-29 05:00:48,"In a single post, the president-elect told the world what the end of the Ukraine war might look like. And it is going to be a big diplomatic ask, to say the least.
“I am very pleased to nominate General Keith Kellogg to serve as Assistant to the President and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social channel. “Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!”
By appointing Keith Kellogg as his special envoy to Ukraine, Donald Trump has also chosen a very specific, pre-announced plan for the thorniest foreign policy issue on his plate.
Kellogg, Trump’s 80-year-old former national security advisor, has laid out his peace plan in some detail, writing for the America First policy institute in April.
It begins calling the war “an avoidable crisis that, due to the Biden Administration’s incompetent policies… has entangled America in an endless war.”
In short, a ceasefire will freeze the frontlines and both sides will be forced to the negotiating table. But it is in the longer details where it all gets complex.
Changing the US’ involvement
Kellogg spends most time berating Biden’s actions - saying that his administration gave too little lethal aid too late. He says Trump’s decision to give the first lethal aid to Ukraine in 2018 conveyed the strength needed to confront Putin, and that Trump’s soft approach to the Kremlin head - not demonizing him like Biden has - will enable him to strike a deal.
Kellogg says more weapons should have been given before the Russian invasion, and immediately afterwards, to enable Ukraine to win.
But that’s when the plan – which CNN has reported that Trump’s soon-to-be national security adviser is considering - stops being to Ukraine’s liking.
Kellogg says the United States doesn’t need involvement in another conflict, and its own stocks of weaponry have suffered from aiding Ukraine, leaving the country potentially exposed in any conflict with China over Taiwan. He says Ukraine’s NATO membership - in truth a very distant prospect, tentatively offered to Kyiv in symbolic solidarity - should be put on hold indefinitely, “in exchange for a comprehensive and verifiable peace deal with security guarantees.”
Foremost, the plan says it should become “a formal US policy to seek a ceasefire and negotiated settlement.”
It says future US aid - likely given as a loan - will be conditioned on Ukraine negotiating with Russia, and the US will arm Ukraine to the extent it can defend itself and stop any further Russian advances before and after any peace deal. This latter suggestion is perhaps dated by the fast Moscow advance underway in eastern Ukraine and the current high US level of aid already makes Kellogg uncomfortable.
Kellogg credits partially a 2023 article by Richard Haas and Charles Kupchan for some of the next ideas.
A freeze to the frontlines
The frontlines would be frozen by a ceasefire, and a demilitarized zone imposed. For agreeing to this, Russia would get limited sanctions relief, and full relief only when a peace deal is signed that is to Ukraine’s liking. A levy on Russian energy exports would pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Ukraine would not be asked to give up on reclaiming occupied territory, but it would agree to pursue it through diplomacy alone. It accepts “this would require a future diplomatic breakthrough which probably will not occur before Putin leaves office.”
It is fetchingly simple and swift in its approach. But it lacks an accommodation of what Moscow will demand and has used the diplomatic process for in the past: To cynically pursue military advances. The freezing of the frontlines will precipitate a very violent few months ahead as Moscow seeks to take as much ground as it can. The Kremlin has in the past ignored ceasefires and pursued its territorial objectives - often blankly denying that it is.
A demilitarized zone would likely need to be policed, possibly putting NATO troops, or soldiers from other non-aligned nations, in between the two sides. That will be hard to maintain and staff, to say the least. It would be enormous, spanning hundreds of miles of border, and a massive financial investment.
Arming Ukraine to the extent it can stop present and future Russian advances will also be tough. The plan notes the United States manufactures 14,000 155 artillery rounds a month, which Ukraine can use up in just 48 hours. Paradoxically, Kellogg wants the US to arm Ukraine more, yet also accepts they really can’t.
A change in values
Two lines provide a wider insight into the author’s thinking. He says that national security, the America First way, was about practical necessities.
“Biden replaced the Trump approach with a liberal internationalist one that promoted Western values, human rights, and democracy,” he writes. That is a pretty grim base from which to build a compromise on European security.
He adds that some critics of continued aid to Ukraine - in which he seems to include himself - are “worried about whether America’s vital strategic interests are at stake in the Ukraine War, the potential of the involvement of US military forces and whether America is engaged in a proxy war with Russia that could escalate into a nuclear conflict.”
These two sentences provide the ultimate backdrop for the deal proposed: That Ukraine’s war is about values we don’t need to perpetuate, and we should step back from Putin’s nuclear threat. It is the opposite of the current unity in which the West prioritizes the values of its own way of life and security, based on the lesson of the Thirties that appeased dictators don’t stop.
The plan presents Ukraine with a welcome chance for an end to the violence, at a time when it is losing on all fronts, and darkly short of basic manpower - a hurdle it may never overcome, and something in which Russia will likely always outpace it.
But it begins a process in which a wily and deceitful Putin will revel. Exploiting a ceasefire and Western weakness is his forte, the moment he has been waiting nearly three years for. The plan accepts Western fatigue, that its armament production cannot keep pace, and that its values are wasteful. It also makes little accommodation for what Russia will do to upset its vision.
It is a bleak compromise for a bleak war. But it may not end it and instead open a new chapter where Western unity and support begins to crumble, and Putin edges, both at the negotiating table and at the front, closer towards his goals.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/28/europe/ukraine-russia-war-power-cut-intl-hnk/index.html,Putin threatens to strike Ukraine again with Russia’s new Oreshnik ballistic missile after wave of attacks on energy,2024-11-28 08:40:04,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Ukraine again with a new nuclear-capable ballistic missile following Moscow’s latest widespread attack on critical energy infrastructure.
More than a million households in Ukraine were left without power following the overnight bombardment, authorities in the country said Thursday. It’s Russia’s 11th large-scale assault on Ukraine’s energy supplies this year alone, according to the Energy Ministry in Kyiv, a strategy that has caused nationwide rolling blackouts.
Speaking at a security summit in Kazakhstan Thursday, Putin claimed the overnight attacks were a response to strikes on Russian territory using US-made ATACMS missiles. He also warned he would consider further launches of Russia’s new “Oreshnik” medium-range ballistic missile, first fired at Ukraine’s Dnipro region last week.
“We will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory by Western-made long-range missiles, including the possible continuation of the Oreshnik test in combat conditions,” he said.
Putin also praised US President-elect Donald Trump, describing him as an “intelligent and experienced” politician capable of finding “solutions,” as tensions rise between Moscow and Kyiv’s Western partners.
The Russian leader claimed his forces hit 17 targets, describing them as “military facilities, defense industry facilities and their support systems,” without acknowledging the attacks on power infrastructure. “As I have said many times, there will always be a response from our side (to the use of American ATACMS),” Putin said.
Putin, who has previously said that Moscow considers itself entitled to use weapons against military targets belonging to countries that allow their weapons to be used against Russia, also threatened further strikes.
Russia’s Ministry of Defense is “selecting targets for hitting on Ukrainian territory,” he said. “These could be military facilities, defense industry enterprises or decision-making centers in Kyiv.”
Russia’s use of the Oreshnik ballistic missile, which carries multiple warheads, last week marked a decisive, and potentially dangerous moment in Moscow’s conflict with the West, and may be the first time such a weapon has been used in war.
Putin claimed the missile can get around air defense systems and if several warheads are used together, “the force of the strike will be comparable to the use of nuclear weapons.”
“Everything that is in the epicenter of the explosion is divided into fractions, into elementary particles, essentially turning into dust,” Putin said, adding that the missile “has no nuclear charge.”
The Russian missile attack on Dnipro was not armed with nuclear warheads, but it used a weapon designed for nuclear delivery to instead launch conventional weapons.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the use of the new missile was “a clear and severe escalation in the scale and brutality of this war.”
‘Every winter is getting harder’
Ukraine’s energy system came “under massive enemy attack,” overnight, Energy Minister German Halushchenko said Thursday. Bombardments have intensified in recent months, leaving Ukraine in a precarious position as the war grinds into its third winter.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia used cluster munitions in the attack. The weapons, which disperse numerous small bombs over a large area, “make it more more difficult for our rescuers and power engineers” to respond to strikes, Zelensky said.
In the immediate aftermath, Ukraine’s energy operator introduced emergency power cuts in many regions, with large outages in the western regions of Lviv, Volyn and Rivne. It has since shifted back to implementing scheduled hourly power cuts.
At least five people were injured, including one in the central Vinnytsia region, two in the southern Odesa region, and two in the capital Kyiv, officials said. In Kharkiv, a missile struck a civilian business, according to military authorities.
In a statement Thursday, US President Joe Biden condemned the “horrific” attack, which he said “serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression.”
Air defenses were activated across the country, with damage reported in 14 regions, according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. In Kyiv, residents took shelter in metro stations as an air raid alert for the combined missile and drone attack sounded for more than nine hours.
“This morning I heard about three explosions,” Valeriy Dorotiy, a resident of Lutsk, in western Ukraine’s Volyn region, told CNN. He said he couldn’t tell if the blasts were from missiles or Ukrainian air defense interceptions. “After that, the power went out.”
About 215,000 households in the Volyn region were temporarily without power, authorities said earlier.
“I have a power bank for charging my phone, but I did not buy a more powerful station because I did not take it seriously that there would be such attacks and that missiles would reach us,” Dorotiy said, adding that it seemed Russia was concentrating on attacking eastern Ukraine instead. “But it did reach us.”
Kyiv resident Olha Vaynrikh, 32, told Reuters, “Our mornings begin with checking the phone to see if there is an air alert… We are indeed fed up with all of it.”
Roman Turiy, a resident of the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, told CNN that air raid sirens started at 6 a.m. time in his area. “Many missiles of the second wave were already flying toward our region. Around 8:17 a.m., I heard a very loud explosion over Ivano-Frankivsk… I also heard explosions further away in the region.”
Several critical infrastructure facilities had been attacked, he later discovered.
“I expected to be without power for three hours, but according to the new schedule, it looks like we will be without electricity for eight hours today,” Turiy said. “We all understand that every winter is getting harder.”
The onslaught involved about 100 drones and more than 90 missiles, according to Zelensky.
This comes after Russia launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine on Tuesday in a mass attack that damaged critical infrastructure in the west of the country, according to the Ukrainian Air Force.
“Every attack like this proves that air defense systems are needed in Ukraine now, where they save lives, not at storage bases,” Zelensky added, urging allies to help his country increase its air defense capabilities.

The country’s interior ministry said three police officers were injured.
Police ordered protesters to disperse, fired water cannon and deployed pepper spray and tear gas as masked young people tried to smash their way into the parliament. Some protesters tossed fireworks at police while shouting “Russians” and “Slaves!”
Georgia’s relations with the EU have deteriorated sharply in recent months as Brussels has alleged that the government had resorted to authoritarian measures and adopted pro-Russian stands.
Thousands of pro-EU protesters had blocked streets in the capital before the altercations began. The country’s figurehead president accused the government of declaring “war” on its own people and confronted riot police, asking whether they served Georgia or Russia.
The Georgian Dream governing bloc accused the EU of “a cascade of insults,” saying in a statement it was using the prospect of accession talks to “blackmail” the country, and to “organize a revolution in the country.”
As a result, it said: “We have decided not to put the issue of opening negotiations with the European Union on the agenda until the end of 2028. Also, we refuse any budgetary grant from the European Union until the end of 2028.”
The South Caucasus country of 3.7 million has the aim of EU accession written into its constitution and has long been among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union’s successor states.
With months of downturn in relations between Tbilisi and Brussels, the EU had already said that Georgia’s application for membership was frozen.
Georgian Dream says it is not pro-Russian, and that it is committed to democracy and integration with the West.
It says it still wants to join the EU eventually, but has repeatedly engaged in diplomatic feuds with Brussels in recent years, whilst deepening ties with neighbouring Russia.
There was no immediate formal comment from the EU on Georgian Dream’s statement. But an EU official said the impact of Thursday’s move was huge, adding the government was doing what the EU had feared and had hoped it would not.
Opinion polls show that around 80% of Georgians support EU membership, and the bloc’s flag flies alongside the national flag outside virtually all government buildings in the country.
The pro-Western opposition reacted to Georgian Dream’s announcement with fury as protesters massed. Local media reported that protests that erupted in provincial cities.
Giorgi Vashadze, a prominent opposition leader, wrote on Facebook: “the self-proclaimed, illegitimate government has already legally signed the betrayal of Georgia and the Georgian people.”
President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU critic of Georgian Dream whose powers are mostly ceremonial, said the ruling party had “declared not peace, but war against its own people, its past and future”.
Zourabichvili’s term ends in December, and Georgian Dream has nominated a former lawmaker with hardline anti-Western views to replace her.
The opposition says that an October election, in which official results gave the Georgian Dream bloc almost 54% of the vote, was fraudulent and have refused to take their seats. Western countries demand a probe into irregularities.
Both Georgian Dream and the country’s election commission say the election was free and fair.
Earlier on Thursday, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze told journalists that EU membership might harm Georgia’s economy, as it would require Tbilisi to cancel visa-free agreements and trade deals with other countries.
The EU gave Georgia candidate status in December 2023, but has said that a raft of laws passed since by Georgian Dream, including curbs on “foreign agents” and LGBT rights, are authoritarian, Russian-inspired, and obstacles to EU membership.
Foreign and domestic critics of Georgian Dream say the party, which is seen as dominated by its billionaire founder, ex-prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, is steering Georgia back toward Moscow, from which it gained independence in 1991.
Russia and Georgia have had no formal diplomatic relations since Moscow won a brief 2008 war, but have had a limited rapprochement recently.
Opinion polls show most Georgians dislike Russia, which continues to back two breakaway Georgian regions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking during a visit to Kazakhstan, praised the “courage and character” he said Georgian authorities had shown in passing the law on foreign agents, which domestic critics have likened to Russian legislation.

Putin’s threats became even fiercer this month after the Biden administration finally gave Kyiv permission to launch longer-range American weapons at targets deep inside Russia. In response, Putin updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine and fired a new, nuclear-capable ballistic missile at Ukraine. The message was taken as a clear threat to Ukraine’s backers: Don’t test us.
But, nearly three years into the war, these developments have assumed a familiar rhythm. Each time Ukraine made a request – first asking for tanks, then fighter jets, then cluster munitions, then long-range weapons – its allies agonized over whether to grant it, fearing it would escalate the conflict and provoke a Russian response.
Each time, when the West finally accepted Ukraine’s requests, Russia’s most catastrophic threats did not materialize. What was taboo one week became normal the next.
Despite Putin’s heightened threats since the latest taboo crumbled, there is little reason to believe that this time will be different, analysts told CNN.
Instead, they said the anxious reaction to Ukraine’s newly granted powers is another example of the Kremlin’s successful strategy of forcing the West to see the conflict on Russia’s terms, confusing each fresh attempt by Ukraine to resist Russian aggression as a major “escalation.”
Alongside the battlefields, the Kremlin has been engaged in a fight to force the West to argue from Russian premises rather than its own, and to “make decisions in that Kremlin-generation alternative reality that will allow Russia to win in the real world,” the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think-tank, said in a report in March.
Kateryna Stepanenko, a co-author of that report, told CNN the strategy was a revival of the Soviet concept “reflexive control,” by which a state imposes a false set of choices on its adversary, forcing the adversary to make decisions against its own interests.
“The persistent Western debates and delays in Western military aid to Ukraine is a clear example of the Kremlin’s successful reflexive control strategy, which had committed the Western to self-deterrence despite routine Russian escalations of the war,” Stepanenko said.
This strategy could be seen in action on Thursday after Russia launched a large-scale attack targeting Ukraine’s power grid. Although Putin said the attack was “a response from our side” to the Biden administration’s decision on longer-range weapons, Russia has not needed a pretext for such strikes in the past.
The recent policy changes by Ukraine’s Western allies – which came after Russia involved some 11,000 North Korean troops in its war effort – “is not an escalation as the Kremlin is attempting to frame it,” Stepanenko said.
“Russia launched an unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine and had been routinely escalating the war to sustain its initiative on the battlefield. The approval of Ukraine’s use of long-range strike systems against Russia is finally allowing Ukraine to level out its capabilities,” she said.
‘Nonsense’ policies
The Biden administration sent US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, to Ukraine earlier this year, but placed strict conditions on how they could be used: They could be fired at Russian targets in occupied Ukraine, but not on Russia’s own territory.
William Alberque, a former director of NATO’s Arms Control, Disarmament, and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre, said this policy made little sense – and was to Russia’s huge benefit.
By providing Ukraine with ATACMS but only allowing it to strike parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia, “we sent Russia the message: ‘You know what? If you just move a couple meters over that border, you’re safe as houses,’” Alberque told CNN.
“I’m sure the Russian commanders couldn’t believe their luck. ‘So if I set up my command headquarters here, they’ll blow me up, but if I set up a kilometer away, I’m fine? Really? Awesome!’”
In effect, this policy led to “the idea that Russia can kill anyone anywhere in Ukraine, but Ukraine can’t kill the troops that are actually attacking them if they’re across the border (in Russia).” This idea is “nonsense,” Alberque said.
Ukraine’s actions remain within the laws of armed conflict. As Poland’s Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski put it to CNN in September, “the victim of aggression has the right to defend itself also on the territory of the aggressor.”
Shifting red lines
Amid the anxious responses to last week’s developments, it is easy to forget that Ukraine has long launched home-grown drones at targets extremely deep in Russia – and that it had already fired Western weapons at territory the Kremlin considers its own. The decision to fire slightly longer-range Western weapons is a difference of degree, not of kind.
For more than a year, Kyiv has used British Storm Shadows to strike Crimea, which Russia has occupied since 2014. For months, Kyiv has been allowed to fire ATACMS at Russian targets in occupied Ukraine. By law, Russia considers these territories its own, and warned of dire consequences if Ukraine targeted them with Western weaponry.
Since May, Washington has also allowed Kyiv to use shorter-range American rockets to strike targets in Russia across the border from Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region. Before President Joe Biden green-lighted that decision, Putin made similar nuclear threats, warning the move could lead to “serious consequences” for “small and densely populated countries.” It did not.
“Again and again, we prove that when you cross a fake red line – nothing really happens,” said Alberque. Still, he said the threats were enough to prevent the West from giving Ukraine what it needed to defend itself.
Although the threats have yet again intensified following last week’s developments, Albuquerque said there is little reason to suspect that this time really is different. The prospect of an incoming Donald Trump administration – long assumed to be Putin’s desired outcome – means Russia is even less likely than usual to make good on its threats.
“The (risk) that they’re suddenly going to do something that would risk actual intervention by the United States or by NATO allies – or would fundamentally change global attitudes towards the conflict – is relatively low,” said Alberque.",['Christian Edwards'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/28/europe/putin-trump-intelligent-experienced-russia-ukraine-intl-latam/index.html,"Russian President Vladimir Putin says Trump is ‘intelligent and experienced,’ capable of finding ‘solutions’",2024-11-28 00:00:00,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday praised US President-elect Donald Trump as an “intelligent and experienced” politician capable of finding “solutions,” as tensions between Moscow and the West ramp up over the war in Ukraine.
Speaking to reporters in Kazakhstan, Putin castigated President Joe Biden for creating “additional difficulties” for the incoming Trump administration, after Biden gave Ukraine permission to fire longer-range American missiles, called ATACMS, at targets deep inside Russia.
The Russian president also threatened to strike Ukraine again with a nuclear-capable ballistic missile, called “Oreshnik,” following Moscow’s widespread overnight attack Wednesday targeting critical energy infrastructure facilities.
Asked whether Biden’s decision would impact future relations between Moscow and Washington, Putin suggested things could improve after Trump takes office in January.
“As far as I can imagine, the newly elected president is an intelligent and already quite experienced person. I think he will find a solution,” Putin said.
Putin’s congenial tone is in marked contrast with the Kremlin’s threats against the outgoing Biden administration, which Putin accused of “escalating” the war in Ukraine by allowing Kyiv to fire ATACMS at military targets in Russia.
Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine “within 24 hours,” without saying how. During the election campaign, he repeatedly refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war.
Putin’s comments come after Trump on Wednesday nominated Gen. Keith Kellogg to be special envoy to the warring countries. “Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!” Trump wrote on social media, announcing his pick.
Speaking from the sidelines of a security summit in the Kazakh capital Astana, Putin said Trump had overcome a “serious test” to return to the White House, referring to the two assassination attempts against him during the election campaign.
Trump was wounded in the first attempt in Pennsylvania in July. In a separate incident in September, a man was charged with attempted assassination after camping out at one of Trump’s Florida golf courses while armed with a rifle.
Putin said “absolutely uncivilized means of struggle were used against Trump” more than once, adding that he fears the president-elect is not currently safe.
He also criticized the “humiliating, unfounded judicial procedures” to which Trump was “subjected” during the campaign. In June, a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial, making him the first former US president to be convicted of a felony.
Discussing the war in Ukraine, Putin also threatened more launches of Russia’s new medium-range ballistic missile which was used to attack Ukraine’s Dnipro region last week. The new missile, called Oreshnik, fires multiple warheads at once, and is capable of delivering a nuclear payload.
“We will use the means at our disposal,” he warned. “We do not exclude the use of Oreshnik against the (Ukrainian) military, against military industrial facilities, or against decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, bearing in mind that the Kyiv authorities today continue to attempt to strike our vital facilities.”
Asked to clarify if the “decision-making centers” the Kremlin warned it might hit are military or political, Putin replied: “You know, in Soviet times there was a joke about weather forecasts? Here’s the forecast: today, during the day, anything is possible.”","['Christian Edwards', 'Darya Tarasova', 'Lauren Kent']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/27/europe/ukraine-drones-russian-advances-pokrovsk-intl/index.html,Ukraine is relying on drones to hold back Russian advances. Troops on the frontline are fearing the worst,2024-11-27 11:17:01,"The Russian assault, caught in grainy feeds from multiple drones, is relentless and daily. Aging armored vehicles race across a pockmarked field. Then, in broad daylight, one tank is stopped by Ukrainian attack drones. Yet two vehicles make it to the treeline and drop off Russian troops to shelter in the scant winter foliage. Minutes later, more drones strike the lone dismounts.
Another tank, partially damaged in its first run, continues through the treeline ahead. It breaks into the next open field, with some troops apparently clinging still to its battered exterior. The sight and its bloodshed are perversely intimate in the live detail, even though the horror we are watching is about 10 miles away.
Once the tank is halfway across the next field, the swarm of single-use drones strikes it again and it slows to a smoking halt. However much of each assault they kill, the Ukrainians complain, the few Russians who advance are immediately reinforced by another 10.
Ukraine cannot match Moscow’s numbers, or a tolerance for casualties that Western officials claim is resulting in up to 1,200 dead or injured daily across the frontlines. Kyiv’s manpower crisis has been palpable in Pokrovsk for weeks, soldiers around the eastern front told CNN, and Moscow’s savage tactics are seeing persistent success.
“The situation is very critical,” said East, the callsign of a commander of a drone unit working around Pokrovsk. “We lack infantry to fight and hold out for some time while the drones do their work. That’s why we often see situations where the enemy uncontrollably penetrates vulnerable areas.”
Troops in Pokrovsk told CNN of manpower shortages so acute they feared Russia could make a significant breakthrough and complained of having to use drones to strike advancing Russian units because they lacked infantry to confront them.
One commander said Selydove, a key town outside of Pokrovsk taken by Russia in October, was defended with only six Ukrainian positions, which he assessed meant about 60 troops were involved in the operation. They were quickly encircled, outnumbered and retreated with significant casualties.
It is rare to hear Ukrainian troops disparage commanders and starkly assess the frontline to reporters, but multiple soldiers around Pokrovsk presented a stark assessment of the current Russian offensive and their own prospects in the area over the coming months.
The upcoming presidency of Donald Trump causes some anxiety: troops were keen to not offend the incoming US commander in chief and also concerned about the fate of their fight. “I will hold back, as I talk straight,” said one soldier. Another feared a January peace initiative after Trump’s inauguration might be too late.
“I cannot say exactly how much time we have, if there is any time at all,” said Kashei, a callsign, a reconnaissance sniper. “Now they are pushing their troops to the frontline as much as possible. And then at one point they will all go for an assault. They can go very far. In one day, let’s say.
“The enemy is advancing because there are no people defending on the ground,” he continued. “Nobody wants to sit there. There is a very high chance that they will not come back.”
The drone crew skip through their video library of the past weeks’ costly and chaotic withdrawals. There is the moment when three Ukrainian troops walk into a factory in Selydove a month earlier, advised it is under Ukrainian control, only for one of them to be shot down by Russians occupying the building.
Another scene involves a Ukrainian drone unit defending another village, mostly without infantry support, encircled by Russian troops. The footage shows a Russian soldier hiding nearby and the unit firing a drone – usually sent kilometers toward the front – just 30 meters (98 feet) away to hit the approaching Russians.
Recruitment brings its own issues. The defense of Selydove, one commander said, was bolstered by 300 fresh recruits, sent to the frontline directly and expected to undergo basic training in the trenches. Errors by command are increasing, several soldiers said, sharing an episode in which a unit of Ukrainian soldiers was attacked by drones on the frontline, after two Ukrainian commanders mistakenly failed to identify them.
Mistakes are commonplace in the chaos and horror of a battlefield, yet this openness and candor is rare from troops who a year earlier would have spoken with fierce pride about Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive in Russia’s Kursk region.
“I have no people. I’m f**king alone. I’m f**king tired,” said Kotia, a callsign, another reconnaissance sniper. “I love my job, but we need other young people to love this job too. Our country is awake, but people in it are not. Guys are dying here. This is trash.”
The prospect of peace talks beginning when Trump takes power in January provided little consolation. “Freezing this war is a double-edged sword,” Kotia said. “Do we give up the land my friends died for, or to continue taking it back and lose even more friends. If these two old men (Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin) start measuring d*cks, Ukraine will be the middle of it all. That won’t be pleasant.”
East, the drone commander, said he was assigned to the area in August. “During this time, we have never gone to the training grounds or replenished our personnel,” he said. The Russians “are constantly staffed, constantly trained, there are certain rotations, replenishment of personnel. We constantly hear about it from intercepts, that they have replacements and rotations.”
The intensity of the Russian assault against Pokrovsk is felt in multiple directions. One Russian push heads to its south, around the smaller town of Kurakhove, where the remaining Ukrainian troops risk being cut off by a Russian “pincer” movement to the south and north.
Other Russian assault units are pushing fast towards Pokrovsk itself, with infantry units, sometimes only a few Russians strong, probing into villages and looking for holes in Ukraine’s increasingly porous defenses. One commander told CNN that troops around Pokrovsk had been ordered to shoot unidentified persons on sight, in fear of Russian reconnaissance groups advancing.
The brutality of the Russian assault also batters morale. A drone video circulating shows a small house on the edges of Petrivka, a village close to Pokrovsk, on November 13. The footage shows a local in an orange shirt, guiding advancing Russian troops to a basement where Ukrainian soldiers were hiding.
One by one, the Ukrainians are led out into the daylight and forced at gunpoint to lie face down. The video then shows one soldier apparently fire at the prone Ukrainians, the leg of one twitching after the gunfire.
The Ukrainian prosecutor general said on Tuesday it had launched an investigation into the incident as “a war crime combined with premeditated murder,” adding: “In violation of international humanitarian law, the occupiers shot the Ukrainian prisoners with automatic weapons. The killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a grave international crime.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/27/politics/trump-national-security-adviser-proposals-end-russia-ukraine-war/index.html,Trump’s national security adviser pick is weighing proposals to end the Russia-Ukraine war,2024-11-27 19:34:16,"President-elect Donald Trump’s soon-to-be national security adviser Mike Waltz has been weighing several proposals in recent days for ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, including one from Gen. Keith Kellogg who Trump announced Wednesday as his pick to be to be special envoy to the countries, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN
While the specifics of a strategy are still being worked on, Trump officials will likely push for a ceasefire early on to freeze the conflict temporarily while both sides negotiate, the people said. Trump administration officials are also expected to push for European allies and NATO to take on more of the cost-sharing burden for supporting Ukraine.
“We need to bring this to a responsible end,” Waltz told Fox over the weekend. “We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it.”
Prior to winning the election, Trump repeatedly claimed that the Russia-Ukraine war would not have started if he had been president. He also vowed to end the war, sometimes even claiming he would stop the years-long conflict before taking office. In July, he said he could settle the conflict in one day.
In his September presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump refused to say he was committed to Ukraine defeating Russia. Later that month, he suggested that Ukraine should have “given up a little bit” to Moscow, saying at a campaign event that “any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”
The plans Waltz is reviewing include a proposal from Kellogg, who served as an adviser on national security issues in the first Trump administration.
“I am very pleased to nominate General Keith Kellogg to serve as Assistant to the President and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Keith has led a distinguished Military and Business career, including serving in highly sensitive National Security roles in my first Administration. He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!” Trump posted.
The Kellogg plan calls for continued US military aid to Ukraine to be conditioned on Kyiv participating in peace talks with Russia and “a formal US policy to seek a cease-fire and negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict.” Ukraine’s desire to join NATO, meanwhile, would be “put off” for an extended period to draw Russia to the table.
Waltz has also reviewed a separate proposal that has been endorsed by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell.
Grenell has previously expressed support for the creation of “autonomous regions” inside Ukraine, though he has not explained in detail what that would look like.
“Autonomous regions can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but you got to work through those details,” he told Bloomberg in July.
Another idea being floated is to allow Russia to keep the territory it holds now in exchange for Ukraine getting NATO membership, though few people in Trump’s orbit appear eager to invite Ukraine into NATO anytime soon, the people said. That’s a view at least partly shared by the Biden administration, which has said that Ukraine will join NATO but only when the war is over.
Ukraine was among a range of issues Waltz discussed with Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan during a meeting last week.
A Trump transition spokesman said the president-elect is committed to ending the war.
“As President Trump has said on the campaign trail, he is the only person who can bring both sides together in order to negotiate peace, and work towards ending the war and stopping the killing,” Trump communications director Steven Cheung said.
‘Too early to say’ what ultimate strategy will look like
Still, sources caution that it is “too early” to say what the Trump team’s strategy for ending the war in Ukraine will ultimately look like.
Trump, himself, is always altering his positions and messaging tactics – particularly on foreign policy issues – meaning the planning process as it relates to Ukraine will likely be fluid, one source familiar with internal transition discussions noted.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this month that “from our side, we must do everything so that this war ends next year, ends through diplomatic means.” But he has also lambasted the idea of implementing a ceasefire without security guarantees first from the West.
“Ceasefire? We tried that in 2014, we tried to reach it and then we lost Crimea and then we had the full-scale war in 2022,” Zelensky said at a conference in Budapest earlier this month.
Zelensky, who met with Trump in New York in September, told reporters in Budapest that “I believe that President Trump really wants a quick decision” to end the war. “He [Trump] wants this war to be finished. We all want to end this war, but a fair ending. … If it is very fast, it’s going to be a loss for Ukraine.”
Trump allies tapped to serve in top national security roles have already signaled publicly that the President-elect is considering a range of options to bring both Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table – including some that appear to contradict his previously stated views on the conflict.
Sebastian Gorka, who Trump recently named to serve as one of Waltz’s top deputies, recently called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “thug” and said the incoming administration could ramp up US military aid to Ukraine, beyond the current level of support, in an effort to bring about a swift end to the war.
“I will give one tip away that the president has mentioned, he will say to that murderous former KGB colonel, that thug who runs the Russian federation, you will negotiate now or the aid we have given to Ukraine thus far will look like peanuts. That’s how he will force those gentlemen to come to an arrangement that stops the bloodshed,” Gorka said during a recent interview on Times Radio.
At the same time, top Trump officials anticipate the president-elect will want to take a similarly hard line toward Ukraine and could threaten to withhold aid if they do not come to the negotiating table, according to a source familiar with ongoing discussions about ending the war.
In recent weeks, the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use US-made long-range missiles to strike targets deep within Russia. For months, Zelensky publicly lobbied the US to green light the use of the ATACMS missiles, but the US only relented in mid-November.
The decision came a short time after the administration lifted a de facto ban on US contractors working in Ukraine in order to more quickly repair advanced systems like F-16 fighter jets and Patriot missile defense systems.","['Natasha Bertrand', 'Zachary Cohen']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/27/politics/pentagon-billions-ukraine-aid/index.html,"Pentagon unlikely to use all of the billions Congress authorized it to spend on Ukraine weapons before Biden leaves office, officials say",2024-11-27 21:48:01,"The Pentagon is unlikely to use all of the billions of dollars authorized by Congress to arm Ukraine before President Joe Biden leaves office, according to two US officials and three defense officials.
The administration has less than two months left to use nearly $7 billion, part of a larger package authorized by Congress earlier this year to help Ukraine in the war with Russia. The funding allows the Defense Department to draw from its own stockpiles to send weapons, but shortages have limited how much the US can send to Kyiv in recent months.
For months, the US has run into the limits of its ability to replenish its own weapons inventories, which limited what the Biden administration has been able to send Ukraine. The US has been growing its capacity to produce critical munitions, such as 155mm artillery shells, since virtually the beginning of the war nearly three years ago, but the ramp up in production is not yet complete.
The Pentagon had pledged to use all of the remaining authority to provide the military aid as the situation has grown more urgent given the size of Russian attacks on Ukraine, including the recent first-time use of an intermediate-range ballistic missile with multiple warheads.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.
Last week, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said the administration is “committed to using the full authority that Congress has allotted to us.”
State Department officials briefed Congress this month that the administration is still working to allocate the remaining funds, according to a congressional source familiar with the matter. But with only 55 days left until President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the US still has $6.8 billion left in authority to ship weapons directly from US inventories to Ukraine.
Trump is unlikely to continue providing the same level support to Kyiv, and CNN reported Wednesday that his pick to be national security adviser, Mike Waltz, is weighing several proposals to end a war that the president-elect claimed on the campaign trail he could end in one day.
In the time the administration has left, one defense official said the size of the individual military aid packages is likely to increase but acknowledged using the remaining funds within such a short time is “going to be a challenge.”
US official says Ukraine should lower recruiting age to 18
Earlier Wednesday, a senior Biden administration official said Ukraine should lower the recruiting age for its military to 18 years old from where it currently stands at 25, calling the need “critical.”
The official argued that the most urgent need is not weapons but fresh manpower to train so that current troops can be rotated out and those who have been killed can be replaced.
“As you look at the battlefront and the needs, the progress that the Russians have made, particularly in the east, the physics of it, the pure math of it is you need bodies,” said the official. “You need manpower. You need soldiers.”
The US has been able to authorize military aid packages totaling approximately $750 million per month recently, according to one US official. This fall, DoD increased the size of the military aid packages at the request of Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, the official said.
“We’re basically trying to do everything we can to leave everything on the table and put Ukraine in the strongest position,” the official said.
Now, the administration is working to increase that amount to about $1 billion per month in the time remaining, a second US official said, but that will still leave billions unused.
Both officials said there are still large quantities of weapons and equipment that will arrive in Ukraine before the start of the Trump administration on January 20, including hundreds of air defense missiles. Then it will be up to the new administration to decide whether to continue to flow weapons to Kyiv or use the remaining authority to send new military aid packages.
In September, Biden committed billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine as President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House. But the US was not able to send all of the aid at once, instead breaking it down into smaller packages announced approximately every two weeks.
“As part of the surge in security assistance that President Biden announced on September 26, the Department remains committed to providing Ukraine with the capabilities it needs to fight Russian aggression through the end of the Administration,” a defense official told CNN.
The Biden administration has continued to announce military aid packages twice a month, but the US is still far short of the pace required to use the remaining money. In the previous two months, the US announced a total of $1.9 billion in Ukraine assistance across five different aid packages, a number that would have to triple to use what’s left to give from the Biden administration. The last package, announced on November 20, was worth $275 million and included much-needed artillery rounds and drones.
Biden led a concerted effort to convince some skeptical Republicans in Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, to pass a supplemental funding bill in April that included $61 billion in aid for Ukraine.
“It’s going to make America safer. It’s going to make the world safer. And it continues America’s leadership in the world,” Biden said upon signing the bill on April 24. The US announced a $1 billion military aid package for Ukraine that same day.","['Oren Liebermann', 'Natasha Bertrand', 'Katie Bo Lillis', 'Alex Marquardt']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/asia/north-korea-missile-plant-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html,"North Korea expands weapons plant that makes missiles used by Russia against Ukraine, researchers say",2023-08-13 00:00:00,"North Korea is expanding a weapons plant that manufactures missiles used by Russia against Ukraine, according to new research from a US-based think tank.
The facility produces both KN-23 missiles (Hwasong-11A) and KN-24 missiles (Hwasong-11B), according to researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.
Located in the country’s second-largest city, Hamhung, the factory has been visited several times by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with North Korean state media previously touting its mass-production of tactical missiles.
Ukraine has been hit by a recent surge in Russian ballistic missile attacks, about a third of which used North Korean weapons, according to Ukrainian military officials.
Moscow and Pyongyang have also deepened their military ties to a level unseen since the Cold War, including agreeing to a mutual defense pact earlier this year and sending North Korean troops to help fight against Ukraine according to Western and South Korean officials.
Now, new satellite images indicate North Korea is expanding the Hamhung facility and building what appears to be a second building for the final assembly of missiles, as well as additional housing for workers.
“It seems like this is an attempt to increase the throughput on that production line that they’ve established,” Sam Lair, a research associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, told CNN.
Lair said researchers have seen a lot of expansion at the facility, which is called the ‘February 11 plant’ by North Korean authorities, in the last few years alone. The size of the plant started to increase in 2020, and it has since undergone routine improvements like repairing old buildings and replacing roofs, he said.
But the new building, likely intended for missile assembly, indicates “that they’re not just improving an element of the production line, but rather, they’re trying to expand it.”
North Korea also appears to be scaling up the size of the workforce at the facility, Lair told CNN, based on his analysis of the images taken in October by satellite firm Planet Labs.
“Just outside the security perimeter of the factory, we see what appear to be new apartment buildings going up,” he said. “We can see the foundations in satellite imagery.”
The new missile assembly building is roughly 60% to 70% as large as the original building, Lair estimates.
State media footage from KCNA shows Kim Jong Un touring the plant in August 2023, showing off tail kits being added to Hwasong-11 class missiles, nozzles being fitted and nose cones capping off the short-range ballistic missiles, according to researchers. But that footage has since been removed from state media websites.
The factory is part of the Ryongsong Machine Complex, which also manufactures goods like multiple rocket launcher shells for the North Korean military, Lair said.
Attacks on Ukraine with KN-23 missiles
Russia has fired about 60 North Korean KN-23 missiles (Hwasong-11A) at Ukraine this year.
And strikes using North Korean missiles have killed at least 28 people and injured 213 this year, the Ukrainian prosecutor general told CNN last week.
CNN has previously reported on the apparent extent of US- and European-made or designed circuitry in the guidance systems of KN-23 missiles, which North Korea obtains despite sanctions.
Crucial components used in the missiles are produced by nine Western manufacturers, including companies based in the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, according to a recent report by Ukraine’s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO), a civil society organization.
Moscow and Pyongyang have both previously denied that North Korea has exported weapons to Russia, despite significant evidence of such transfers. Meanwhile, observers have raised concerns that Moscow may be violating international sanctions to aid Pyongyang’s development of its military satellite program.
In June, the two autocratic nations signed a new landmark defense pact, pledging to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
Western officials have also warned that thousands of North Korean troops have joined Moscow’s forces in its attempt to seize back the Kursk region that was taken by Kyiv’s military in a surprise offensive earlier this year.

Russian state media outlet TASS said the man was 22-year-old James Scott Rhys Anderson, a former British soldier, citing a military source.
The British Foreign Office confirmed it was “supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention.”
In a video circulating on Russian media, a man identifies himself as James Scott Rhys Anderson and said had previously fought in the British Army before flying to Poland and taking a bus to the Ukrainian border. It is not clear whether he was speaking under duress.
The man says he was born in May 2002. He sits in front of a dark background and appears to respond to questions about his background and why he chose to fight for Ukraine. The video is heavily edited, with sharp cuts in various places.
People of various nationalities, often former soldiers, have fought against Russian forces in Ukraine’s International Legion, bolstering Kyiv’s armed forces in the conflict.
Kyiv launched an incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August, taking Moscow and even its own allies by surprise. It said at the time that the operation was necessary because Russia had been planning to launch a new attack on Ukraine from the region. It said it was aiming to create a “buffer zone” to prevent future cross-border attacks.
The Kursk offensive was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II.
Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to Kursk in response. A US official told CNN that Russia has amassed a large force of tens of thousands in the region, including recently arrived North Korean troops.

Colonel General Gennady Anashkin, the commander of the South Forces Group, was dismissed after providing misleading information about Russia’s progress near the Siversk settlement in the eastern region of Donetsk, according to the bloggers.
Russian media RBC reported Anashkin’s removal, citing unnamed sources within the Russian Ministry of Defense who said he was removed as part of a planned rotation. There has been no official confirmation from Russian officials.
Ukrainian forces are facing “one of the most powerful Russian offensives” since the start of the war on the frontlines, according to Ukraine’s army chief.
But progress has been slower in some regions, with many settlements becoming “synonymous with lies and unjustified losses,” Rybar, one of the most prominent Russian military blogs, said on Telegram.
“Only the lazy did not write about the problems there: in general, it took the system about two months to respond to it properly,” Rybar added, referring to multiple settlements near the frontline that Anashkin allegedly lied about capturing.
Some bloggers claim that false reports made by several commanders about the situation on the ground have led to heavy losses among Russian units.
Military bloggers have become a key source of information since Russian’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Many have deep sources within the state’s armed forces or among pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The experimental strike Thursday marked a decisive moment in Moscow’s war and capped off a dramatic week that has transformed the conflict. The firing of the missile came after the White House authorized Ukraine to fire its long-range missiles into Russia.
In a televised meeting with the leadership of Russia’s defense ministry, Putin claimed the missile could not be intercepted by air defenses and said Russia will begin serial production of the new weapon.
“There are currently no means of countering such a missile, no means of intercepting it, in the world. And I will emphasize once again: We will continue testing the latest system,” Putin said.
Putin added Russia was developing “several similar systems” for further testing.
“Based on the test results, these weapons will also go into production. That is, we are developing a whole line of medium- and shorter-range systems,” he said.
Putin’s comments come a day after Russia fired the “Oreshnik” missile – which contains multiple warheads – at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, saying in a video posted on Telegram that “today, our crazy neighbor has once again shown who he really is and how he despises dignity, freedom and human life in general.”
Zelensky said Friday that Ukraine was holding meetings with its allies about developing “new air defense systems” in response to the new threat from Russia.
Two US officials and one Western official told CNN that the “experimental” ballistic missile carried multiple warheads, in what may be the first time such a weapon has been used in war.
Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a key ally of Ukraine, said the conflict was “entering a decisive phase.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/23/europe/ukraine-north-korean-missile-attacks-western-components-intl/index.html,Ukraine is being hit with a surge of attacks using North Korean missiles. Western components help make it possible,2024-11-23 05:01:48,"Ukraine has been hit by a surge in Russian ballistic missile attacks, about a third of which used North Korean weapons that can only fly because they run on Western circuitry, obtained despite sanctions, according to Ukrainian military officials.
Russia has fired about 60 North Korean KN-23 missiles at Ukraine this year, according to a Ukrainian defense official. That accounts for nearly one in three of the 194 ballistic missiles fired so far in 2024, a CNN tally of attacks publicly acknowledged by Ukraine’s air force shows.
August and September saw a spike in ballistic missile attacks, when Ukraine first publicly detailed the use of the KN-23.
“We see that since the spring, Russia has been using ballistic missiles and attack drones much more to strike Ukraine. And less use of cruise missiles,” the acting head of communications of the Ukrainian Air Force, Yuriy Ignat, told CNN.
These less-sophisticated missiles are part of North Korea’s growing support to Moscow, which also includes about 11,000 North Korean soldiers deployed to Russia’s Kursk region.
As the expanding role of the North Korean missiles becomes clear, Ukrainian officials have given CNN rare access to fragments from the wreckage of the weapons, which show the apparent extent of US- and European-made or designed circuitry in their guidance systems.
Crucial components used in the North Korean missiles are produced by nine Western manufacturers, including companies based in the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, according to a recent report by Ukraine’s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO), a civil society organization. Some parts of the KN-23/24 missiles they analyzed were produced as recently as 2023, suggesting a swift delivery pipeline to North Korea.
CNN was shown around one warehouse where Ukrainian government investigators comb through the debris, searching for small details that offer clues about the production of these deadly weapons.
The warehouse was full of damaged drones and burned missile parts. In different buildings, hundreds of microchips were carefully separated into folders named for various weapons used by Russia – “Shahed,” “Iskander,” and “KN-23.”
It’s a somber site, as investigators are keenly aware the components were salvaged from the rubble of buildings where lives were lost. Strikes using North Korean missiles have killed at least 28 people and injured 213 this year, the Ukrainian prosecutor general told CNN.
“Everything that works to guide the missile, to make it fly, is all foreign components. All the electronics are foreign. There is nothing Korean in it,” said Andriy Kulchytskyi, head of the Military Research Laboratory of Kyiv’s Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Expertise.
“The only thing Korean is the metal, which quickly rusts and corrodes,” he added.
A Ukrainian Defense Intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said their investigations are hampered by the damage to the missile fragments, but it’s still possible to determine that “the vast majority of components are Western components. Probably 70% are American, from well-known companies […] They also use components made in Germany and Switzerland.”
A report released earlier this year by the UK-based investigative organization Conflict Armament Research, or CAR, found that 75% of components in one of the first North Korean missiles used to attack Ukraine were from US-based companies.
Sanctioned goods move though China
There is no reliable information on how exactly the components make their way into North Korea, according to weapons-tracing experts. But all signs to point to China as the likely conduit, experts say.
“We have successfully traced some of those components, and the last known custodians are Chinese companies,” said Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations at CAR, which works to independently document diverted weapons. That means Chinese firms bought the components from manufacturers and a series of intermediaries.
“The diversion rarely happens at the plant that makes the components,” he told CNN.
CAR has a policy of not “naming and shaming” specific manufacturers because there is no evidence the firms deliberately shipped the parts to North Korea.
“Some parts of these components may be actually fake and made in China,” said Victoria Vyshnivska, a senior researcher at NAKO. “But we cannot be 100% sure,” she added, as the companies in question often failed to respond to questions.
One manufacturer was able to provide NAKO with evidence that a low-value electronic component found in a North Korean missile was counterfeit.
Meanwhile, Vyshnivska said, some other manufacturers are choosing not to pursue better control of their exports, as more detailed record-keeping and company audits would incur costs. “It’s ignorance that is sometimes, maybe, driven by money,” she told CNN.
CAR and others consider that middleman distribution companies – not manufacturers – are the primary issue.
There are more than 250 companies whose components have been identified in North Korean missiles, according to CAR. But the majority of those electronics are sold to five main distributors, which are all based in the United States and Canada. CAR is urging policymakers to focus more effort on regulating those distribution companies.
The US Commerce Department has already stepped up its targeting of entities and shell companies that have shipped sanctioned goods to Russia and Belarus.
Ukrainian officials argue the poor enforcement of the sanctions regime by Western nations is one major issue.
Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president’s commissioner for sanctions policy, said he was hopeful the incoming Trump administration would seek greater control over the illicit trade.
“No manufacturers’ entities have been held responsible for any of these supplies yet,” he told CNN. “We think that if any of these … manufacturers would be held responsible for the quantity of microelectronics found, say, in Russian missiles hitting Ukraine, (they) would really, really start to do more in that regard.”
That echoes the sentiment of the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which earlier this year slammed US manufacturers for not doing enough to vet potential buyers, despite having adequate “resources, funding, and knowledge.”
“Our findings reveal a distinct disinterest in evaluating and improving corporate compliance practices and particularly, monitoring those distributors, the middlemen,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) in September.
Components also continue to be diverted to Iran and to Russia directly, according to the Ukrainian intelligence official.
“Russia uses Western components in the whole segment of both lethal weapons and reconnaissance drones,” the Defense Intelligence official told CNN, noting that the downing of one of Russia’s heavy drones, the “Okhotnik,” revealed it was primarily made from American components. “We also need to do the appropriate work to close these supply channels,” he said.","['Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'Lauren Kent', 'Nick Paton Walsh', 'Victoria Butenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/22/world/dramatic-week-transforms-war-ukraine-intl/index.html,"From a call with Putin to an experimental strike, a dramatic week transforms the war in Ukraine",2024-11-21 00:00:00,"It began with a peace move nobody wanted and ended with an experimental missile strike so rare in war Moscow gave a 30-minute heads-up to Washington.
The past seven days have fundamentally changed Ukraine’s long conflict, and at a breakneck pace ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. The week marks a seismic escalation that nevertheless risks fading fast in the fatigue swamping the war, so it is worthy of a recap.
The White House publicly authorized Ukraine Sunday to fire missiles it supplied into Russia proper, which it swiftly did Monday. Moscow responded by using an experimental medium-range missile, with hypersonic speeds and a multiple warhead system usually reserved for nuclear payloads, to strike Dnipro Thursday. Putin claimed the “Oreshnik” could evade all Western air defense.
Both sides dubbed each other reckless - and by sides, I mean the US and Russia. For this is fast becoming a war where Washington desperately seeks to alter Ukraine’s downward curve on the front lines, and Russia, the aggressor here from the start, edges towards riskier ways of restoring the deterrent value they have lost in the last three years.
Neither is likely to get into direct conflict with the other, but instead become more intimately involved in Ukraine’s increasingly global fight.
It is a rapid deterioration. Seven days ago, fury surrounded unexpected talk of peace.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz unilaterally rang Russian President Vladimir Putin, ending a two-year isolation of the Kremlin head from major Western leaders. Scholz was seeking to curry favor with pro-Russian voters in eastern Germany ahead of a general election, but justified his call by saying that if Trump was going to talk to Moscow, Europe should too. Ukraine and Poland were publicly angry; France and the UK seemed to more quietly seethe.
It is unlikely the White House decision on weapons stemmed from Scholz’s call, and indeed it said President Joe Biden’s reversal of months of delay over approving the missile use inside Russia was fueled by North Korean troops joining Russia’s ranks. Similarly, Putin’s decision to launch the Oreshnik missile was likely Moscow stepping up another rung on a carefully prepared ladder of escalation. Moscow and Washington have telegraphed these moves for months, even if they are still a little taken aback on how their adversary actually made them this week.
The exact specifics of the Oreshnik seem key to Putin’s message. A lot remains unclear, but most assessments, and Putin’s own comments, agree this is a new missile, likely hypersonic, not nuclear (this time), but able to deliver multiple warheads in a fashion normally reserved for nuclear payloads. Putin said that at 3 km per second, its speed meant all Western air defenses were useless. US and NATO officials called the device medium-range and “experimental,” comments that initially sound like they sought to downplay its significance but may actually point to a wider rift with Moscow.
In 2019, President Trump pulled out of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, the landmark act limiting the development of such weapons, accusing Russia of violating it. Western officials’ insistence this missile - which appeared nuclear capable - was “intermediate” in range, was perhaps a nod to Russia’s continued pursuit of such weapons outside of the now defunct INF. Perhaps this was a nod to Trump too that Moscow has been busy making the weapons his first term claimed they were.
Ukraine deemed the device the “Kedr”, apparently first alluded to in Russian state media in 2021. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s defense intelligence, said Friday it was a “medium-range ballistic missile, a nuclear weapons carrier. The fact that they used it in a non-nuclear version… is a warning that they have completely lost their minds.” Budanov said Ukraine assessed that two prototypes of the Kedr were made by October, but insisted “it is not a serial product, thank God.”
The weeks ahead will show if the Oreshnik is a singular message or a new tactic. Its use injected some greater anxiety in Kyiv, after the snap closure of the US Embassy Wednesday citing an aerial threat, fueling the fear Moscow is reaching for tools in its kit that it had kept for a final existential fight with a great power.
Yet the week’s most troubling news is perhaps away from the loud geopolitical brawling and ominous fireworks over Dnipro.
The United Kingdom’s Defence Intelligence, normally a staunch advocate of the Ukrainian military, said Thursday the front line was more “unstable” than at any time since the invasion. That is a euphemism for Kyiv’s forces struggling across the front and matches the persistently gloomy reports CNN has had from military and open sources.
It is bleak in every direction. South of Kharkiv, Russia is advancing near the city of Kupiansk. Supply lines are at threat around the eastern Donbas region. Even southern Zaporizhzhia seems under greater pressure, and Moscow is persistently trying to push Ukraine out of its Kursk border region.
The Biden administration may rush in anti-personnel mines and announce more ammunition, but the changes are happening right now, across trenches where snow is settling. They look set, in the most optimistic reading, to at least give Moscow the upper hand territorially for a bleak winter.
Trump’s presidency expedited talk of talks. Yet the immediate response has been a headlong rush to exacerbate the hot war ahead of its possible freeze. The acute risk is this lurch forwards to a better negotiating position, develops an unstoppable momentum of its own.

Here’s what we know,2024-11-21 00:00:00,"Russia launched a new non-nuclear ballistic missile with medium range on Ukraine’s Dnipro region on Thursday, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said in a televised statement, marking another significant escalation in the 1,000-day-old war.
According to US and Western officials, the ballistic missile carried multiple warheads, which may be the first time such a weapon has been used in war.
At least three people were injured in the attack, the head of the Dnipro’s military administration had said earlier. A number of buildings were also damaged.
Here’s what we know.
What is Russia saying?
Russian President Vladimir Putin said a Russian strike in Ukraine was carried out by a new non-nuclear ballistic missile, which has a medium range.
“In response to the use of American and British long-range weapons, on November 21 of this year the Russian armed forces launched a combined strike on one of the facilities of the Ukrainian defense industry,” Putin said in a televised statement on Thursday.
“In combat conditions, one of the newest Russian medium-range missile systems was also tested,” Putin said, apparently referring to the strike on Dnipro. “In this case, with a ballistic missile in non-nuclear hypersonic equipment. Our missilemen called it ‘Oreshnik.’ The tests were successful. The launch goal was achieved.”
This comes after a US official told CNN earlier on Thursday that Russia used an “experimental medium-range” ballistic missile in an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.
A medium-range missile can travel between 1,000 kilometers and 3,000 kilometers (620 miles to 1,860 miles), according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.
Putin also said that Moscow considers itself entitled to use weapons against military targets belonging to countries that allow their weapons to be used against Russia. He said that Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked targets in Russia’s Bryansk region with six US-made ATACMS missiles on Tuesday and later fired British/French Storm Shadow systems on the Kursk region.
“From that moment, as we have repeatedly emphasized earlier, the regionally provoked conflict in Ukraine took on elements of a global nature,” Putin said, adding that “using such weapons without the direct involvement of military specialists from the countries that produce these weapons is impossible.”
“We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military objects of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our objects, and in the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond just as decisively and in kind,” he added.
What is Ukraine saying?
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia’s use of the new missile is “a clear and severe escalation in the scale and brutality of this war.”
In a post on X on Thursday, Zelensky accused Russia of “a cynical violation of the UN Charter” and taking a “second step toward escalation” of the conflict, adding that the first escalatory step was involving North Korean troops in the war.
The Ukrainian leader also emphasized Kyiv’s right to strike Russia with long-range weapons “under international law,” adding that Putin is “testing” Kyiv’s partners with his actions and called on world leaders to put pressure on Moscow.
“A lack of tough reactions to Russia’s actions sends a message that such behavior is acceptable,” he said. “Russia must be forced into real peace, which can only be achieved through strength.”
Ukraine’s foreign ministry echoed Zelensky’s comments, emphasizing Kyiv’s right to strike Russia with long-range weapons.
“Ukraine has used long-range capabilities against targets in its occupied territories many times, but Putin started to fuss only when targets in Russia were hit. So Putin knows the difference between the actual Russian territory and the territory he tries to steal from Ukraine,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said in a Thursday post on ‘X.’
Ukraine’s air force earlier accused Russia of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile at Dnipro at around 5 a.m. local time, from the Astrakhan region of southern Russia, without offering further detail. However, two Western officials disputed Ukraine’s assessment, saying that although the missile launched by Russia was likely a ballistic missile, it was not an intercontinental one.
Ukraine’s military also said that an X-47M2 Kinzhal ballistic missile was launched alongside seven cruise missiles in the attack, adding that all but one of the cruise missiles were shot down. “The other missiles didn’t cause significant consequences,” the military said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky framed the strike was evidence that Putin is “so afraid, he is already using new missiles.”
“Today, our crazy neighbor has once again shown who he really is and how he despises dignity, freedom, and human life in general,” Zelensky said in a video posted to Telegram before Putin’s televised address.
What is an MIRV?
The missile fired at Dnipro carried multiple warheads, according to two US officials and one Western official, in what may be the first time such a weapon has been used in war.
The weapon, known as a Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV), carries a series of warheads that can each target a specific location, allowing one ballistic missile to launch a larger attack.
MIRVs were developed during the Cold War to permit the delivery of multiple nuclear warheads with a single launch. The Minuteman III, which is the US intercontinental ballistic missile, is armed with MIRVs. The Russian missile attack on Dnipro was not armed with nuclear warheads, but it used a weapon designed for nuclear delivery to instead launch conventional weapons.
Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said this was the first use of the experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile “based on” Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh missile model, though Singh declined to identify the specific type of missile or its capabilities.
Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), says it’s likely the first time a MIRV has been used in combat.
In the past, MIRVS were “exclusively for nuclear warheads, and everything that’s more tactical is either singular or cluster munitions,” Karako told CNN.
The use of this type of missile armed with conventional warheads is an escalation of Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling, Karako said, which includes the recent update of its nuclear doctrine.
“This is a big rocket with payload capability - presumably MIRVs - and has the baggage associated with it of nuclear delivery vehicles,” he said.
Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said the launch was significant. “To my knowledge, yes, it’s the first time MIRV has been used in combat,” Kristensen said.
The United Nations Secretary General’s spokesperson warned on Thursday that Russia’s use of a new, medium-range ballistic missile is “yet another concerning and worrying development.”
“All of this [is] going in the wrong direction. What we want to see is for all parties to take urgent steps to de-escalate the situation,” Stephane Dujarric said in a regular briefing on Thursday, adding that “what we want to see is an end to this conflict in line with General Assembly resolutions, international law, and territorial integrity.”
Why is this significant?
Putin’s announcement comes during a tense week in the conflict, which is now more than 1,000 days old.
This week, both US and British/French-made missiles have been fired into Russia by Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to use longer-range American missiles across the border.
On Tuesday, Russia’s Defense Ministry and two US officials said Ukraine had fired the US-made ATACMS into Russia for the first time.
Russia’s Defense Ministry also said its air defenses shot down two British/French-made Storm Shadow missiles, acknowledging Ukraine’s use of the longer-range weapons.
In turn, Putin updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine, with the Kremlin saying the revised military doctrine would in theory lower the bar for first use of nuclear weapons.
How does Ukraine defend itself?
Ukraine uses a Patriot missile defense system supplied by the US and Germany to intercept incoming ballistic missile warheads, according to the Missile Threat Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The Patriot system is designed to engage incoming warheads, either with an exploding warhead of its own, or with kinetic interceptors – so-called “hit-to-kill” technology, which destroys the incoming warhead by striking it directly.
Patriot interceptors have a vertical range of about 20 kilometers (12 miles) and defend an area of about 15 to 20 kilometers around the battery, according to the Congressional Research Service.
But Ukraine has only a limited number of Patriots and batteries. Some cities, like the capital Kyiv, enjoy greater protection than others.
Why was Dnipro targeted?
The Dnipropetrovsk region has been a frequent target of Russian bombardment in recent months.
It borders the partially occupied Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions and has become a hub for people who have fled areas that are now under Russian control.
The region is now home to more than 400,000 internally displaced people. Dnipro, the fourth-largest city in Ukraine, is an important center of life in the eastern part of the country.
It is relatively close to the front lines, yet still fairly well protected by air defenses. That, plus its transportation infrastructure links to the rest of the country, makes the city a key hub in Ukraine’s war effort.
How much damage did the attack cause?
The head of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk military administration said Russia was “massively attacking” the region on Thursday morning.
Three people were injured after houses were damaged, and a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was also impacted in the attack, Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram.
There were two fires in Dnipro and “damage to an industrial enterprise,” he added.

Ukraine has accused Russia of launching an intercontinental missile in an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro today. If confirmed, it would be Moscow’s first use of the powerful long-range weapon in a war that has lasted more than 1,000 days. Russia may be “trying to send a message” to Kyiv’s Western backers in a week of creeping escalation, a military analyst said. In this week alone, President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to fire longer-range American missiles, known as ATACMS, at targets deep inside Russia. President Vladimir Putin then updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine. Ukraine also fired ATACMS into Russia for the first time. In another first, Ukraine launched the British-French-made Storm Shadow missile at targets inside Russia on Wednesday.
3. Hostages
The US has vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, on the grounds it would not have secured the release of hostages. US officials said the language in the resolution was not strong enough and failed to “condemn Hamas for its October 7 terrorist attack.” Seven American citizens are still being held in Gaza. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered $5 million and safe passage out of Gaza to anyone returning a hostage. His announcement was met with outrage from the mother of Matan Zangauker, one of the hostages still held in the enclave. She criticized Netanyahu for “offering money to Hamas” and said his attempt to “divide and rule in Gaza through bribes to the captors” would put the hostages at risk.
4. Google
The US government formally proposed a partial breakup of Google on Wednesday, urging a federal judge to force a sale of the company’s Chrome web browser after a landmark ruling this year found that Google had violated US antitrust law with its search business. The request by the Justice Department and a group of states opens the door to the most significant antitrust penalties for a tech giant in a generation, targeting not only Google’s illegal monopoly in search but also its growing ambitions in AI. If approved, the penalties could revolutionize how millions of Americans search for information and potentially disrupt the tight integration among many of Google’s key products and services. Google has promised to appeal.
5. Social media ban
The Australian government has proposed a ban on children under 16 from using social media and will hand down huge fines to companies who don’t comply. The ban is expected to apply to services including TikTok, X, Instagram and Snapchat, though a full list has not been released. The legislation follows several high-profile cases of bullying and complaints from parents worldwide about the pressure their children face to be online. Many pro-ban campaigners have lauded the bill as a long-overdue measure to hold tech companies accountable for their impact on children. However, critics say the proposed ban is a blunt instrument that will reduce teens’ access to support networks and create greater risks for those who defy the ban.

Ukraine’s use of the UK-supplied missiles to hit Russian territory was confirmed to Reuters by an official on condition of anonymity. British media also reported the use of the cruise missile on Wednesday, citing sources.
Ukraine’s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov refused to confirm or deny the use of the UK-French-made missiles during a Wednesday news conference. Nor did a spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defense when asked by CNN. CNN has reached out to the French Ministry of Defense for comment.
When Umerov was asked if Ukraine used the Storm Shadow missiles to hit a target inside Russia, he replied, “we are using all the means to defend our country, so we’ll not go into detail. But we are just sending that we are capable and able to respond.”
Umerov added: “We’ll be defending and giving punches back… with all the means available.”
A Russian military blogger on Wednesday posted photos on Telegram of a Storm Shadow missile fragment, claiming that up to 12 of the missiles were fired on Russia’s Kursk region.
According to the Russian blog, the fragment was photographed in the Russian village of Marino, which is about 35 miles from the Ukrainian border. The fragment has engravings that say “Storm Shadow.”
The fragments in the photo were confirmed to be from a Storm Shadow missile by weapons expert Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army, who reviewed the image for CNN. However, CNN was unable to verify that the Telegram image was taken on Wednesday.
A separate video posted on Telegram, which was verified and geolocated by CNN, shows explosions audible from the Russian village of Marino on Wednesday. A weapons expert who reviewed the video for CNN said there are no indications the explosions are from a different type of munition, but it’s not possible to definitively say they are from Storm Shadow missiles.
The UK and France have previously supplied the longer-range Storm Shadow missiles for Ukraine to use inside its own borders. The missiles have a range of about 250 kilometers (155 miles), which is slightly shorter than the range of the American ATACMS (186 miles).
BBC’s diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams wrote on Wednesday that “Ukraine has so far confined the use of Storm Shadow to the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops continue to hold ground.” He noted reports were still murky, and the target is not known “but Storm Shadow is powerful enough to penetrate bunkers, with extreme accuracy.”
Ukraine used US missiles to hit ammo depot
The attack comes a day after two US officials told CNN that Ukraine fired US-made ATACMS missiles for the first time across the border to hit a Russian weapons arsenal on Tuesday. The Biden administration on Sunday had given Kyiv the green light to use the longer-range American weapons against targets inside Russia.
Ukraine used eight US missiles to successfully hit an ammunition depot deep inside Russia, according to two US defense officials.
The facility struck is in Bryansk, north of the Kursk region, where Ukraine continues to hold Russian territory sezied in a counteroffensive.
According to an initial assessment of the strike, the Ukrainian attack damaged the ammo depot, the officials said. One official added that the US had seen indications of secondary explosions, a common result of striking facilities housing large quantities of ammunition and weapons.
Russia fired two interceptors at the incoming missiles and may have intercepted a pair of the ATACMS, the officials said, but the attack was still successful in hitting its target.
The US assessment contradicts the Russia’s claim that the Ukrainian attack did not cause any casualties or damage.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday that Ukraine had fired six ATACMS missiles at the facility in Bryansk, claiming five of the missiles were shot down and the sixth was damaged. The Ministry said fragments of the missiles fell on the territory of the military facility, causing a fire that was extinguished.
Ukraine has yet to confirm or deny the use of the longer-range US missiles. On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “Ukraine has long-range capabilities. Ukraine has long-range drones of its own production. We now have a long ‘Neptune’ (Ukrainian cruise missiles) and not just one. And now we have ATACMS. And we will use all of this.”","['Lauren Kent', 'Allegra Goodwin', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/europe/ukraine-us-embassys-closure-escalating-war-intl-latam/index.html,Analysis: US embassy’s temporary closure in Kyiv reflects a starkly escalating war in Ukraine,2024-11-20 20:26:01,"It is a very specific and high-profile warning, so you would expect the information behind it to have been quite precise.
The US Embassy in Kyiv has not closed since it relocated during the opening months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But on Wednesday, it announced a one-day closure, citing “specific information of a potential significant air attack.” Kyiv endures air attacks on an almost nightly basis – but the US step suggested a fear of being potentially targeted.
The Greek, Italian, and Spanish embassies followed suit, causing the Ukrainian foreign ministry to plead that its allies behave on the 1001st day of the war, as they had done on the previous thousand days, and not let their anxieties overcome them. Ukrainian defense officials even derided a fake warning circulated widely on Telegram claiming a massive Russian air attack, as being crude Russian-produced misinformation.
A senior advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, told CNN the apparent anxiety after years of war should be put down to Russia’s bid to use “elements of psychological influence.”
“[Moscow] have one instrument, which is to scare. This have always been a classic element of Russian politics. It’s blackmail and panic they want to create. I would like our partners to be more careful as to the information coming from Russia,” he said.
Residents in Kyiv struggled to reconcile the specific nature of the US warnings, with the quotidian daily threat they face. On Wednesday morning alone, there was a 45-minute air raid alert, and then another that lasted two and a half hours.
In the central Maidan Square, where a sea of flags are each marked with the name of a dead soldier, Anya planted one in memory of her father. She is used to air raids in her hometown of Krivyh Rih, but Wednesday felt different.
“I will be honest, we went down to the basement during every air raid siren today,” she said. “It was really scary indeed.”
Every flag in the square is a story of this war’s trauma and turmoil. Her father died in late October after five months in a coma from frontline injuries, she said. “I want peace very much, but want things to be as they used to be — without Russia. I just want all this to be over.”
Threats and talk of peace are deeply personal across Ukraine, yet the geopolitical risk is growing too. The US Embassy felt compelled to clarify its closure was not linked to the nuanced changes in Russia’s nuclear doctrine, loudly detailed by the Kremlin on Tuesday, insisting it stemmed from the fear of drone or missile attack.
Yet both statements showed how far this war is escalating: a US diplomatic mission saying it feared a direct Russian attack, then specifying at least this would not be nuclear.
It would be a grave and perhaps foolhardy move by the Kremlin to directly attack American government assets in Ukraine now. It would necessitate a severe American response that could trigger a wider war between NATO and Russia. Above all, it would likely tie the hands of US President-elect Donald Trump, who seems keen on stopping “the killing” and striking a deal with Russia. Putin would be wise to hold off a few months.
It is important to remember much of Russia’s domestic narrative insists Moscow is already in a wider war against the US and NATO. That is an inaccurate reflection of the proxy fight, in which NATO is arming Ukraine to wage in its own defense. But it is a story told by the Kremlin to Russians, intended to excuse their appalling performance over a thousand days, fighting a war that was only meant to last a few weeks.
While Russia is the aggressor, strategically it is difficult to see how Moscow can continue to endure the overt Western escalation against its territory without trying to assert some sort of deterrence again. They are slowly finding all the red lines the Kremlin head seems to lay down evaporate in the heat.
Kyiv will likely remain on edge. Moscow might inflict damage on a civilian target where Westerners are known to congregate — a major hotel, or district in the capital. Putin is unlikely to view his slow success on the frontline — and the looming change in the White House — as marking a moment where the tide is turning against him. Rather, he may see the next two months as a test of his patience and resolve, with clear rewards ahead.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/biden-administration-anti-personnel-mines-ukraine/index.html,Biden administration approves sending anti-personnel mines to Ukraine in another major policy shift,2024-11-20 04:02:25,"The Biden administration has approved sending anti-personnel mines to Ukraine for the first time in another major policy shift, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed on Wednesday.
The decision comes just days after the US gave Ukraine permission to fire long-range US missiles at targets in Russia, a shift that only occurred after months of lobbying from Kyiv.
The US intends for Kyiv to use the anti-personnel mines in the eastern part of the country, US officials said, where Russian troops have made slow and steady progress against Ukrainian defensive lines. The grinding battle has cost Moscow tremendously, with Ukraine claiming Russia suffered its highest number of casualties this week. But Russia’s unrelenting pressure, coupled with shortages in Ukrainian manpower and ammunition, has allowed the Russian military to gradually seize more territory.
Austin told reporters on Wednesday that the decision was motivated by Russia’s changing tactics on the frontlines.
“Because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting, they’ve kind of changed their tactics a bit,” Austin told reporters in Laos.
“They don’t lead with their mechanized forces anymore. They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces,” he explained.
Austin said Ukraine’s military needs “things that can help slow down that effort.”
The US expects Ukraine to use these anti-personnel mines to bolster defensive lines within sovereign Ukrainian territory, not as an offensive capability in Russia. The US has also sought assurances that Ukraine will try to limit the risk to civilians from the mines.
The administration’s decision was first reported by the Washington Post.
Since the early days of the war, the US has provided Ukraine with anti-tank mines to blunt Russia’s numerical superiority in armored vehicles. But until now, the Biden administration had not provided Ukraine with anti-personnel mines over concerns about the enduring danger they may pose. Human rights groups have long criticized the use of anti-personnel mines because they can kill indiscriminately and can remain armed for years after the conflict in which they were initially used has ended.
In June 2022 – four months after the start of the war in Ukraine – the Biden administration pledged to limit the use of anti-personnel mines. In announcing the decision, which was a reversal from the earlier Trump administration, the White House said there was a “need to curtail the use of (anti-personnel mines) worldwide.” The US said that it would no longer develop or export anti-personnel mines and would work to destroy all of its existing stockpiles. (The one exception to the policy was South Korea.)
The announcement of anti-personnel mines for Ukraine, especially with only weeks left in the Biden administration, is a sudden change on what had been a long-standing policy.
The type of mines the US provides to Ukraine will be “non-persistent,” according to the officials, meaning they have an internal mechanism to shorten the lifespan of the trigger. The mines are designed to become inert after a set period of time ranging from as little as four hours to two weeks, the officials said. The mines use an electrical fuse that requires a battery, and the mine becomes inert when the battery runs out.
Russia has deployed anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines since the earliest days of the war. As Russian forces advanced into Ukraine and established their own defensive lines, they established minefields to slow any Ukraine counterattack. Last summer, as Ukrainian forces mounted an ultimately unsuccessful counteroffensive, one Ukrainian official described the density of Russian mines as “insane.”

The attack comes just two days after the Biden administration gave Kyiv the green light to use the longer-range American weapons against targets inside Russia.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said Ukraine fired six ballistic missiles at a facility in Bryansk at 3:25 a.m. local time (7:25 p.m. ET) Tuesday and that ATACMS missiles had been used in the attack.
The attack marks the first time Ukraine has used the longer-range American weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, and shows that Kyiv has wasted little time in making use of its newly-granted powers.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declined to confirm or deny the attack during a Tuesday news conference but said: “Ukraine has long-range capabilities. Ukraine has long-range drones of its own production. We now have a long ‘Neptune’ (Ukrainian cruise missiles) and not just one. And now we have ATACMS. And we will use all of this.”
Russian air defenses said they shot down five of the missiles and another was damaged. Fragments from the damaged missile fell on the territory of a military facility, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no casualties or damage.
On the same day of the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine where Moscow will consider aggression from any non-nuclear state – but with the participation of a nuclear country – a joint attack on Russia.
In what appeared to be a fresh round of saber rattling, the Kremlin said Tuesday the revised military doctrine would, in theory, lower the bar to the use of nuclear weapons.
US President Joe Biden had authorized Ukraine to use longer-range American missiles inside Russia on Sunday, ending a months-long prohibition aiming to help Ukraine defend itself while not drastically escalating the conflict.
The decision came at a crucial moment in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is probing on the frontlines in Ukraine’s east while pummeling its cities with missile and drone strikes, aiming to disable Ukraine’s power grid and weaponize the freezing temperatures for a third consecutive winter.
Meanwhile, thousands of North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a daring counteroffensive in the summer.
In a press briefing Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the involvement of North Korean troops in the war was “a major escalation by Russia, bringing in an Asian military to a conflict inside Europe.”
The decision to allow the use of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, inside Russia had been under consideration for months, with American officials divided on the wisdom of allowing the new capability. Some had concerns about escalating the war, while others worried about dwindling stockpiles of the weapons.
Other Western allies remain more cautious. At the G20 summit in Brazil on Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated his stance of withholding Taurus missiles from Ukraine, adding that “supplying cruise missiles would be a mistake.”
Although Kyiv has repeatedly used Ukrainian-made drones to hit targets in Russia – deeper into the country than Bryansk – Moscow has long maintained that using far-reaching Western weapons would constitute a major escalation.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that Moscow will view launches of US-made longer-range missiles as a “new phase of war” by the West.
American officials said they were unsurprised by the news of Putin updating Russia’s nuclear doctrine. “Russia had been signaling its intent to update its doctrine for several weeks,” a US official told CNN.
Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said at a briefing that the US doesn’t have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine, adding, “It’s the same irresponsible rhetoric that we’ve seen before and that we’ve seen, frankly, for the past two years.”
In more than two-and-a-half years of war, Russia has often rattled the nuclear saber in response to perceived escalation by Ukraine and its allies.
After French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this year that he would not rule out sending European troops to Ukraine, Putin ordered a tactical nuclear weapons drill in response to what he called “threats” by the West.
For months, Ukraine’s President Zelensky had argued that “long-range capabilities for our army” is a key part of his “Victory Plan” for winning the war.
Responding on Sunday evening to reports of Biden’s green-light, Zelensky said: “Strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-missile-decision/index.html,Biden’s major missile reversal complicates potential western diplomatic thaw with Moscow,2024-11-19 18:08:06,"A major decision by the United States to allow Ukraine to fire long-range missiles deeper inside Russian territory has complicated a potential western diplomatic thaw with Russia as dozens of world leaders gather this week.
Sunday’s decision was viewed by many western leaders as a way to position Ukraine for success ahead of a change in American leadership, with the incoming president skeptical of continued US assistance.
But it also complicated the diplomatic dance leaders attending the G20 summit must partake in as they navigate the complex geopolitical dynamics of the bloc.
Russia “will perceive launches of long-range missiles guided by US military experts as a qualitatively new phase of war by the West,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a news conference at the summit, according to Russian state media TASS.
Lavrov attended the G20 in place of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who faced questions about whether he could be arrested for war crimes on international soil. Days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Brazilian authorities to arrest Putin, the Russian leader said he would skip the summit to avoid disrupting it.
Amid the change in strategy – which Biden had deliberated over for months – the president and his team steered clear of Lavrov on the ground in Rio.
When Biden missed a photo with other leaders on Monday, speculation abounded that he was trying to avoid being photographed with Lavrov. The White House denied that, citing a logistical snafu.
Still, neither Biden nor his delegation held talks with Lavrov or his team, US officials said. And Biden and Lavrov’s fluid schedules meant that they were not photographed together with other world leaders.
But some Western allies, sensing a sea change in the US approach to the conflict once Donald Trump takes office, appear to be weighing a shift in their own stance toward Moscow.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke to Putin by phone the week before the summit. In his remarks at the close of the summit, Lavrov also hailed the German government’s refusal to send Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine as a “responsible stance,” TASS reported.
And onsite in Rio, French President Emmanuel Macron could be seen shaking the hand of Lavrov, standing in the row behind him during a “family photo” of attendees.
In Rio, the pending Trump presidency shadowed nearly every discussion of the Ukraine conflict. Leaders here are acutely aware of Trump’s views toward the war, but are less certain of how that will manifest in policy once he takes office.
It’s not clear, for example, whether Trump would uphold Biden’s decision on allowing Ukraine the long-range capability, a step that NATO leaders had been encouraging for months. Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, questioned the decision in an interview Monday.
“It’s another step up the escalation ladder and nobody knows where this is going,” he said on Fox News, adding he hadn’t been given a heads up by the outgoing administration about the change in policy.
Officials in Rio declined to say whether Biden had raised the issue of the missiles with Trump during their two-hour meeting in the Oval Office last week.
“The two presidents discussed a wide range of issues. We’ve been pretty careful not to read that conversation out in any detail. Certainly, the conversation included all of the major issues of geopolitical significance, but I’m not going to get into the details of it,” deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said.
There had been hope among western officials of a strong statement denouncing Russia’s invasion at the conclusion of the summit. In particular, European diplomats made a late-stage push to strengthen the language following Russia’s massive drone and missile attack on Sunday, according to people familiar with the talks.
Ultimately, the effort was dropped when it appeared other countries were not on board. The language in the final leaders statement was watered down from previous years, including broad references to “human suffering” and “negative added impacts of the war” without explicit condemnation of Russia.
The Ukraine war generated only one paragraph in the final document, compared to several that were included in the final document produced by the G20 last year in New Delhi — which itself was watered down from the previous year.
As the summit was concluding, it was evident that tensions between the US and Russia were only ratcheting up. Russia announced as the second day of the summit was getting underway that it would update its nuclear doctrine to consider aggression from any non-nuclear state – but with the participation of a nuclear country – a joint attack on Moscow.
American officials were unsurprised to learn Moscow had updated its nuclear doctrine following Biden’s decision on long-range missiles.
“Russia had been signaling its intent to update its doctrine for several weeks,” a US official said in response to the doctrine update, adding that so far the US has not observed any updates to Russia’s nuclear posture — and thus see no reason to change the US stance.
“This is more of the same irresponsible rhetoric from Russia, which we have seen for the past two years,” the official said.
In his closing remarks, Lavrov sought to downplay the change in the fine print on its nuclear posture – shifting blame instead to the West.
“The update of the military doctrine does not add anything which would be different… from the American doctrine or documents on what to do with nuclear weapons,” according to Russian state media.","['Kayla Tausche', 'Kevin Liptak']",en

Under the updated doctrine, Moscow will consider aggression from any non-nuclear state – but with the participation of a nuclear country – a joint attack on Russia.
The change comes as Russia claims Ukraine fired the US-made ATACMS missiles into the Russian region of Bryansk. The attack, if confirmed, would mark the first such use by Ukraine since Biden gave the green light.
The Russian government had previously signaled that the US approval would be a dangerous escalation of the war in Ukraine, now 1,000 days old.
The Kremlin began this fresh round of nuclear saber-rattling Tuesday, saying the revised military doctrine would in theory lower the bar to first use of nuclear weapons.
In a phone call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noted the changes mean that “the Russian Federation reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of aggression using conventional weapons against it and/or the Republic of Belarus.”
Nuclear deterrence is a pillar of Russian military doctrine, but the revision appears to broaden the definition of what would be considered aggression against Russia.
“An important element of this document is that nuclear deterrence is aimed at ensuring that a potential adversary understands the inevitability of retaliation in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation or its allies,” Peskov said.
The revised doctrine is clearly meant to send a strong signal to Ukraine’s Western backers about the risks of escalation – and make policymakers and the public think twice about the possible consequences of providing more sophisticated and far-reaching weaponry to Ukraine.
But Russia has also escalated its own campaign against Ukraine in recent days, blanketing the country with drone and missile attacks that seem aimed in part at destroying civilian energy infrastructure as winter approaches.
Russia’s doctrinal change follows a consistent pattern of threatening rhetoric that has persisted since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
After French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this year that he would not rule out sending Western troops to Ukraine, Putin ordered a tactical nuclear weapons drill in response to what he called “threats” by the West.
Russia’s warnings around Western deliveries of military aid to Ukraine have become almost a matter of routine since the run-up to the full-scale invasion in February 2022.
The Kremlin has warned about “enormous risks” around the delivery of F-16 fighter jets, “serious consequences” for sending Patriot air-defense systems and has expressed fury over sending Western tanks to Ukraine.
But the revision of the nuclear doctrine appears designed to add a new level of credibility to Russian threats of escalation, particularly as a new administration prepares to take office in Washington.
Shifting red lines
Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, it has lowered the threshold under which it would consider using nuclear weapons.
In a 2020 update to the nuclear doctrine – before the war began – Putin said Moscow reserves the right to use nuclear weapons “when the very existence of the state is threatened.”
But changes outlined in September this year appeared to lower that threshold, saying Moscow could use nuclear weapons when facing “a critical threat to its sovereignty.”
Tuesday’s decree refines the circumstances in which Russia might resort to nuclear weapons. It essentially restates and makes official the terms set out in September’s proposed revision, which said Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. This updates the list of conventional weaponry whose launch might constitute a critical threat, and specifies an attack on Belarus would be viewed on an equal footing to Russia.
Russian officials responded furiously to reports that the Biden administration had lifted its years-long prohibition on Ukraine’s use of ATACMS – American weapons capable of striking targets deep in Russia.
Speaking Monday, Peskov said the move showed Biden wanted to “throw oil on the fire and escalate the conflict in Ukraine.”
However, the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump may complicate the Kremlin’s reaction to Biden’s decision to green-light Ukraine’s use of ATACM missiles.
Trump, who will take office in just over two months, has said he wants to bring the war in Ukraine to a swift end, but has not specified how he will do so.
Although Trump has not yet commented on Biden’s decision, his son, Donald Trump Jr., has criticized it.
“The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,” he said on social media.","['Anna Chernova', 'Nathan Hodge', 'Christian Edwards', 'Clare Sebastian']",en

Both nations joined the transatlantic alliance in the past two years, after Russia invaded its neighbor. Many European countries have since ramped up military spending to bolster long-term security in the region.
Booklets distributed to millions of households in the Nordic nations include instructions on how to prepare for the effects of military conflicts, communications outages and power cuts, as well as extreme weather events.
From stockpiling bottled water and sanitary products, to growing edible foodstuffs at home, government authorities offered tips on how residents could sustain themselves in the event of war. The brochures also include advice for parents and caregivers, instructing people to preserve diapers, medication and baby food.
The Swedish government will distribute “Om krisen eller kriget kommer (If crisis or war comes),” to all five million households over a two-week period from November 18, according to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), a governmental agency that compiled the pamphlet.
The fifth version of the Swedish brochure, which was first published in World War II, will place “greater emphasis on preparing for war,” a statement from the MSB said on Monday. The digital version of brochure, released in October, has been downloaded about 55,000 times, the agency added.
“The state of the world has worsened drastically in recent years. War is being waged in our vicinity. Extreme weather events are becoming increasingly common. Terror threats, cyberattacks, and disinformation campaigns are being used to undermine and influence us,” a statement on the MSB website said.
“To resist these threats, we must stand united and take responsibility for our country. If we are attacked, everyone must help defend Sweden’s independence and our democracy. We build resilience every day – together.”
New advice in the 2024 edition includes tips on evacuation, how to stop bleeding, dealing with anxiety, preparedness for pets, how to speak to children about crisis and war, and how to support especially vulnerable members of the population, added MSB.
Finland’s Ministry of the Interior also issued new crisis guidance on Monday, giving readers advice on how to prepare for long power cuts, water outages, telecommunications disruptions, extreme weather events, and military conflict.",['Sana Noor Haq'],en

Friday’s unilateral move by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to call Russian President Vladimir Putin ended nearly two years of major NATO leaders isolating the Kremlin head.
It was unmitigated bad news for Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a 72-hour period marked by the White House finally acceding to his request to be able to fire long-range American ATACMs weapons into Russia. Zelensky fumed that the call had opened “Pandora’s Box.” He said: “It is extremely impo rtant for (Putin) to weaken his isolation.”
Hours later, Zelensky seemed to acknowledge momentum toward talks, saying when US President-elect Donald Trump takes power “war will end sooner,” as this was the promise Trump had made to his voters.
Scholz said his call with Putin revealed the Russian leader’s hardline positions on Ukraine had not changed but added it was important for Europe to talk to Putin, if Trump was about to do the same.
The hour-long conversation marked the return of diplomacy to the decade-long conflict, even if their talk brought the familiar refrain it was not yet time to talk.
The call threw a wild card into a Western alliance experiencing wide-ranging anxiety over the outcome of the conflict in the light of Trump’s election, according to more than 10 interviews CNN carried out with current and former officials and diplomats over the past week.
One Western official said there was an “overall collective holding of breath” in Western capitals ahead of Trump’s inauguration.
“The Germans speaking to Putin – that will have gone down badly” among Ukraine’s allies, the official said. “Giving Putin that positive bounce will have irked the French and others.” French President Emmanuel Macron has been particularly vocal about continuing support for Ukraine.
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk posted on X that Sunday night’s substantial Russian missile assault on Ukraine showed that: “No-one will stop Putin with phone calls … telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine. The next weeks will be decisive, not only for the war itself, but also for our future.”
The Biden administration’s decision to permit ATACMs missiles to be fired at Russian territory is perhaps a reflection of the growing sense of escalation in the war, even as possible peace talks loom into view, as all sides seek to improve their position ahead of a Trump presidency.
Analysts said Scholz’s outreach was fueled by imminent German elections.
“Scholz is entering the election campaign as a ‘peacemaker’ to secure votes that might be otherwise drawn to the pro-Moscow bent of some German opposition,” said Alena Epifanova, a research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations.
Epifanova said the move might appeal to similar sympathies in Scholz’s own SPD party, but “otherwise it’s very unfortunate for Ukraine.”
A diplomat familiar with the mood inside NATO headquarters described uncertainty in the alliance as to where Trump would fall on continued support and peace negotiations, describing the next few months ahead as critical on the battlefield in Ukraine.
The uncertainty was echoed by a senior Ukrainian intelligence official, who told CNN: “It is very dangerous to make predictions now. We hope for the best!”
Most analysts speculate any deal would involve an approximate freezing of the front lines, with Moscow and Kyiv making or receiving security guarantees to prevent the conflict reigniting. Russia continues to make small yet consistent gains on the eastern front line, and would swallow about a fifth of Ukraine were the front lines negotiated into new permanent borders. Kremlin critics also warn of its history of using diplomacy as a pause or foil to pursuing its military goals.
A French defense official said: “Discussions surrounding the future of Ukraine have gone into overdrive” since Trump’s election, at the heart of which were security guarantees for Ukraine.
“What kind of concessions will Russia agree to?” the official asked. “Does Russia keep all the areas it has seized? And, if we freeze the status quo, will the war really be over? Can there be peace? Or will we see acts of sabotage and subversion?”
Pledges from the Biden administration and Europe have boosted assistance to Kyiv in the past weeks, aimed at indicating Kyiv’s support is assured for months to come.
A second Western official said a recent G7 agreement to loan $50 billion to Ukraine, based on the profits from frozen Russian assets, “means that essentially Ukraine is financially secure all 2025.”
The details of any Trump peace plan remain unclear, some analysts suggest, as the president-elect has yet to formulate a strategy, or decide on personnel who can. He famously said he could bring the war to an end in a day without saying how he would achieve that.
His incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has said almost nothing on policy since accepting the job, but wrote three days before the election in The Economist that fighting “‘as long as it takes’ in a war of attrition against a larger power is a recipe for failure.”
Allies have struggled to read limited signals from the incoming White House. A European diplomat said: “We take (Trump) at his word that he’ll move to a negotiated settlement,” adding the Trump camp had been guarded when discussing their policy, listening but revealing little, and “not saying ‘here’s the plan.’”
Trump supporters have, in part, sought to dispel the idea the president-elect would seek peace at any cost to Kyiv.
Kurt Volker, Trump’s Ukraine envoy in his first term from 2017 to 2019, said Trump’s opening move must be to “demonstrate strength” so Putin realizes it’s not worth continuing to fight, “then you can figure out the details from there. Trump has said many times: ‘peace through strength.’”
Volker said he thought Trump would issue loans rather than more aid to Ukraine.
“I am not convinced he’s going to cut (it) to zero. I believe it’s going to be a lend-lease program,” which Volker said would garner wide Republican support, referencing a World War Two era program under which US-made materiel was effectively loaned to Allies but not returned.
“It doesn’t cost the taxpayer … ‘Borrow as much money as you need, build up your military, be strong, but you should end the war.’”
Volker said he felt Trump would be influenced by the US “catastrophe” in Afghanistan under Biden.
Trump “wanted to get out of Afghanistan himself, but he never did because he was always told this is what would happen,” Volker said.
“He doesn’t want to have that kind of catastrophe on his watch. He’s going to try to find a way to end the war, but Ukraine survives.”
The appointment of Waltz as national security adviser and nomination of Sen. Marco Rubio to secretary of state – both China hawks – may increase focus on the introduction of North Korean troops and weaponry by Moscow to the front line, Western officials suggested.
The move may backfire for Putin, they said, turning the Ukrainian front line into a more global arena, where the United States must now face down Indo-Pacific foes like Kim Jong Un, and his occasional sponsor Beijing.
A former US diplomat familiar with Trump’s approach explained the president-elect’s controversially friendly attitude toward the Kremlin head stemmed from Trump not wanting to “demonize adversaries or people he has to cut deals with.”
They added: “He’ll take policy decisions that are tough, or allow others to do that,” but wants to “have a relationship.”
The former diplomat said Moscow’s deceptive history in negotiations was why Kyiv must be properly armed as part of any settlement. “Putin won’t be sincere – let’s be clear,” the diplomat said.
“He’s going to ask for things that are unreasonable. And then even if he agrees to a ceasefire, he’s going to still then plan on attacking again later.”","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Alex Marquardt', 'Saskya Vandoorne']",en

The situation has reached a fever pitch as US officials are concerned about the structural integrity of the leaking module and the “possibility of a catastrophic failure” for the aging space laboratory.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Ukraine
President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use powerful long-range US weapons deep inside Russia. The decision had been under consideration for months and comes as Moscow has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to Kursk, the southern Russian region where Kyiv launched its surprise counteroffensive in the summer. Thousands of North Korean troops were also recently sent to Kursk to boost the size of Russia’s army, the US State Department said, sparking concern from Biden and his advisers that their entry could lead to a dangerous new phase in the war. The US had refused to send the long-range weapons to Ukraine for the first two years of the conflict, in part because of readiness concerns and fearing the move would be escalatory.
2. Trump transition
President-elect Donald Trump is refusing to back down over his controversial Cabinet picks despite unease on Capitol Hill following fresh revelations and allegations about their pasts. Two of Trump’s selections are facing particular scrutiny: The House Ethics Committee is under pressure to release its report on sexual misconduct allegations against attorney general pick Matt Gaetz, and sources say Trump’s team was caught off guard by a 2017 sexual assault allegation against Trump’s choice for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. Many of Trump’s picks must now be confirmed in the Senate, although the president-elect has pushed to bypass the typical confirmation process.
3. Climate
President Joe Biden has become the first sitting president to visit the Amazon rainforest. In prepared remarks over the weekend, Biden described the fight against climate change as a “defining” part of his presidency, warning future administrations that undoing it would risk depriving the world of its benefits. “I will leave my successor and my country a strong foundation to build on if they choose to do so,” Biden said without naming President-elect Donald Trump. As Trump is likely to roll back on the US’ role as a global climate leader, experts say China will have to lead the charge. A CNN analysis shows China has more power than any other nation to put a dent in global emissions as it is the world’s biggest polluter of planet-heating carbon.
4. Carrot recall
The CDC is investigating an E. coli outbreak in at least 18 states linked to some organic carrots, which has led to at least one death. The bagged carrots were sold under multiple brand names, including Grimmway Farms, Sprouts, Trader Joe’s, Wegmans, Good & Gather and more, according to the recall notice. At least 39 cases of E. coli have been linked to the carrots since early September, leading to 15 hospitalizations and one death, according to the CDC. People who have recalled carrots should throw them out or return them to the store and clean surfaces they have touched, health officials said.
5. Spirit Airlines
Spirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy today as mounting losses, unaffordable debt, increased competition for bargain-seeking airline passengers and the inability to merge with other airlines left it little choice. The airline said it will continue to operate as it restructures its debt and expects to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange “in the near term.” Recent SEC filings disclosed Spirit had around $3 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet. However, airlines and other companies in the US frequently file for bankruptcy and emerge stronger on the other side of the process. Most major US airlines, including the three largest — American Airlines, United and Delta — have filed for bankruptcy at some point in the past 25 years.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/europe/germany-scholz-russia-putin-call-ukraine-intl-latam/index.html,"Germany’s Scholz calls Putin, ending Western isolation over Ukraine",2024-11-15 00:00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized a call between Germany’s chancellor and Russian President Vladimir Putin as opening a “Pandora’s box” that only works to undermine efforts to isolate Russia’s leader.
“This is exactly what Putin has been wanting for a long time: it is extremely important for him to weaken his isolation, Russia’s isolation, and to have normal negotiations that will not end in anything,” Zelensky said about Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s call.
The conversation on Friday was the first time Scholz had spoken with Putin in two years. It comes as the German leader gears up for a snap election and Europe waits to hear US President-elect Donald Trump’s plan for ending the war in Ukraine.
On the call, Scholz urged Putin to pull his forces out of Ukraine and begin talks with Kyiv that would open the way for a “just and lasting peace,” the German government said, Reuters reported.
The Kremlin said the conversation had come at Berlin’s request, and that Putin had told Scholz any agreement to end the war in Ukraine must take Russian security interests into account and reflect “new territorial realities.”
Zelensky and other European officials had cautioned Scholz against the move, according to sources familiar with the matter, who believed it was more for domestic consumption, Reuters reported.
Facing a snap election on Feb. 23, Scholz’s Social Democrats are coming under pressure from Russia-friendly populist parties on both sides of the political spectrum that argue the government has not deployed enough diplomacy to end the war, according to Reuters.
“The chancellor urged Russia to show willingness to enter talks with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace,” a German government spokesperson said in a statement, Reuters added.
“He stressed Germany’s unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,” the spokesperson added, said Reuters.
Ukraine said however that phone conversations with Putin brought no added value on the path to achieving a “just peace” in Ukraine. “This [the call] made it possible for Russia to change nothing in its policy, to do nothing in essence, and this is exactly what led to this war,” Zelensky said in his evening address.
The call comes in the week after Trump was elected as the next US president. He has suggested he could put a swift end to the war, without explaining how, and repeatedly criticized the scale of Western financial and military aid for Kyiv.
“It sends a bad signal especially after Trump’s election,” said one Western diplomat to Reuters, noting their country had told Berlin it was not a good idea. “My hope is that Scholz can now say to his electorate ‘look, I have done it, and it’s a waste of time as Putin isn’t open to anything’. But of course, (it is a) question about how Russia spins it.”
Scholz to brief allies
The Kremlin said Putin had told Scholz Russia was willing to look at energy deals if Germany was interested. Germany was heavily reliant on Russian gas before the war but direct shipments ceased when pipelines under the Baltic Sea were blown up in 2022.
Scholz plans to brief Zelensky, Germany’s allies, partners and the heads of the European Union and NATO on the outcome of Friday’s call, German officials said, according to Reuters. Putin and Scholz agreed to stay in contact, they added.
Ukraine is facing increasingly difficult conditions on the frontlines in its east amid shortages of arms and personnel, while Russian forces make steady advances.
A separate German government official told Reuters that Scholz had told Putin the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia for combat missions against Ukraine was seen as a serious escalation and expansion of the conflict.
Zelensky says North Korea has 11,000 troops in Russia and that some have suffered casualties in combat with Ukrainian forces which are currently occupying territory in Russia’s southern Kursk region.
Germany has given Ukraine a total of 15 billion euros in financial, humanitarian and military support since the start of the full-scale war, making it Kyiv’s second-largest backer after the United States, according to Reuters.
The future of US aid to Ukraine is unclear following Trump’s election victory.

Russian state TV has spent the last few days using their slickly produced talk shows to tell the Russian people what they should make of the incoming administration – in particular what it might mean for Russians and the war in Ukraine.
Evgeny Popov, a well-known face on Russian state TV and Duma representative used his show, co-hosted with his wife, to tear into Mike Waltz, Donald Trump’s pick for his national security adviser.
Waltz has previously expressed reservations about continued congressional support for Ukraine, and is a proponent of a peace plan for Ukraine – but has not ruled out applying pressure on Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin to force him to the table. Waltz also described Russia as “a gas station with nukes” in an interview with NPR on November 4.
Popov was quick to point out the potential threat to Moscow, “(Waltz) at the Republican convention proposed deploying more American drones in the Black Sea and bragged about how Trump threatened to bomb, as he put it, ‘Putin’s Kremlin.’ That is what’s called the Russophobic Dream Team or the American dream team.”
But across the studio floor, Olga Skabeeva, Popov’s wife, was a little more welcoming of the pick of former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. Gabbard had been “clear on the reason for Russia’s special operation in Ukraine,” Skabeeva said, praising Gabbard’s criticism of US support for Kyiv.
Meanwhile on the streets in Moscow, people interviewed by CNN were largely not well versed with the incoming administration – except for when it came to Elon Musk, who has been named as the future leader of a new Department of Government Efficiency along with Vivek Ramaswamy.
Tatiyana, wrapped in her matching pink hat and scarf, told CNN that Elon Musk “is an example of the future of the planet. He does a lot to improve our planet, and this is the right development. Therefore, we wish him only prosperity and all the best.”
Elena, who was walking with her daughter, said of Musk: “Everything he’s done is very interesting, and the fact that he has such ideas is also, in principle, good for development in general.”
The tech tycoon’s status as a super-rich maverick who purchased X, formerly Twitter, and who wants to put civilians into space, means he’s more familiar to Russians than nominees for other prominent posts.
Asked about how they viewed the incoming administration and future relations between old adversaries, people were a little more divided.
“Trump said that ‘I will do everything for America’, but he did not say a word about Russia,” Sergey told CNN.
Vladimir Kostyukevich, however, said that Trump makes a good impression as a politician, citing his age and apparent energy – a barb perhaps at outgoing President Joe Biden.
On the thorny issue of Ukraine, invaded at Putin’s orders in February 2022, however, those who spoke to CNN expressed a desire for the war to come to an end, but many were not clear how Trump might be able to do it.
Elena said, “I don’t know how Donald Trump can resolve this. But I would really like this to be resolved as soon as possible and resolved in the most peaceful way possible, through negotiations, and not through the actions that are happening now.”
Tatiyana meanwhile hoped for peace and spoke warmly of Ukraine, a reminder of the bonds that tie the two nations together.
“It’s a good question. Ukraine is our brotherly nation. It has always been so. And despite the fact that relations are so complicated now, we still love Ukraine as before, they are our brothers, our relatives,” she said.
And Kostyukevich hoped for even more. “I don’t know if Trump will stick to his line. But I hope, that there will be a good agreement between Russia and Ukraine. And in general, to stop all this madness that’s happening in the world, well, in Israel, Palestine and Ukraine-Russia,” he said.",['Sebastian Shukla'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/europe/ukrainian-mother-killed-russian-strike-zelensky-hometown-intl/index.html,Ukrainian mother and three children killed in a Russian strike on Zelensky’s hometown,2024-11-14 16:33:59,"It took more than a day for rescuers to find Ulyana Kulyk’s tiny body in the rubble.
She was just two months old when a Russian missile hit her home in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Monday morning. Her father was the sole survivor.
Ukrainian officials said it was one of several strikes targeting southern and central cities that morning and the latest in a string of nearly weekly strikes against residential buildings in Kryvyi Rih, many of them deadly.
The city lies some 70 kilometers (40 miles) from the southern Ukrainian front line.
The UN children’s agency UNICEF said that tragic stories like the one of Ulyana and her family “have become the norm in Ukraine as attacks on populated areas continue.”
“In the first 12 days of November, intense and sustained attacks have killed at least four children and injured more than twenty,” the organization said.
Photographs and videos from the scene give a glimpse of the incredible force with which the ballistic missile struck their apartment block. The five-story building looks as if it was sliced in half, with a huge chunk of it missing in the middle.
Ulyana’s mother Olena, 32, and brothers Kyrylo, 10, and Demyd, 2, were all killed. Her father Maksym likely only survived because he was in the kitchen cooking the family breakfast when the building was struck, according to local media.
“I don’t want to live. And today I was supposed to be here with you, the fifth,” Maksym Kulyk said at his children’s and wife’s joint funeral on Thursday.
The funeral was a heart-wrenching affair. Four coffins of the same design and varying sizes, showered with flowers and toys, as dozens of family and friends, including many children, came to say goodbye to the family.
As Kulyk spoke, addressing each of his children and his wife, another air raid siren sounded in the city – as if those attending the funeral needed a reminder that the conflict was still raging.
Olena was an employee of Steel Service, a subsidiary of global giant ArcelorMittal, and was on maternity leave at the time of the attack.
“My soul, my blood, my heart, my support and strength, my rear. I love you so much. I will always love you,” Kulyk said about her.
Kyrylo, the oldest of the three children, was described by his father as his “best friend” and by staff at his school as “a bright light for everyone who knew him.”
“He was only 10 years old, but his short life was full of joy, dreams and boundless love. His smile, carefree laugh and inexhaustible energy brought joy not only to his family, but also to his friends, classmates, teachers and everyone around him,” the 103rd School in Kryvyi Rih said in a statement on Facebook. It said the fourth grader loved reading books, exploring the world and playing football.
“Demyd. I bathed you, slept with you, fed you, went for walks with you. You always said ‘daddy’,” Kulyk said, adding that he was looking forward to Ulyana becoming a “daddy’s girl.”
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s ombudsman, pointed out that all of the children had been born since the conflict with Russia started in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
“A two-month-old girl and boys aged two and 10. These children were born during the war. The 10-year-old boy was born when Russia started its armed aggression against Ukraine. The two-year-old was born when Russia launched a full-scale invasion. The girl was born only recently,” he said in a statement.
The local authorities in Kryvyi Rih declared Wednesday an official day of mourning.
The city has seen a number of ballistic missile strikes in recent weeks. Two, each killing two people and injuring more than a dozen, struck Kryvyi Rih within one week earlier this month. In September, at least 10 people, including a 12-year-old child, were killed in three separate missile strikes.
900 bombs in one week
The frequent waves of aerial attacks come as Ukraine struggles to repel Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Russia appears to be preparing for a counteroffensive in its southern Kursk region, deploying tens of thousands troops into the area, according to Ukrainian and US officials.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that in just one week, Russia dropped more than 900 bombs and launched some 30 missiles and nearly 500 drones across Ukraine. He said that most of the strikes were directed against civilian objects and critical infrastructure.
Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska are from Kryvyi Rih, a city that lies some 70 kilometers (40 miles) from the southern Ukrainian front line.
When the news of the three children killed in the city emerged on Tuesday, Zelenska paid tribute to the victims and made yet another emotional plea to Ukraine’s allies.
“Our only dream is that such a tragedy will never happen again. But the murders cannot be stopped by words. I want everyone who can help us stop the enemy and the grief (the enemy) brings to Ukraine to hear me. Please don’t look for reasons to postpone your help until later. Children must live,” she said in a post on her Telegram channel.
Ukraine marked 1,000 days since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 on Tuesday, with many inside the country and elsewhere worried about the impact of former President Donald Trump’s second term in office on the conflict. Trump has previously said he would end the conflict “in 24 hours,” without revealing any details as to how.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en

Elise Stefanik, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, is now refusing to stand by her previous push for Ukraine’s NATO membership — a stance she once framed as critical to regional stability.
Her office also declined to say whether she still believes Russia committed genocide in Ukraine, as she said in 2022.
In 2022, Stefanik urged NATO to admit the nation, especially as Russia’s invasion escalated. At the time, she argued for extensive military aid support, highlighting the Trump administration’s previous providing of Javelin missiles.
“I’ve seen how important Ukraine is for the region,” she said. “They need to be admitted into NATO and we need to do everything we can by providing them munitions and javelins, and remember, the javelins were supplied under the Trump administration.”
Her comments at the time reflected the strong pro-Ukraine stance that aligned with broad bipartisan support for Kyiv in the early days of the conflict.
Now, when asked if she still supports NATO membership for Ukraine, Stefanik’s spokesperson declined to specifically address her current position. Instead, her office signaled that she is aligning with Trump’s approach.
“Chairwoman Stefanik fully supports President Trump’s peace through strength policy agenda and will follow his lead as Commander in Chief on best practices to end the war in Ukraine,” her communications director, Ali Black, told CNN.
Stefanik’s non-answer on Ukraine’s possible NATO membership comes as public opinion on providing aid has shifted away from the early US support for Ukraine, with Trump and other Republicans voicing increasing skepticism about the role of American military and financial aid in the prolonged conflict that has gone on for more than two and a half years.
Stefanik’s actions in the House also have shifted with public opinion. She initially championed pro-Ukraine legislation and supported numerous sanctions against Russia along with multiple rounds of military aid for Ukraine. But in April, she voted against a $60 billion Ukraine aid package, citing concerns over the spending and saying it was better to prioritize the crisis at the southern border.
That stands at contrast with comments she made in April 2022, when she touted that she was among nearly 400 members of the US House of Representatives sanctioned by Russia, calling it a “badge of honor.” She described Russia’s actions as “genocide” against the Ukrainian people and labeled Russian President Vladimir Putin a “thug” and “war criminal.”
Her office declined to comment further when asked if she stood by her past comments that Russia was committing genocide in Ukraine.",['Andrew Kaczynski'],en

The cry was the defiant response of Ukrainian defenders to a Russian warship calling for surrender in the early days of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The General Court of the European Union said the phrase “quickly became a symbol of Ukraine’s fight against Russian aggression,” and was widely used in a political context to promote support for Ukraine, a press release from the Court of Justice of the European Union outlined.
The bold words were the last known radio communication from Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island, a rocky island in the Black Sea. They soon became a widely memed symbol of Ukrainian resistance.
The phrase was repeated on everything from T-shirts to postage stamps and road signs.
The State Border Guard of Ukraine had intended to use the trademark to sell a wide range of goods, as well as for publishing, education, entertainment, and sports services.
The court judged that the trademark would fail to fulfill its essential function; consumers would perceive a political message, rather than the “indication of a commercial origin,” the press release said.",['Caitlin Danaher'],en

Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who apparently was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv’s troops and had blamed Moscow for the war.
A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor.
Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her.
Her defense argued the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial.
In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was “painful” to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down.
“A doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child’s psyche. Only a monster is capable of this – and of the words that I allegedly said to them,” Mediazona quoted her as saying.
Buyanova’s case drew national attention, with more than 6,500 people signing an online petition demanding her freedom and supporters regularly attending court hearings. As the judge read out the verdict, they shouted, “Disgrace!” before bailiffs escorted everyone from the courtroom.
Her lawyer, Oscar Cherdzhyev, told reporters afterward that the verdict was “unexpectedly harsh” and “monstrously cruel.”
“We didn’t expect this,” he said.
“Spreading false information” about the army has been a criminal offense since March 2022, when Russia adopted a series of laws prohibiting any public expression about the invasion that deviated from the official narrative. Authorities started actively using them against critics and protesters.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-intl/index.html,"Ukraine is fighting 50,000 troops in Russia’s Kursk region, Zelensky says",2024-11-07 00:00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that Russia has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to Kursk, the southern Russian region where Kyiv launched its surprise counteroffensive in the summer.
Ukrainian troops “continue to hold back” the “nearly 50,000-strong enemy group” in Kursk, Zelensky said in a post on Telegram after receiving a briefing from General Oleksandr Syrskyi, the Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces.
Russian forces launched offensives into Kursk in several waves on Monday, a spokesperson for one of Ukraine’s mechanized brigades said Tuesday, though none of them were successful.
“They stormed with a battalion-sized force,” Anastasiia Blyshchyk said, adding that Ukrainian forces destroyed Russian vehicles and equipment, and that “the Russian invaders were eliminated.” It was “a black day for the Russian occupiers,” she said.
Kyiv launched its incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August, taking by surprise not just Moscow, but also its allies. It said at the time that the operation was necessary, because Russia had been planning to launch a new attack on Ukraine from the region. It said it was aiming to create a “buffer zone” to prevent future cross-border attacks.
The Kursk offensive, the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II, caught Moscow completely unprepared.
Ukrainian troops advanced quickly, deep into Russia’s territory and have since maintained control over hundreds of square miles of Russia’s territory. And while Russia has reclaimed some settlements, the line of control has barely changed over the past months.
A US official told CNN on Sunday that Russia has amassed a large force of tens of thousands — including recently arrived North Korean troops — to carry out an assault on the Ukrainian positions in Kursk. The official said the offensive was expected in the coming days.
The Kremlin has not commented on the presence of North Korean troops on its territory. At a meeting of the UN Security Council last week, Russia refused to answer questions from the US about its deployment of North Korean troops.
At the same time though, Russian state media TASS reported Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law ratifying a mutual defense treaty with North Korea, while North Korean media reported Monday that Kim Jong Un had also signed the treaty into law.
The pact is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. It also consolidates the Kim regime’s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council.
Russia and North Korea have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries with 1.2 million soldiers, but most of its troops lack combat experience.
Zelensky said last week that 11,000 North Korean soldiers were now in the region.
Separately, a Ukrainian commander told CNN Sunday that North Korean troops were taking part in direct combat operations in Kursk, as well as defensive operations in the neighboring Belgorod region of Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.
North Korean troops deployed to Russia’s Kursk region have fought Kyiv’s forces on the battlefield, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday, adding that the clashes resulted in fatalities.
Kyiv braces for second Trump presidency
Ukraine is once again finding itself in a difficult position. Russia has been launching near daily waves of long-range drone strikes on its cities while also struggling to hold back Russian advances at multiple locations along the more than 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) frontline.
Over the weekend, Russia and Ukraine exchanged record numbers of drone strikes, with Moscow launching a total of 145 drones on Saturday night.
Ukraine meanwhile fired an unprecedented number of drones towards Russia’s capital overnight on Saturday into Sunday.
At the same time, Kyiv is trying to gauge the impact of Donald Trump’s victory in the US election last week. Trump has previously said he could end the conflict in 24 hours and in September he declared: “I think it’s in the US’ best interest to get this war finished and just get it done.”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en

Every other night, many of its 4.5 million residents have been woken by sirens and rushed to some form of shelter or hidden in their bathrooms.
In the first week of November alone, sirens blared for 43 hours.
The onslaught is just one indicator of Russia’s ability to prosecute its assault at full throttle, even as Ukraine faces deep uncertainty about future support from the US and Europe.
The cities of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa have also suffered frequent drone and missile strikes in recent weeks in what appears to be a renewed Russian effort to break the resolve of Ukrainian civilians.
On Saturday night, Ukrainian air defenses detected a record 145 incoming Shahed drones.
The spike in attacks on cities comes as Russian forces continue to make incremental gains in Donetsk, while Ukrainian units suffer from manpower shortages and are increasingly stretched along the vast front line.
‘Constant anxiety’
Residents of Kyiv have told CNN of long and frightening nights of sirens and strikes, with debris falling on apartment blocks, businesses and homes.
Viktoria Kovalchuk said that after debris from a drone fell close to her home last week her 6-year-old son Teo was “very scared and grabbed onto me.”
Kovalchuk said Teo was in a state of constant anxiety. “For the past two months, when the shelling has become more frequent, we have been hiding in the bathroom or going down to the shelter in the basement,” Kovalchuk said.
“I don’t remember when we had a proper night’s sleep.”
Businesses are also suffering. A man who gave his name as Maksym told CNN debris pierced the roof of his restaurant last week, causing some $10,000 in damage.
“We will restore everything on our own and continue to work as we have been doing,” he insisted.
Alarms alone are hugely disruptive to the city’s life. Bridges close, public transport is halted, and the two parts of the capital either side of the Dnipro river are effectively cut off.
Konstantin Usov, Deputy Mayor of Kyiv, told CNN that during attacks, “the city freezes … This alone leads to enormous delays in the functioning of the city’s economy.”
Many children don’t come to school during alerts, Usov said.
Many air defense batteries are run by volunteers from all walks of life – among them one of the judges on Ukraine’s Supreme Court, Yuriy Chumak.
Chumak told CNN that territorial defense units included members of parliament, an opera singer and a TV presenter.
“We have been doing this for over two years,” he said, but the intensity of drone attacks had peaked over the past two to three months.
Their equipment is low-tech – machine-guns on the roofs of eight high-rise buildings. “Drones were flying low, (so) it was realistic and cheap to shoot them down with a machine gun.”
“At night, we are on duty continuously. There are attacks every day now,” Chumak added.
The drone attacks seem calculated to instil fear rather than cause mass casualties, but several people have been killed in recent weeks. Among them was 15-year-old Mariya Troyanivska, described by her Kyiv school as an inspiration “who loved life and gave joy to everyone around her.”
The relentless attacks do appear to be eroding morale. The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology regularly asks people whether Ukraine should continue fighting for as long as it takes. The number saying yes has fallen from 73% in February to 63% last month.
‘Difficult’ front lines
That perception is likely fed by news from the front, where Russian assaults continue to erode Ukrainian defenses, especially close to the key hub of Pokrovsk in Donetsk.
The commander in chief of the military, Oleksander Syrskyi, said Saturday that, “the situation remains difficult and tends to escalate. The enemy, taking advantage of its numerical superiority, continues to conduct offensive actions and focuses its main efforts on the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions.”
After a two-week trip to Ukraine last month, analyst Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting said the key problem is to integrate newly mobilized troops.
Muzyka posted on X that the Ukrainian incursion into the Russian region of Kursk “has stretched the already small Ukrainian forces even further.”
The Ukrainians are using a variety of battlefield drones to inflict losses on the Russians. Syrskyi said more than 52,000 enemy targets were destroyed or damaged by drones in October alone.
But drones cannot compensate for a shortage of infantry, Muzyka reflected. Despite a law passed earlier this year to improve mobilization, “the presence of newly mobilized units/soldiers is practically imperceptible.”
“We have a situation in which the Ukrainians not only cannot keep up with replacing losses, but also lose soldiers at an increasingly rapid pace due to falling morale,” Muzyka said on X.
Russian forces have become more adept at exploiting weaker points on the front line, enabling them to eat away at Ukrainian defenses within 6 miles (10 km) of Pokrovsk.
On many other parts of the 600-mile frontline, the Ukrainians are also on the defensive, with some analysts expecting another Russian push in the south. The only gains for the Ukrainians this year have been inside Russia, where they launched a surprise incursion in the Kursk region in August.
The negative outlook has darkened the mood among Ukraine’s allies, who talk much less about Kyiv prevailing on the battlefield – and much more about it holding enough ground to force the Kremlin to negotiate.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin implied as much. “No single capability will turn the tide. No one system will end Putin’s assault. What matters is the combined effects of Ukraine’s military capabilities — and staying focused on what works.”
Rym Montaz of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, assesses that there is a “growing, quiet consensus that negotiations, which will entail accepting at least a temporary loss of sovereignty over territories, are the only way to end this war.”
“Kyiv is at one of its weakest points since February 2022, and the prospect of selling such a negotiation is a political minefield” for Zelensky, Montaz says.
Victory, defined by the Ukrainian government as ousting Russian troops from all its territory, is widely seen as unattainable.
In a new essay in Foreign Affairs, Richard Haass says that “Washington must grapple with the grim reality of the war and come to terms with a more plausible outcome.”
“There is no game-changing weapon or lifted restriction that would allow Ukraine to simultaneously defend what it already controls and liberate what it does not,” Haas writes.
Ukrainian officials are putting a brave face on a gloomy outlook.
Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Saturday: “I am convinced that we are all united by the goal of achieving a just peace for Ukraine and stopping Russian aggression … We are talking about a just peace, not appeasement.”
The path to any negotiation is – to put it mildly – unclear. The Kremlin says its goals in Ukraine are unchanged: the annexation of four eastern and southern Ukrainian regions. Russian forces already occupy almost all of Luhansk and substantial parts of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – altogether some 20% of Ukraine.
“If Ukraine wants to persuade Russia to join peace talks, it must first stabilize the front and rebuild its forces enough to be able to conduct offensives,” says Muzyka.
Talk of how to end the conflict will now go into overdrive with Donald Trump’s election triumph. Trump has previously said he could end the war in 24 hours and in September he declared: “I think it’s in the US’ best interest to get this war finished and just get it done.”
One option favored by his vice president-elect, JD Vance, is to freeze the conflict on its current lines with a heavily fortified demilitarized zone to deter future Russian aggression. Along a poorly defined front line hundreds of miles long, that would be a daunting and perhaps impossible task.
It would reward the Kremlin with control of territories already seized. Moscow would also demand guarantees of Ukraine’s neutrality or at least the indefinite suspension of its drive to join NATO.
Even if on the backfoot, this would be impossible for President Volodymyr Zelensky to swallow without guarantees of Ukraine’s future security. And after the sacrifices of the past 1,000 days, it would also be unpalatable to many Ukrainians.
Chumak, the Supreme Court judge, insisted to CNN: “Our mood is patriotic, it hasn’t changed, we are ready to go all the way.”
But the destination may be changing.","['Tim Lister', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Victoria Butenko']",en

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers are in the region, where Ukraine’s three-month military incursion into Russian territory has stalled.
The New York Times reported Sunday that some 50,000 Russia and North Korean troops are set to take part in the assault.
CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian government for comment.
A Ukrainian commander told CNN Sunday that North Korean troops were taking part in direct combat operations in Kursk, as well as defensive operations in the neighboring Belgorod region of Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.
“Mostly, the tasks are defined as the second echelon of defense. In the Kursk region, these are direct combat operations,” he said, adding that among the personnel were specialist artillerymen and snipers.
“These groups will be directly involved in combat operations in the short term on the territory of Ukraine. They are highly likely to emerge in the occupied territories of Ukraine as well,” the commander said.
He said the North Korean troops were a “significant resource” for Russia’s war on Ukraine, as even those being deployed defensively would free up Russian troops for assault operations elsewhere and would themselves eventually be used in direct combat.
“In military terms, they amount to three full-blooded brigades. Imagine that now the enemy withdraws 10,000 soldiers from the second line of defense, puts soldiers from North Korea there, and sends these three brigades to one of the (places where) active hostilities are underway. Are three full-blooded brigades a significant resource? Yes, it is a significant resource,” Fedorenko said.
Reports that North Korea was sending troops to Russia began appearing last month, though both countries dismissed the allegations at the time. Russia and North Korea, both pariahs in the West, have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries with 1.2 million soldiers, but most of its troops lack combat experience.
Ukraine invaded the Kursk region over the summer, shocking Russia, in the first invasion of the country since World War II.
But Ukraine’s incursion hasn’t stopped Russia’s steady advancement in the eastern part of Ukraine, where its army chief has warned his forces are facing “one of the most powerful Russian offensives” since the start of the war.
Moscow is also unleashing near-constant waves of long-range drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and firing decoy drones without warheads to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses, according to a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air force.
The Ukrainian president said from Budapest on Thursday that world leaders are not listening hard enough to his pleas to allow Kyiv to use long-range weapons as it faces a “new wave of escalation” involving “the army of another state in the war against Ukraine.”
All of this comes amid questions about Ukraine’s future with US President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in January. Trump has promised to end the war in “24 hours.”
Throughout his election campaign, Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, cast doubts on continued US commitment to Kyiv. They made comments suggesting the US could pressure Ukraine into an uneasy truce with Russia, causing Kyiv and its NATO allies to brace for the possibility of a dramatic reduction in US support two and a half years after Moscow invaded.
On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first public comments on the US election, saying he is ready for dialogue with the Republican president-elect and noting that Trump’s comments on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine “deserve attention at the very least.”
Trump and Zelensky spoke the day after the election, when the Ukrainian president called to congratulate the president-elect for what a source briefed on the call described as a positive conversation. Trump put the call on speaker, and tech billionaire Elon Musk joined the conversation. The call was roughly seven minutes long, and no policy was discussed, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration on Friday lifted a de facto ban on American military contractors deploying to Ukraine to help the country’s military maintain and repair US-provided weapons systems, an official with direct knowledge of the plan told CNN.

Ukraine meanwhile fired an unprecedented number of drones towards Russia’s capital overnight on Saturday into Sunday.
“Last night, Russia launched a record 145 Shaheds and other strike drones against Ukraine,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday.
Shahed drones are cheap, one-way attack drones. They are “fire and forget,” meaning a flight path is programmed, the UAV is launched, and it then independently flies towards the target area.
Zelensky added that during the week, Russia has used more than 800 guided aerial bombs, around 600 strike drones, and nearly 20 missiles of various types.
The Ukrainian Air Force Command said in a statement that Russia “attacked Ukraine with a record number of UAVs” on Saturday night. As of 9.30 a.m. local time Sunday morning, 62 of the drones had been shot down by Ukrainian defenses, according to the Air Force command.
It added, “67 enemy drones were lost locator-wise in different regions of Ukraine, and another 10 Russian UAVs left Ukrainian airspace in the direction of Moldova, Belarus and Russia.”
Ukraine meanwhile launched its largest attack on Moscow since the start of the war overnight, disrupting flights at two airports in the Russian capital.
A total of 34 drones were launched in the direction of Moscow, the Russian Ministry of Defense said. Russia’s air defenses shot down all of the drones over the Moscow region between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Sunday morning, according to the Russian MOD.
The UAVs were shot down over the Moscow regions of Ramenskoye, Kolomna and Domodedovo, Andrey Vorobyov, governor of Moscow region, said.
Shrapnel from the falling drones caused two houses in Ramenskoye to catch fire. A woman, 52, was injured by the shrapnel and taken to hospital with “burns to her face, neck and hands,” Vorobyov said, adding that the woman is in intensive care.
Sunday’s attack forced the “temporary restrictions” of flights on Domodedovo and Zhukovsky, two airports serving the Moscow region, from just after 8 a.m. local time, Russian state media agency TASS reported, citing Russia’s federal air transport agency.

CNN is reaching out to Musk and Trump’s teams about the call, which was first reported by Axios.
Trump’s victory comes at a precarious moment in the conflict for Kyiv as Russia makes gains in the eastern Donbas region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to capture in full.
Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump cast doubt on continued US commitment to Kyiv as the war drags on more than two and half years after Russian forces invaded. He has also made comments that suggest the US could pressure Ukraine into an uneasy truce with Russia.
Musk – whose pro-Trump super PAC spent more than $118 million in the 2024 campaign – has pitched himself to lead a broad effort to slash spending inside the federal government.
He also has benefitted from billions of dollars worth of federal contracts, including from NASA, the military and other US government agencies.
The billionaire’s inclusion on Trump’s call with Zelensky raises questions about what his influence will look like in the incoming administration.
The military contractor
In Ukraine, Musk’s Starlink internet service has provided a significant frontline advantage to Ukraine’s smaller military since the 2022 invasion, permitting its forces to share real-time drone feeds between units, and communicate in areas where combat has disrupted cellphone service.
Starlink was a game changer for the country’s beleaguered frontline forces, endearing Musk to the Ukrainians at the time because his company SpaceX funded the service.
But that relationship soured as Musk complained about the cost of providing that service, and reports emerged that Starlink access was being restricted in areas like Russia-occupied Crimea. The Pentagon later announced in June 2023 that it would pay for Starlink in Ukraine.
Questions about Musk’s influence in the war also began to mount amid a rise in Ukrainian sightings of Russian uses of the satellite internet service.
A 2023 biography on Musk written by Walter Isaacson said the billionaire secretly ordered his engineers to turn off his company’s Starlink satellite communications network near the Crimean coast in 2022 to disrupt a Ukrainian sneak attack on the Russian naval fleet.
Musk’s decision, which left Ukrainian officials begging him to turn the satellites back on, was driven by an acute fear that Russia would respond to a Ukrainian attack on Crimea with nuclear weapons – a fear driven home by Musk’s conversations with senior Russian officials, according to Isaacson.
Musk responded to the book excerpt on X, which he owns, by asserting that the Starlink service provided by his company SpaceX was never active over Crimea and that the Ukrainian government made an “emergency request” to him to turn on service.
There have also been concerns about Musk’s reported links with hostile foreign leaders.
Some US officials have raised counterintelligence concerns in the last year about Musk’s interactions with US adversaries like Russia, but the US intelligence community is wary of looking into those interactions because Musk is an American citizen, an official familiar with the matter previously told CNN.
A September Wall Street Journal report said the SpaceX founder and Putin have been in “regular contact” since late 2022, saying they had discussed “personal topics, business and geopolitical tensions.”
It raised national security concerns as SpaceX’s relationships with NASA and the US military may have granted Musk access to sensitive government information and US intelligence.
Musk did not respond to the Journal’s requests for comment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the newspaper that Musk and Putin have only had one telephone call in which they discussed “space as well as current and future technologies.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/biden-administration-american-military-contractors-deploy-ukraine/index.html,Biden administration to allow American military contractors to deploy to Ukraine for first time since Russia’s invasion,2024-11-08 18:14:08,"The Biden administration has lifted a de facto ban on American military contractors deploying to Ukraine to help the country’s military maintain and repair US-provided weapons systems, particularly F16 fighter jets and Patriot air defense systems, an official with direct knowledge of the plan told CNN.
The new policy, approved earlier this month before the election, would allow the Pentagon to provide contracts to American companies for work inside Ukraine for the first time since Russia invaded in 2022. Officials said they hope it will speed up the maintenance and repairs of weapons systems being used by the Ukrainian military.
It is not clear whether Donald Trump will keep the policy in place when he takes office in January. Trump has said he hopes to end the war between Ukraine and Russia “within 24 hours” of returning to power.
“In order to help Ukraine repair and maintain military equipment provided by the US and its allies, DoD (Department of Defense) is soliciting bids for a small number of contractors who will help Ukraine maintain the assistance we’ve already provided,” a defense official said.
“These contractors will be located far from the front lines and they will not be fighting Russian forces. They will help Ukrainian Armed Forces rapidly repair and maintain US provided equipment as needed so it can be quickly returned to the front lines.”
The defense official confirmed that the US is moving forward with the plan because several of the systems the US has provided Ukraine, particularly F-16s and Patriots, “require specific technical expertise to maintain.”
The shift marks another significant change in the Biden administration’s Ukraine policy, as the US looks for ways to give Ukraine’s military an upper hand against Russia. The Pentagon is expected to start listing the contracts online soon, the official said.
Over the last two years, Biden has insisted that all Americans, and particularly US troops, stay far away from the Ukrainian frontlines. The White House has been determined to limit both the danger to Americans and the perception, particularly by Russia, that the US military is engaged in combat there. The State Department has explicitly warned Americans against traveling to Ukraine since 2022.
As a result, US-provided military equipment that has sustained significant damage in combat has had to be transported out of the country to Poland, Romania, or other NATO countries for repairs, a process which takes time. US troops have also been available to help the Ukrainians with more routine maintenance and logistics, but only from afar via video chat or secure phone—an arrangement that has come with inherent limitations, since US troops and contractors are not able to work directly on the systems.
Allowing experienced, US government-funded American contractors to maintain a presence in Ukraine means they will be able to help fix damaged, high-value equipment much faster, officials have told CNN. One advanced system that officials say will likely require regular maintenance is the F-16 fighter jet, which Ukraine received earlier this year.
Companies bidding for the contracts would be required to develop robust risk mitigation plans to reduce threats to their employees, officials told CNN.
“The Department made this decision after careful risk assessment and in coordination with interagency stakeholders,” the defense official said. “Each US contractor, organization or company will be responsible for the safety and security of their employees and will be required to include risk mitigation plans as part of their bids.”
Current and former officials familiar said the policy change will not result in the kind of major American contractor presence that existed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, it would likely result in anywhere from a few dozen to a couple hundred contractors working in Ukraine at a time.
“It is worth noting that there already are a wide array of American companies who have personnel in Ukraine fulfilling contracts for the Ukrainian government, so this will not lead to a substantial increase of employees of US companies working on the ground in Ukraine,” the defense official said.

Trump’s team, however, has actively skipped a series of key deadlines during the initial planning process which could complicate matters between now and his inauguration.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Election
President Joe Biden will address the nation today at 11 a.m. ET following Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to President-elect Donald Trump. Biden’s address comes a day after Harris delivered her concession speech, promising to keep up the “fight that fueled this campaign.” In her 12-minute remarks, she acknowledged the stinging loss while committing to a peaceful transfer of power. Meanwhile, Trump is ready to move on his agenda and could announce staff picks within days, sources said, as his allies are already jockeying for high-powered spots in his administration. As Trump prepared his next steps, CNN reported that special counsel Jack Smith was in talks with the DOJ about winding down the federal cases against the president-elect.
2. Ukraine
Ukraine is bracing for the implications of a second Trump presidency and a likely dramatic reduction in US support. Under the Biden administration, the US has provided tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine — and plans to surge as much support as possible to Kyiv before Trump takes office. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have cast strong doubts on a continued US commitment to Kyiv as the war drags on more than two and half years after Russian forces invaded. Trump’s election victory comes as Russia is said to be bolstering its manpower with North Korean forces. As many as 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia’s Kursk region and are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, US officials have warned.
3. Climate crisis
New data confirms 2024 will be the hottest year on record and the first calendar year to exceed the Paris Agreement threshold — devastating news for the planet that comes as America chooses a president who has promised to undo its climate progress both at home and abroad. Nearly all the world’s countries pledged to strive to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius in the Paris Agreement. They warn at that level, the human-caused climate crisis — fueled by heat-trapping fossil fuel pollution — begins to exceed the ability of humans and the natural world to adapt. Copernicus data released Wednesday shows 2024 is “virtually certain” to shoot above that threshold. Trump, a noted climate denier, pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement during his first term and has vowed to do it again in his second.
4. Severe weather
Around 27 million people in California are under Red Flag warnings, which are used to describe “extreme and life-threatening fire behavior.” In Ventura County, firefighters are conducting rescues as they battle the Mountain Fire moving at a dangerously fast speed in a dense suburban neighborhood northwest of Los Angeles. Earlier this week, forecasters warned conditions appear concerningly similar to those responsible for “some of the worst fires in Southern California history.” Separately, Hurricane Rafael slammed into Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane Wednesday before losing some strength as it passed over the island and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Rafael, which caused the island’s power grid to crash, is the fifth major hurricane of the year in the Atlantic and the strongest this late in the year since 2020.
5. Elon Musk
Billionaire Elon Musk went all-in supporting Trump’s campaign and now faces both positives and negatives from his election win. On Wednesday, investors bet that Trump’s victory would also be a win for Musk’s major public holding, Tesla, sending shares of his electric vehicle maker up an immediate 13% at the market open, and ending the session up nearly 15%. This made Musk $15 billion richer on paper and marked a massive return on the $119 million he donated to Trump. But much of Musk’s net worth can be traced to the government support his companies, such as Tesla and SpaceX, have received over the years. Even if some of the support for electric vehicles gets trimmed or cut off completely, as is likely during Trump’s second term, Musk’s wealth will remain firmly intact.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/europe/zelensky-north-korean-troops-russia-putin-intl-hnk/index.html,Zelensky confirms deadly clashes with North Korean troops as Putin says he’s willing to talk with Trump,2024-11-07 00:00:00,"North Korean troops deployed to Russia’s Kursk region have fought Kyiv’s forces on the battlefield, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday, adding that the clashes resulted in fatalities.
Zelensky said 11,000 North Korean soldiers are in the region, where Ukraine’s three-month military incursion into Russian territory has stalled.
“Eleven thousand North Korean soldiers or soldiers of the North Korean army are currently present on the territory of the Russian Federation in the border with Ukraine on the north of our country in the Kursk region,” Zelensky told reporters at the European Political Community summit in Budapest, Hungary, on Thursday.
“Some of these troops have already taken part in hostilities against the Ukrainian military. Yes, there are already losses, this is a fact.”
He did not specify which side suffered the losses.
The New York Times reported earlier this week that a number of North Korean troops had been killed in a limited engagement with Russian and Ukrainian forces, citing senior US and Ukrainian officials.
The announcement of their use in combat comes as the United States and its allies weigh how to respond to the escalating military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang.
Ukraine and its NATO allies are also gauging how the reelection of US President-elect Donald Trump will impact the balance of the war and are bracing for the possibility of a dramatic reduction in US support two-and-a-half years after Moscow invaded.
On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first public comments on the US election, saying he is ready for dialogue with the Republican president-elect and noted that Trump’s comments on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine “deserve attention at the very least.”
“We’re ready,” the Russian leader said when asked whether he would hold talks with Trump, while addressing a discussion forum in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi.
Putin congratulated Trump on his election victory and praised his “courageous” conduct following an assassination attempt in July.
Trump has said he would end the war “in 24 hours” and suggested that Ukraine should have “given up a little bit” to Moscow.
Throughout his election campaign, Trump and his running mate JD Vance cast strong doubts on continued US commitment to Kyiv and made comments that suggest the US could pressure Ukraine into an uneasy truce with Russia.
Zelensky has repeatedly pushed back at suggestions of making concessions to Russia.
Trump has not elaborated on how he would quickly end the war, but former CNN Moscow Bureau Chief Jill Dougherty said it “essentially would freeze everything in place.”
“Which means that the Russians would be holding the Ukrainian territory that they have, that they’ve won, and then they would somehow come to territorial concessions,” including Ukraine likely giving up Donbas and Crimea, according to Dougherty, adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies.
Russia escalates attacks in Ukraine
Trump’s election to a second term comes at a precarious moment in the war. Ukraine is under fierce pressure on the front lines, where its army chief has warned his forces are facing “one of the most powerful Russian offensives” since the start of the war.
Moscow is also unleashing near-constant waves of long-range drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and firing decoy drones without warheads to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses, according to a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air force.
Zelensky warned Monday that since last fall Moscow had increased tenfold its attacks using Iranian-made Shahed drones, and in the capital there has only been one night without a drone attack since September 1.
The Ukrainian president said from Budapest Thursday that world leaders are not listening hard enough to his pleas to allow Kyiv to use long-range weapons as it faces a “new wave of escalation” involving “the army of another state in the war against Ukraine.”
To counter Ukraine’s surprise Kursk offensive – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – Putin has bolstered his military’s manpower with North Korean forces, according to the US, South Korea and Ukraine.
US officials had warned that around 10,000 North Korean troops are in the Kursk region and would be expected to enter combat against Ukraine. But Zelensky fears a greater role for North Korean troops if its allies fail to exert more pressure on Putin.
“We believe that if we do not use appropriate weapons and political pressure on the Russian Federation, the next step may be much more use of the North Korean contingent,” he said.",['Helen Regan'],en

As well as drastically increasing the number of strikes, Russia has begun to fire decoy drones without warheads to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses. Decoy drones carry a “3D-printed ball wrapped in foil” to imitate the warhead of an Iran-made Shahed-136 drone, Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air defenses, told CNN.
These cheaper drones confuse Ukraine’s air defenses, which may shoot down decoy drones instead of ones carrying a lethal warhead. Decoy drones now account for as many as half of all Russian drones fired at Ukraine, Ihnat said.
The Russian army has been pounding Ukraine throughout the war, but the moves signal a change in Moscow’s tactics following Donald Trump’s reelection as president, who could pull support. Meanwhile, Ukraine is under fierce pressure on the eastern frontlines, where its army chief has warned his forces are facing “one of the most powerful Russian offensives” since the start of the war.
Night after night, residents in Kyiv and across the country have been kept awake by the sound of explosions and the continuous buzzing of drones. Air raid sirens blasted in Kyiv for around 50 hours in September, 80 hours in October and more than 30 hours in the first week of November alone.
In the capital, there has only been one night without a drone attack since September 1.
“Their goal is to break us morally,” Vadym Naustinov, a 32-year-old copywriter living in the center of Kyiv, told CNN on Thursday. He said he has developed a “system” for coping with constant air attacks.
“If I hear drones flying or realize that the explosions are getting closer, I quickly run to the subway,” he said, which have been used throughout the war as a bomb shelter. “If I realize that the explosions are close by, and Shahed is near my house, so I won’t have time to get to the subway, I hide in the corridor or bathroom. I just hide, wait and hope that I will survive.”
Shrapnel from downed Russian drones injured at least two people and damaged several buildings in Kyiv after an attack overnight into Thursday, said Serhiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration. “It was a massive attack,” Popko said, with the attack coming “in waves, from different directions” and at “different altitudes.”
Hours later, Russia launched another air attack on the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least four people and injuring 18 others, including a four-month-old girl, local officials said. “They enjoy people’s death there,” Zelensky said on Telegram.
Zelensky on Monday said Russia has increased by tenfold its Iranian-made Shahed drone attacks on Ukraine. “This terror is increasing every month,” he said earlier this week.
As Russia steps up its strikes, Ukraine is bracing for the potential withdrawal of support from the United States following Trump’s reelection. Throughout his campaign, the Republican now-president-elect cast strong doubts on continued US commitment to Kyiv as the war rages on more than two-and-a-half years after Moscow invaded.
In his September presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump refused to say he was committed to Ukraine defeating Russia. Later that month, he suggested that Ukraine should have “given up a little bit” to Moscow.
Zelensky was swift to congratulate Trump on his victory, saying Wednesday that he appreciates the president-elect’s commitment to “peace through strength,” a cornerstone of his foreign policy.
“I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,” Zelensky wrote on social media.
Wednesday also marked the third month of Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, a bold and unexpected cross-border attack that sought to divert Russian troops from Ukraine’s embattled east.
“This is our contribution to ensuring that everyone in the world sees: Ukraine can change the course of this war to make those responsible for the war feel real pressure. True peace is only achieved by those who are truly brave,” Zelensky said Wednesday.
To counter Ukraine’s offensive – which marked the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – Russian President Vladimir Putin has bolstered his military’s manpower with North Korean forces, in the latest sign of Moscow’s alliance with Pyongyang.
As many as 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia’s Kursk region and are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, US officials have warned.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/europe/analysis-ukraine-trump-election-intl-latam/index.html,Ukraine is forced to confront a brutal Trump reality that it hoped would never happen,2024-10-30 00:00:00,"Bets were hedged, upsides conjured and insurance policies crafted. But ultimately, most hoped it would not happen.
Ukraine and its NATO allies have had for months to entertain the idea of a Trump victory, juggling conceits of a strongman US president who might be a yet tougher ally, a dealmaker who might bring a favorable peace, or fresh eyes who might see a new end to a fatiguing war.
This was but a comforting fiction: The road ahead for Kyiv is extremely stark. There should be no enduring mystery about what a Trump presidency means for Ukraine. Donald Trump has said he would end the war “in 24 hours,” but not how. He also said that “Zelensky should never have let that war start,” and dubbed him “one of the greatest salesmen I have ever seen” who gets $100 billion on every visit to Congress.
As of this morning, the fact these statements are wild exaggerations ceased to really matter. They became the warped lens through which the president-elect of the United States will perceive the largest conflict in Europe since the Nazis. Trump may appoint a cabinet that mildly adjusts the pace or tone of his instincts, but in the end he wants out. It doesn’t matter that strategically Ukraine’s war has so far provided the Pentagon with a comparatively cheap means of degrading its second greatest adversary at no cost to American life. It is an anathema to two of Trump’s first term dislikes: costly US military engagement abroad, and upsetting Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Kremlin’s initial response – that US-Russia relations could not get any worse than they are now under President Joe Biden – surely belies glee. The year ahead was for Russia, according to most analysis, a careful gamble. Moscow has been positioning forces on the hilltops around Ukraine’s military hubs in the Donbas – near Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, Chasiv Yar – to enable this winter the punishing squeeze of Kyiv out of the Donetsk region.
Success in Donetsk could leave the path to major cities like Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia wide open, making the Ukrainian capital suddenly very vulnerable, and likely tipping the scales of the war. Yet the clock has been ticking on Russia’s efforts. Western officials have suggested that its casualty rate – of perhaps 1,200 dead or injured a day – is unsustainable without another major, unpopular Russian mobilization, and that next year Moscow could see a genuine crunch in armor production and ammunition.
Putin played these recent cards hoping Trump would win, on the sure bet he would remain a man of instinct – isolationist and distrustful of America’s long-term alliances.
Trump is erratic and unpredictable, especially with complex and time-consuming matters like foreign conflicts. He prefers the fast fix of just leaving Afghanistan to the Taliban, or a Singapore face-to-face with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, or a drone strike on Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qasem Soleimani. We may never learn if he really studied the direction he imposes on Ukraine, or if he just never again wants to talk about the war, or spend money on it.
Whatever the speed or detail of the Trump approach, the damage will still be palpable in the weeks ahead. I recall in December of last year the massive blow to morale among Ukrainian troops when Congress stalled US military aid for around six months. Frontline troops told me they would have to flee their positions without that help, even if they knew the Biden administration still wanted – in principle – to have their back. Now they must deal with the tables turned: the possibility that some aid still drips through from the Pentagon and European NATO allies, but that the Trump administration has instead taken a hostile posture at Kyiv’s spine.
Furthermore, Trump enters the White House at perhaps the most perilous time for Kyiv since the start of the war. Several analyses of the front line show Ukraine has lost ground at an almost unparalleled pace in October; losing small villages that are inconsequential by themselves, yet in the round amount to a strategic setback that leaves the east acutely vulnerable.
There has long been a policy flaw in NATO’s approach; the Biden administration did not want to arm Ukraine forcefully enough that Russia might be militarily defeated, as it feared wider escalation. But Biden also could also not countenance letting Russia prevail. Instead the alliance sked Ukraine to endure, in the hope eventually Putin would crumble. It was the messy contradiction at the heart of the support for Kyiv, yet better than asking Ukraine to surrender.
Without the will to fight – the belief that the battle is winnable – it is near impossible to ask Ukrainians to sit under shellfire in a trench, or drive their armor at the deadly fire of enemy positions. Nobody wants to be the last soldier to die in a war; nobody wants to lose their life fighting to protect a family who will likely live under Russian occupation anyway.
Trump’s victory may also complicate the very position of Zelensky. For years Zelensky has – to paraphrase Trump – been foremost an outstanding salesman of Ukraine’s cause. Now he is weighed down with immense baggage from Trump’s first term when he was emboiled in Trump’s requests to investigate the Biden family. Can Zelensky still be that salesman? Is a fresh face in Bankova more likely to garner military aid, or strike a viable peace deal?
Those tired of the Ukraine war – be they Kyiv ally or frontline soldier – should still not embrace the idea of a Trump-backed deal. Moscow has proven, in Syria in 2013 and Ukraine in 2015, that it negotiates to buy time to prepare for, or fulfill, its military goals. Putin will accept whatever territorial gains he can concretize – he already has the gains at the negotiating table. But he will then regroup, and not stop. He has sold the war domestically as Russia facing the massed ranks of the entire NATO alliance. An overheated Russian economy, astronomical death toll and retooling of Russia’s industrial base, all in service of that supposed fight, cannot simply be undone. Putin is increasingly needy of the war to retain his grip on power.
This is apparent in his maximalist behavior towards Russia’s neighbours in the last month. The recent turmoil in Georgia and Moldova, where pro-Russian forces have challenged pro-European movements with limited success, may see yet greater intervention from Russia in the months ahead. Putin is unlikely to suddenly abandon his hunger for greater regional influence. Remember his original motivation: This war began because he wanted to occupy Ukraine, and keep it out of NATO and the European Union. The Russian blood expended over nearly three years likely demands a greater victory than simply keeping the territorial gains it already has.
One vital lesson of the war will meanwhile face a grave assault. For the past two years, Putin’s fiercest opponents have pushed the key idea that we need no longer fear Russia; that the Kremlin fanned the fear of its hulking Bear as a psychological weapon to make up for its military decrepitude. Ukraine’s unexpected resistance showed that fear was misplaced, and that Moscow had struggled to defeat a neighbor it once scorned as unable to fight.
Now a Trump White House may ask the world to quickly swallow an apparently similar contention that is terrifyingly different: that the West should not be afraid of Russia as it does not really mean much harm. That would be Putin’s greatest victory, and the West’s sorest weakness.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/trump-election-ukraine-war-russia-intl/index.html,Trump’s victory could mean US withdraws support for Ukraine in war with Russia,2024-11-06 10:45:26,"With the reelection of Donald Trump, Ukraine may soon have to adjust to a dramatic reduction in US support that could have a decisive impact on the war with Russia.
Throughout his campaign, the Republican president-elect and his running mate, JD Vance, have cast strong doubts on continued US commitment to Kyiv as the war drags on more than two and half years after Russian forces invaded. Moreover, Trump has made comments that suggest the US could pressure Ukraine into an uneasy truce with Russia.
Trump’s victory comes at a precarious moment in the conflict for Kyiv. Russia has steadily been making gains in the eastern Donbas region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to capture in full.
Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a statement on Telegram on Saturday that the situation on the front line “remains difficult” and that certain areas “require constant renewal of resources of Ukrainian units.”
Meanwhile, Russia is understood to be bolstering its manpower with North Korean forces. As many as 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia’s Kursk region and are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, US officials have warned.
Under the Biden administration, the US has provided tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, in the form of both weapons and budget assistance. The administration plans to continue to surge as much support as possible to Kyiv before Trump takes office.
Trump has repeatedly praised Putin – and repeatedly criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he has a complicated history. Trump’s efforts to leverage US military aid to Ukraine to force Zelensky to investigate the former president’s political rivals were the key focus of Trump’s first impeachment in 2019.
Zelensky congratulated Trump on Wednesday and said he appreciates Trump’s commitment to “peace through strength.”
“We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership. We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States,” Zelensky wrote in a social media post. “We are interested in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.”
Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Ukraine-Russia war would not have started if he had been president. He has also vowed to end the war, sometimes even claiming he would stop the years-long conflict before taking office. In July, he said he could settle the conflict in one day.
In his September presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump refused to say he was committed to Ukraine defeating Russia. Later that month, he suggested that Ukraine should have “given up a little bit” to Moscow, saying at a campaign event that “any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”
“If they made a bad deal, it would have been much better. They would have given up a little a bit and everybody would be living,” Trump said.
Just days after those comments, when Trump met with Zelensky in New York City, he stressed that he would work to get a good deal for “both sides.”
“We have a very good relationship, and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin. And I think if we win, we’re going to get it resolved very quickly,” Trump said.
“I think long before I, before January 20, before I would take the presidency – it’s January 20 – but long before that, I think that we can work out something that’s good for both sides. It’s time,” he added.
Zelensky has drawn up a “victory plan,” and has said Ukraine is not opposed to negotiations, but they must be from “a position of strength.” At a press conference in late October, the Ukrainian president said that “Trump talks a lot, but I didn’t hear him say he would reduce support for Ukraine.”
Zelensky said Wednesday that in their September meeting, he and Trump “discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine.”
Still, in an interview with South Korea’s KBS, Zelensky acknowledged that “the next US president may strengthen or weaken support for Ukraine.”
“If that support weakens, Russia will seize more territory, it would prevent us from winning this war. That is the reality. Our stance isn’t about territorial compromises but exploring potential diplomatic paths that rely on the US maintaining its commitment. A genuine desire from the United States to end this war swiftly is crucial,” he said.
Ahead of the election, the US and its allies sought ways to “Trump-proof” that support. Earlier this year, NATO announced it would establish a mission to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine – an effort that has been largely led by the US. The Biden administration put forward $20 billion of the G7’s $50 billion loan package to Ukraine, which is also funded by frozen Russian assets.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/europe/moldova-election-sandu-putin-interference-intl/index.html,Moldova election: Putin’s latest meddling effort failed. It’s unlikely to stop him trying again,2024-11-04 17:06:37,"As Moldova’s pro-EU president Maia Sandu celebrated victory in the early hours of Monday morning, in an election campaign she claimed involved “unprecedented” interference by Moscow, pro-Kremlin voices in Russia turned to the next page in their playbook: casting doubt on the result.
Sandu narrowly won a second presidential term in Sunday’s runoff vote, beating former prosecutor Alexandr Stoianoglu. According to Moldova’s Central election commission, with 100% of votes counted, Sandu had 55% of the total.
Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament, lamented the “disgraceful organization” of the election in a post on Telegram Monday, claiming the opportunity to vote overseas was “exclusively” provided to those who supported “one candidate” (implying Moldova provided more opportunities to vote to the diaspora in European countries, who typically favor Sandu, than to Moldovan citizens in Russia, who may have favored her opponent, who had promised friendlier ties to Moscow).
Another senior Russian senator, Andrey Klishas, took a similar line, suggesting Moldova had actively falsified the diaspora vote, which proved decisive in Sandu’s victory. “You count the votes, understand how many are lacking from the ‘correct’ candidate, and bring in the necessary number from overseas polling stations,” he wrote on Telegram Monday.
The Kremlin has officially denied accusations by Moldova that it orchestrated and funded a widespread interference campaign ranging from disinformation and cyber attacks to simple vote-buying to try to influence not only the presidential election but a referendum on October 20 on whether to enshrine Moldova’s intention to join the European Union in its constitution. That referendum secured a “yes” vote with a less than 1% margin.
And yet Moscow had a lot to gain from installing a Russia sympathizer in Chisinau and upending Moldova’s path to EU membership.
Russia already has a small military presence in Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway republic in Moldova that borders Ukraine. Geographically, that region offers a potential staging ground for Russian attacks on Ukraine. But the concern for Moldova is that Russian intentions go beyond Ukraine.
In February, Transnistria appealed to Moscow for “protection” from what they claimed were threats from Moldovan authorities, echoing Russian claims of a similar appeal from Ukraine’s Donbas region, which Moscow used as part of its justification for its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Another region in Moldova’s south, Gagauzia, is also keen to build closer ties with Moscow. Its leader, a regular visitor to Russia, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in March.
In his congratulatory note to Sandu Monday, US President Joe Biden declared “Russia failed” in its attempt to undermine Moldova’s democracy. But both the tight victory for Sandu and Moldova’s electoral calendar in the year ahead offer clear incentives for Moscow to keep up the pressure.
News coverage in Russia is already emphasizing the fact that Sandu narrowly lost the election within Moldova but secured victory due to an unprecedented turnout by Moldova’s large expat population — more than 80% of which voted for her.
In her victory speech, Sandu acknowledged the divisions in the country, promising to be “the president for all of you.”
She now has less than a year to address those divisions before parliamentary elections next summer, which many fear could be another target for Moscow.
Lithuania’s foreign ministry wrote on X Monday, “With parliamentary elections around the corner, (the) EU should do its best to help Moldova investigate all of Russia’s malign interference & bring its perpetrators to justice.”
Recent parliamentary elections in Georgia, where the pro-Russian Georgian Dream party secured victory amid widespread reports of Russian interference, may have also given Moscow a taste of success.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is breathing a sigh of relief at the results of Moldova’s election.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky immediately called to congratulate Sandu, vowing to strengthen the two country’s partnership.
And yet, Moldova looks at Ukraine with growing trepidation. Russia is currently advancing in the east in what Ukraine’s commander-in-chief described as “one of the most powerful Russian offensives since the start of the war.”
Attacks on Odesa and Ukraine’s Danube ports have already brought the war far too close for comfort for Chisinau.
Overnight into Monday, as Moldova counted its final votes, Romanian fighter jets took off less than 40 miles from Moldova’s southern border after Russian drones approached its airspace. If Russia’s gains turn from tactical to strategic, Moldova faces a threat much bigger than election interference.",['Clare Sebastian'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/europe/moldova-election-sandu-russia-intl-latam/index.html,Moldova election: Maia Sandu wins 2nd term in runoff overshadowed by Russian meddling claims,2024-11-03 00:00:00,"CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldova’s pro-Western President Maia Sandu has won a second term in a pivotal presidential runoff against a Russia-friendly opponent, in a race that was overshadowed by claims of Russian interference, voter fraud, and intimidation in the European Union candidate country.
With nearly 99% of votes counted in the second round of the presidential election held Sunday, Sandu had 55% of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Commission, or CEC, compared to 45% for Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was backed by the pro-Russia Party of Socialists.
The result will be a major relief for the pro-Western government, which strongly backed Sandu’s candidacy, and her push for closer Western ties on Moldova’s path toward the EU.
“Moldova, you are victorious! Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova!” Sandu said after claiming victory after midnight.
She went on to claim that her country’s vote had faced an “unprecedented attack” through alleged schemes including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference “by hostile forces from outside the country” and criminal groups.
“You have shown that nothing can stand in the way of the people’s power when they choose to speak through their vote,” she added.
Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that “everyone’s voice deserves respect” and that he hopes “from now on, we will put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us.” It isn’t clear if he has publicly commented on his electoral defeat.
When polls closed locally at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), turnout stood at more than 1.68 million people — about 54% of eligible voters, according to the CEC. Moldova’s large diaspora, which cast ballots in record numbers of more than 325,000 voted, heavily in favor of Sandu in the runoff.
In the first round held Oct. 20, Sandu obtained 42% of the ballot but failed to win an outright majority over the second place Stoianoglo. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security and has a four-year term.
European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu on her victory, by writing on X: “It takes a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you’ve faced in this election.”
Allegations of vote-buying and Russian interference
Moldova’s diaspora played a key role in the presidential vote and in a nationwide referendum held on Oct. 20, when a narrow majority of 50.35% voted to secure Moldova’s path toward EU membership. But the results of the ballots including Sunday’s vote were overshadowed by allegations of a major vote-buying scheme and voter intimidation.
Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldova’s judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process.
On Sunday, Moldovan police said they had “reasonable evidence” of organized transportation of voters — illegal under the country’s electoral code — to polling stations from within the country and from overseas, and are “investigating and registering evidence in connection with air transport activities from Russia to Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey.”
“Such measures are taken to protect the integrity of the electoral process and to ensure that every citizen’s vote is cast freely without undue pressure or influence,” police said.
Moldova’s foreign ministry said on Sunday afternoon that polling stations in Frankfurt, Germany, and Liverpool and Northampton in the U.K. had been targeted by false bomb threats, which “intended only to stop the voting process.”
Stanislav Secrieru, the president’s national security adviser, wrote on X: “We are seeing massive interference by Russia in our electoral process,” which he warned had a “high potential to distort the outcome” of the vote.
Secrieru later added that the national voter record systems were being targeted by “ongoing coordinated cyberattacks” to disrupt links between domestic polling stations and those abroad, and that cybersecurity teams were “working to counter these threats and ensure system continuity.”
Moldova’s Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that people throughout the country had received “anonymous death threats via phone calls” in what he called “an extreme attack” to scare voters in the former Soviet republic, which has a population of about 2.5 million people.
After casting her ballot in Chisinau, Sandu told reporters: “Thieves want to buy our vote, thieves want to buy our country, but the power of the people is infinitely greater.”
Outside a polling station in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, 20-year-old medical student Silviana Zestrea said the runoff would be a “definitive step” toward Moldova’s future.
“People need to understand that we have to choose a true candidate that will fulfill our expectations,” she said. “Because I think even if we are a diaspora now, none of us actually wanted to leave.”
Moldovan police expose a scheme allegedly plotted by a convicted oligarch
In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering. Shor denies any wrongdoing.
Prosecutors say $39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Anti-corruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over $2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down.
In one case in Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5% voted in favor of the EU, a physician was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained “conclusive evidence,” including financial transfers from the same Russian bank.
On Saturday, at a church in Comrat, the capital of Gagauzia, Father Vasilii told The Associated Press that he had urged people to go and vote because it’s a “civic obligation” and that they do not name any candidates.
“We use the goods the country offers us — light, gas,” he said. “Whether we like what the government does or not, we must go and vote. … The church always prays for peace.”
On Thursday, prosecutors raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes.
Moldova’s EU future at stake
Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told AP that whatever the outcome of the second round, it “will not deflate” geopolitical tensions. “On the contrary, I expect geopolitical polarization to be amplified by the campaign for the 2025 legislative elections.”
Moldovan law enforcement needs more resources and better-trained staff working at a faster pace to tackle voter fraud, he added, to “create an environment in which anyone tempted to either buy or sell votes knows there will be clear and fast consequences.”
Savlina Adasan, a 21-year-old economics student in Bucharest, said she voted for Sandu and cited concerns about corruption and voters uninformed about the two candidates.
“We want a European future for our country,” she said, adding that it offers “many opportunities, development for our country … and I feel like if the other candidate wins, then it means that we are going 10 steps back as a country.”
A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, and a parliamentary election will be held in 2025. Moldova watchers warn that next year’s vote could be Moscow’s main target.
In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau.",[],en

Russia has steadily been making gains in the eastern Donbas region, which Russia’s President Vladimir Putin aims to capture in full. Reuters, citing open source data, reported that Russia has been advancing at its fastest pace in at least a year.
Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said the situation on the front line “remains difficult” and certain areas “require constant renewal of resources of Ukrainian units” in a statement on Telegram Saturday morning.
Kyiv’s forces, he said, are “holding back one of the most powerful Russian offensives since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.”
Over the weekend, Russia claimed the capture of two settlements in the Donetsk region - Kurakhivka and Vyshneve. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed either claim.
Vyshneve is close to Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in the east and a major target of the Russian offensive.
Meanwhile Russian drone attacks continue, with Ukraine bracing for what could be a difficult winter with energy infrastructure already badly hit.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched over 50 drone attacks at Ukraine overnight into Sunday. Over the past week, Russia has dropped more than 900 bombs on Ukraine, and launched about 30 missiles and nearly 500 Shahed drones in various regions of Ukraine, he added.
Most of the strikes were directed against civilian objects and critical infrastructure, the statement said.
Zelensky spent recent weeks trying to drum up additional support but has so far been unable to secure consent to fire deeper into Russia.
He repeated his plea for Western aid, adding in the statement that “all of these strikes would not have been possible if we had sufficient support from the world.”
Zelensky warned that “Russia is gradually increasing this activity” and added that Moscow still has the ability to “use Western components for this purpose.”
“All this is supplied to Russia from abroad,” Zelensky continued. “And unfortunately, it comes from companies in China, Europe, and America - a lot of micro-contributions to the constant Russian terror.”
The developments come at a precarious time for Ukraine.
The US presidential election next week will determine America’s policy on Ukraine, which currently stands at a crossroads. If elected, Kamala Harris is expected to largely continue the supportive policies of the Biden administration. Taking a drastically different position, Donald Trump has suggested he will end support for Kyiv’s war effort and claimed he could settle the war “in one day.”",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/02/europe/moldova-presidential-election-second-round-russia-intl/index.html,Moldova heads for presidential runoff that could derail path to Europe,2024-11-03 00:00:00,"Moldovans are voting in the second round of a crucial presidential election, which could determine whether the post-Soviet country stays its course toward Europe or lurches back into the Kremlin’s orbit.
Maia Sandu, the pro-Western president, is seeking reelection after guiding Moldova closer to the European Union than ever before while Russia’s war in Ukraine raged near its eastern border.
Sandu secured 42% of the first-round vote, held on the same day as a referendum on EU membership that passed by the thinnest of margins. Both votes were marred by a vast Kremlin-linked vote-buying scheme, which Sandu said amounted to an “unprecedented assault” on Moldova’s democracy.
She faces Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general running for the pro-Russian Party of Socialists. If other Kremlin-friendly parties swing their support behind him, the second round will be extremely close.
In last Sunday’s presidential debate, Sandu – a Harvard-educated former World Bank official who has cut ties with Moscow – called Stoianoglo a “Trojan Horse” seeking to infiltrate the country’s capital, Chisinau, on the Kremlin’s behalf.
Analysts say this is not merely rhetorical. Valeriu Pasha, director of WatchDog.MD, a think tank, told CNN that Sunday’s vote is about “whether we will have a president who is elected by citizens or someone who wins because Russian dirty money paid for it.”
Before last month’s votes, Ilan Shor, a Russian-backed oligarch, offered to pay people for working to elect a Russia-friendly candidate and stop the referendum passing. Sandu said the scheme sought to pay off some 300,000 voters – about 10% of the population.
Despite polling at just over 10% before the election, Stoianoglo won more than 26% of first-round votes. Both the Kremlin and Shor have denied interference, but Moldovan officials have warned the second vote could also be targeted by similar schemes.
Apart from vote-buying, analysts say the first round revealed genuine opposition to Sandu, whose first term has been wracked by successive crises.
“First there was the Covid-19 pandemic, then there was Russia’s war in Ukraine, then there was the gas crisis,” Maksim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN.
Although Sandu has weaned Moldova off Russian gas, it came at a heavy cost to one of Europe’s poorest countries. Inflation briefly rocketed to more than 30%, causing poverty to tick up.
Some have also criticized Sandu’s “cynical” decision to hold the EU referendum on the same day as the presidential election, positioning herself as the only politician capable of bringing Moldova into Europe.
“The plan of the government was that the issue of European integration will drag up the support for Maia Sandu. It turned out the other way round: The discontent with Maia Sandu dragged down the support for European integration,” said Samurokov.
Stoianoglo is attempting to capitalize on discontent with Sandu by keeping one foot in both camps. He has called for a “reset” of relations with Moscow and said he would be willing to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, while maintaining he is committed to joining the EU.
As a result, his platform is a mix of contradictory policies, said Samurokov: “You either support European integration, or you want to promote cooperation with Moscow. It’s very difficult to reconcile.”
Still, Moldovan officials are braced for a second round of voting marred by pro-Russian meddling. A defeat for Sandu would land a crushing blow for Moldova’s hopes of a European future.
A Russia-friendly government could also spell further trouble in Transnistria, a separatist sliver of territory where some 1,500 Russian troops are stationed. Officials have long questioned whether Transnistria could eventually become a second front in the war in Ukraine.
“The worst-case scenario is, if they take full control of the parliament, they gradually liquidate any democratic institutions, including free and fair elections. After that, they will use Moldova as a bridgehead behind Ukraine,” Pasha told CNN.
Moldova’s election will come a week after Georgia’s, another formerly Communist state where Russia is seeking to keep its influence alive.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/europe/ukraine-putin-unlikely-negotiation-us-election/index.html,"Putin unlikely to come to the negotiation table, regardless of who wins US election",2024-11-03 06:00:48,"Russia is watching US policy like a hawk.
That was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s message to reporters last week in Kyiv as he answered a question about Moscow’s willingness to negotiate. “It depends on the elections in the United States,” he said.
If elected, Kamala Harris is expected to largely continue the policies of the Biden administration, which have been supportive of Ukraine despite some friction points, like the use of Western weapons to strike deep inside Russia.
Taking a drastically different position, Donald Trump has suggested he will end support for Kyiv’s war effort and claimed he could settle the war “in one day.” Terms of a peace plan floated by his vice-presidential nominee JD Vance are strikingly similar to Putin’s wish list.
American policy is at a crossroads, but that won’t necessarily translate to a turning point in peace negotiations, analysts say.
That’s because nothing suggests Russia is ready to come to the table, regardless of who ends up in the White House.
“What [Trump] thinks he can do, what leverage he has, is unclear at this point – but I don’t think it’s a quick process,” said Thomas Graham, a Russian foreign policy expert and distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
A reduction in US aid spending could very well translate to changes on the battlefield, though, experts say.
With either potential president, Putin will be looking to exploit what he sees as political dysfunction in the United States, as well as “cracks in Western unity,” Graham told CNN.
Those cracks could come in the form of a Trump administration reducing US aid and taking a lesser role in NATO, or a split US Congress, among other factors. Financial pressures on European allies also play a role, as well as rifts in NATO, with pro-Russian leaderships in member states such as Hungary and Slovakia.
“Absent Western unity, absent a clear demonstration that the West and Ukraine have a common vision of what they’re trying to achieve… Putin has no reason to reconsider what he is doing in Ukraine at this point,” Graham added.
The scope of the war is also too large for a simple negotiation between Moscow and Kyiv, experts say. They argue it’s a much broader conflict between Russia and the West.
For Putin, “Ukraine is just a means to an end, and the end is to further limit US influence in international affairs,” said John Lough, an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the London think tank Chatham House.
“When [Trump’s] advisers explain to him what’s really going on here and the fact that China has played a key role in sustaining Russia’s ability to continue fighting this war… he may feel suddenly very strongly that he’s not so well disposed to Putin,” Lough said, adding that Beijing will perceive any concessions “as a further indication of US weakness.”
That goes against Trump’s tough rhetoric on the threat posed by China.
Attritional war playing into Putin’s hands
Ukraine is already outmanned, and Putin appears ready to accept a high number of casualties. More than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded, according to NATO.
“The enemy is increasing its troops to drive the Ukrainian Armed Forces out of the Kursk region at any cost,” said Oleh Shiryaev, commander of the 225th Separate Assault Battalion that is fighting in Ukraine’s surprise incursion across the Russian border. “Russia’s main element in this war is the number of its troops – these are meaty assaults and offensive actions. They do this in all parts of the frontline.”
In Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, another commander with the Security Service of Ukraine said, “By sending a large number of personnel into battle as cannon fodder, they are trying to gain a foothold in the grey areas of the front.” The officer, who asked to be named only by his call sign “Bankir,” which means accountant, told CNN that a complex system of fortifications in Zaporizhzhia is helping Ukraine defend the frontline.
But Kyiv knows that’s not enough. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s Parliament voted to extend martial law and the draft for an additional 90 days. There are plans to call up an additional 160,000 people, the National Security Council announced.
The Ukrainian servicemen who spoke to CNN said Russia has other advantages too, like countless drones, expensive aircraft and more vehicles that enable fighting during the muddy fall and winter.
Ukraine needs support for both its infantry and its equipment coffers, servicemen said.
“We have ammunition, but as artillerymen say, there is never enough,” said 15th Brigade National Guard Spokesman Vitaliy Milovidov, who is fighting in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces continue to make incremental gains.
If a potential Trump administration cuts US aid, Ukraine would become increasingly outgunned.
European nations are scrambling to increase ammunition production for Ukraine to prevent backsliding, in the event that US support drops off.
But even if US policy continues along the current trajectory, Kyiv’s Western allies don’t appear willing to send the level of resources needed to make major battlefield gains.
“My hunch is that this is going to continue, at a lower intensity possibly, but for a long time,” Chatham House’s Lough added. “A Harris administration certainly wouldn’t sell out the Ukrainians, but it would really test their Ukrainian resolve and whether they are prepared to continue to fight this attritional war.”
That’s why Putin’s strategy also appears aimed at demoralizing Ukraine’s population.
Russia has repeatedly attacked civilians and civilian infrastructure. It has also hammered Ukraine’s energy grid, which exacerbates problems for everyday Ukrainians who will face a winter marred by lack of heating and water.
Analysts say the Ukrainian population is certainly exhausted, but they too don’t appear ready to settle in any way. After the mass killings of civilians in Bucha and Mariupol, the brutal treatment of Ukrainian prisoners in Russian custody, and the forcible deportation of Ukrainian children by the Russian state, they know the brutal realities of Russian occupation.
Zelensky, meanwhile, continues to call for support from both parties. If Trump “just wants to force Ukraine to give up everything and thus reach a deal with Russia, I don’t think that’s possible,” he said Thursday.","['Lauren Kent', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/politics/us-north-korean-troops-combat-ukraine/index.html,US says it expects North Korean troops to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days,2024-10-31 00:00:00,"As many as 8,000 North Korean troops are in Russia’s Kursk region and are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, top US officials announced Thursday.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking alongside Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and their South Korean counterparts in Washington, said the troops have been trained “in artillery, UAVs, basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in frontline operations.”
Although the US has not yet seen the troops engaged in the actual fighting, Blinken warned Thursday that “should these troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.”
The 8,000 North Korean troops now in Kursk represent a majority of the 10,000 the US says were deployed to Russia. The announcement of their impending use in combat comes as the US and its allies weigh how to respond to the escalating military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang.
“We are consulting closely with our allies and partners in other countries in the region on these reckless developments and on our response,” Austin said at Thursday’s press conference. The US will announce additional military support to Ukraine “in the coming days,” Blinken said.
Ukrainian forces have held territory in Kursk since launching a surprise incursion into the Russian border region in August. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called for South Korea to take a more active role in supporting Kyiv, warned Thursday that when the North Korean troops are deployed, “they will be pushed forward, sustaining heavy losses, as Russia tries to minimize its own troop mobilization.”
Asked if he believed Ukraine would be able to hold its territory in Kursk with the additional North Korean forces deployed to the region, Austin said the “answer is yes.”
Russian troops have suffered heavy losses throughout the more than two years of full-scale war against Ukraine. The US defense secretary noted Thursday that the number of North Korean troops sent to Kursk “pales in comparison” to the number of casualties Russia sees regularly.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday praised what he called “very close contacts” with the North Korean military and intelligence services.
“This helps to solve very important tasks for the security of our and your citizens,” Lavrov said at the start of a meeting with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui.
The meeting in Moscow marked the sixth time the Russian and North Korean foreign ministers are meeting this year, according to Lavrov.
On Thursday, Blinken and Austin redoubled their calls for China to use its influence with North Korea to stem its “provocative actions.”
“We’ve had communications with China – in fact, we had a robust conversation just this week, and I think they know well the concerns that we have and the expectations that, both in word and deed, they’ll use the influence that they have to work to curb these activities,” the top US diplomat said. He added that Beijing should be concerned by the deepening cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow.
“We’re very focused on and concerned about what Russia might be doing in order to enhance the (North Korean) capacities, its military capacity – that too should be a real concern to China, because it’s profoundly destabilizing in the region,” Blinken noted.
“I’m surprised by China’s silence” on North Korea’s support for Russia, Zelensky said in an interview with South Korea’s KBS. “I can’t say that China is on our side, but as a regional security guarantor, its silence is striking.”

Russian forces have been advancing on Selydove in the last several weeks, according to frontline reports. It’s part of Russia’s ongoing assault and incremental territorial gains in eastern Ukraine.
Selydove was an important staging area for Ukraine’s defenses and a key foothold to prevent Russia’s advance toward Pokrovsk.
Ukrainian authorities have not yet commented on Russia’s claims of control.
On Sunday, a spokesman for a Ukrainian national guard brigade fighting in Selydove told CNN the town had been “constantly attacked from several directions” for a week.
“[Russia] continues to assault with very large troop numbers. They used reserves from the north of the frontline’s Pokrovsk section to increase pressure on Selydove,” 15th brigade national guard spokesman Vitaliy Milovidov said.
“At the same time, the enemy is not destroying the city’s infrastructure,” he added. “Most likely, they want to keep the town as a foothold for themselves in the future. Selydove is a large town where you can accommodate a large number of people and hide equipment.”
Video released by Russian state media TASS on Tuesday reportedly shows troops raising the Russian flag in Selydove.
Russia also continued aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities overnight into Tuesday.
At least nine Ukrainian people were killed and 46 injured across the country as Russian forces attacked the cities of Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih and the capital Kyiv. In the Odesa region, a 71-year-old man was killed by falling debris following an intercepted Russian missile strike launched by a fighter jet from the Black Sea.","['Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'Kosta Gak', 'Lauren Kent']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/asia/north-korean-soldiers-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html,"North Korean soldiers learning Russian commands and may be sent to Ukraine front lines, South Korean lawmakers say",2024-10-29 07:36:48,"North Korean soldiers may be being readied for a move to the front lines of Russia’s war against Ukraine after being taught basic Russian commands, South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Tuesday, citing the country’s intelligence officials.
About 10,000 North Korean soldiers are receiving military training in eastern Russia, the Pentagon estimated on Monday – up from a previous estimate of 3,000 by the White House.
South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) is now watching for the possibility of “some North Korean personnel, including high-ranking military officials, moving to the front lines,” said lawmakers Lee Seong-kweun and Park Sun-won, who were briefed by the NIS during a closed-door meeting of a parliamentary intelligence committee.
Russia is teaching North Korean soldiers about 100 basic military words like “fire” and “in position,” the lawmakers said.
However, they added, it’s clear that North Korean soldiers are struggling to communicate – and it’s not clear whether they’ll be able to bridge the language gap.
North Korea has also stepped up its security measures – both to protect its dictator Kim Jong Un and to prevent news of the North Korean deployments to Russia from spreading within the highly isolated, impoverished country.
To this end, North Korean officers involved in the Russian effort are banned from using phones, while families of soldiers are told that their loved ones are simply participating in a “military exercise,” the lawmakers said.
Despite these measures, word has spread within North Korea of deployments to Russia – sparking “unrest” in some parts of the country, the lawmakers said.
Some residents and soldiers have voiced fears of possibly being sent to Russia themselves, while others have questioned why they are being sacrificed for a different country, they added.
Last week, Ukraine intercepted Russian transmission channels and released audio, with Russian soldiers heard talking disdainfully about the incoming North Korean soldiers, calling them the “K Battalion” and referring to them as “the f**king Chinese.”
The intercepts also reveal plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean men, which the Russian soldiers are heard in the audio condemning.
“The only thing I don’t understand is that there [should be] three senior officers for 30 people. Where do we get them? We’ll have to pull them out,” one Russian serviceman says.
This could mark the first time North Korea makes a significant intervention in an international conflict. North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries with 1.2 million soldiers, but most of its troops lack combat experience.
The Kremlin had initially dismissed allegations of North Korean troop deployments, but at the BRICS summit in Russia last week, President Vladimir Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country.
North Korea said on Friday that any troop deployment to Russia to aid the war in Ukraine would conform with international law, state media reported, without explicitly confirming such presence. North Korea had previously dismissed such reports.
North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui is now in Russia for her second trip there in six weeks, having departed Pyongyang on Monday. She likely traveled to discuss potentially dispatching more North Korean troops – and what Pyongyang would receive in return, the lawmakers told reporters.
The news also comes as South Korea’s foreign and defense ministers head to Washington to speak with their counterparts, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, for an annual ministerial meeting.","['Jessie Yeung', 'Gawon Bae']",en

Six people were injured in the 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) strike, adding to 13 wounded in an earlier overnight bomb attack on the city.
In the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, a Russian missile struck a three-story residential building, killing one person and wounding at least 11.
President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the strike on Kharkiv’s Derzhprom (State Industry) building, one of the most striking examples of Soviet-era constructivism architecture and dubbed the Soviet Union’s first skyscraper.
Writing on X, he also deplored the attack on Kryvyi Rih, his hometown, and called for renewed efforts to force Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to halt the more than two-and-a-half-year-old war.
“Every handshake with war criminal Putin boosts his confidence. Every pleasant smile convinces him that he can get away with his crimes,” Zelensky wrote.
“Instead of cozying up to him, we must force him into peace through our collective decisiveness.”
Reuters news agency video showed parts of the Derzhprom building reduced to rubble and virtually all of its windows shattered.
“The occupiers have struck an iconic symbol of the city, known to all residents of Kharkiv,” Oleh Syniehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, wrote on Telegram. He said several floors had been destroyed.
The Derzhprom building, placed on the “tentative” list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, was completed in 1928 when Kharkiv was the capital of Soviet Ukraine.
The evening attack also hit a medical facility. Earlier strikes damaged an apartment building and storage space.
Eight were hurt in the city of Chuhuiv just to the southeast, Syniehubov said, an attack prosecutors said involved a multi rocket-launch system was used in Chuhuiv.",[],en

In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Zourabichvili – a pro-Western figure whose powers are largely ceremonial – said the election had been marred by unprecedented levels of interference, which aimed to knock the post-Soviet country from its path toward Europe and keep it within the Kremlin’s orbit.
Tens of thousands of Georgians massed outside the parliament on Monday night, calling for the annulment of Saturday’s parliamentary election that the opposition has said was rigged with Russia’s blessing.
Speaking soon after addressing crowds in the capital, Tbilisi, Zourabichvili said the protesters “are coming very peacefully to say, ‘We have voted, we want our votes to be defended, and we want our European future … to be defended.’”
The Russia-friendly Georgian Dream party, founded by the reclusive billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, claimed victory after a day of voting marred by violence and disorder at polling stations across the country. The Central Election Commission (CEC) said it had secured nearly 54% of the vote.
Asked why she is refusing to recognize the results of the election, Zourabichvili said Georgian Dream had used “all the instruments” at its disposal to rig the election and called for an international investigation.
The election commission told CNN it received 445 district-level complaints of irregularities on election day. On Monday, the United States called for a “full investigation” into the election, citing Georgian Dream’s “misuse of public resources, vote buying and voter intimidation.”
“We encourage Georgia’s governing officials to consider the relationship they want with the Euro-Atlantic community, rather than strengthening policies that are praised by authoritarians,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
Zourabichvili said the election results were difficult to believe because actions taken this year by Georgian Dream have stalled the country’s bid to join the European Union, which polls suggest more than 80% of Georgians support.
“Every move the Georgian government has made this year is clearly designed … to make sure that we don’t get the approval of the European leaders,” Zourabichvili said.
In May, the government passed a “foreign agent” bill, referred to by Georgians as the “Russian law” because of its similarities to legislation passed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Critics say the bill, which requires organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as a “foreign agent,” is designed to shut down watchdogs who call the government to account.
European leaders criticized the bill and have since frozen Georgia’s accession process, just months after it was offered EU candidate status.
Georgian Dream officials still maintain it remains committed to joining the EU. Nicoloz Samkharadze, chair of the country’s foreign relations committee, told CNN the “foreign agent” law “does not contradict any European norm.” He claimed it had no effect on Georgia’s progress toward the EU.
Zourabichvili disagreed. “The Europeans have clearly said to the Georgian authorities … that you cannot pretend that you will join the EU (while) doing what you are doing,” she said.
During the election campaign, Ivanishvili – who made his fortune in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union – threatened to imprison his political rivals and ban the main opposition party, the United National Movement (UNM), if Georgian Dream won another term.
The UNM was founded by former President Mikheil Saakashvili, who has been jailed since 2021 for abuse of power while in office.
Asked if she feared similar political retribution, Zourabichvili said she is more worried about the fate of Georgia and what will happen “if things are in the hands of the Georgian Dream.”
“My personal future in that is not as important as the future of Georgia,” she said.",['Christian Edwards'],en

Recognizing them would be tantamount to legitimizing Russia’s takeover of Georgia … We cannot surrender our European future for the sake of future generations.”
The government, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, she said, is “illegitimate” and the election it carried out October 26 was a “complete falsification.”
Her voice rising, she said: “We were not just witnesses but also victims of what can only be described as a Russian special operation – a new form of hybrid warfare waged against our people and our country.”
She urged Georgians to gather in protest Monday evening on the capital’s main street, Rustaveli Avenue, “to peacefully defend every vote and, most importantly, our future.”
The statement was a bold challenge to the Georgian Dream’s founder and now honorary chairman, the reclusive billionaire oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, who claimed victory in the parliamentary election even before all the votes were counted.
Ivanishvili had vowed to ban the opposition if his party won the election, and his opponents are taking him at his word.
Many Georgians feel deep hostility toward Russia, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory – about the same proportion it occupies in Ukraine. Despite recent Russian aggression against Georgia, Georgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies and Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union.
On Saturday, as Georgians cast their ballots, thousands of Georgian and international election observers fanned out to voting precincts across the country, from urban centers to poor, remote villages in the Caucasus mountains, trying to evaluate whether the vote was free and fair.
Throughout election day, video of violations, some of them egregious, like a man boldly jamming ballots into a ballot box, spread quickly.
The day after, at a briefing by the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, the conclusions were troubling: “systematic” intimidation; harassment of voters inside and outside polling stations; “pervasive intimidation and pressure on public sector employees and social-service benefits recipients.”
Observations by the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy (ISFED) were even more stark: “On election day, ISFED documented serious violations, such as ballot stuffing of ballot papers, multiple voting, unprecedented levels of voter bribery, expulsion of observers from polling stations, as well as instances of mobilizing voters outside polling stations, collecting their personal data, and controlling their voting intentions.”
In Tbilisi, former US Representative John Shimkus said the intimidation and harassment of voters created an “atmosphere of fear.”
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also acknowledged the election observers’ “reports of irregularities and sporadic violence.”
“We condemn all contraventions of international norms and join calls from international and local observers for a full investigation of all reports of election-related violations,” Blinken said, urging Georgia’s political leaders to “address deficiencies in the electoral process together.”
Swedish Member of Parliament Margareta Cederfelt added: “The government’s continued harassment and intimidation of voters and civil society not only during the election period, but well before it, has threatened Georgia’s democratic underpinnings.”
The Georgian opposition owes its new unity to the efforts of President Zourabichvili, a person some of them used to criticize, but now respect.
“She is on the right side of history,” said opposition politician Nika Gvaramia. “She is the only one who can unite people.”
Speaking at his Ahali party headquarters, part of the “Coalition 4 Change” just off Tbilisi’s main street, Gvaramia, along with Elene Khoshtaria, founder of the “Droa” party, told reporters: “Russia hacked the (Georgian) election.”
Moscow, they claimed, is carrying out a “hybrid war” with new and different means of technical meddling, and it’s right out of “Putin’s playbook.”
The West, they said, isn’t even playing catch up.
Meanwhile, the Georgian government announced that its first high-level visitor after the election will be Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who plans to spend October 28 and 29 in a high-profile show of support to the Georgian Dream government.
The illiberal leader has found common cause with Georgia’s ruling party and was the first international leader to congratulate them after the election – even before the votes were officially tallied.

The Georgian Dream (GD) party, founded by the reclusive billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, secured just under 54% of the vote, according to near-complete data from the Central Election Commission (CEC).
The main opposition parties, the Coalition for Change and the United National Movement (UNM) – founded by the jailed former president Mikheil Saakashvili – received 11% and 10% of the vote, respectively. Both have disputed the results and called for protests.
If confirmed, GD’s reelection could halt Georgia’s progress toward eventual membership of the European Union and see the former Soviet state slip back into the Kremlin’s orbit.
Ivanishvili, claimed victory swiftly after polls closed on Saturday. “It is a rare case in the world that the same party achieves such success in such a difficult situation,” he said outside the GD headquarters in Tbilisi.
Georgia’s splintered opposition parties have cried foul. “The elections were stolen, this is a coup and the GD is responsible for it and they will be held accountable,” Nika Gvamaria, one of the leaders of the Coalition for Change, said late Saturday.
Tina Bokuchava, head of the UNM, said her party does not accept the “falsified” election results. She said GD was attempting to “steal the European future of this country.”
Before the vote, observers had warned that GD – which came to power in 2012 as a center-left party but has in recent years taken a sharp authoritarian turn – would resort to anything to stay in power.
The election was marred by scenes of violence and disorder at polling stations across the country. A spokesperson for the CEC told CNN it has received 445 district-level complaints of irregularities.
President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-Western figure whose powers are largely ceremonial, said groups had descended on polling stations “with the sole purpose of provoking conflict and confrontation.”
In one video from the southern city of Marneuli, a man was seen stuffing dozens of voting cards into a ballot box. Another video showed Azad Karimov – head of the opposition UNM’s regional organization – being assaulted by several men outside the polling station.
Levan Khabeishvili, who stood down as head of the UNM earlier this year after being assaulted by police during anti-government protests, said the opposition “could not believe” the results published by the CEC, since polls before the election showed only around a third of the public supported GD.
“There is not a single institution in Georgia that is not directly controlled by Bidzina Ivanishvili at this point,” Khabeishvili told CNN.
Official election observers have also expressed concerns about Saturday’s vote. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), a monitoring group, said its election observers had noted “cases of vote buying and double voting, before and during elections, especially in rural areas.”
Speaking at a press conference in Tbilisi on Sunday, Iulian Bulai, the head of PACE’s delegation in Georgia, said the use of cameras in many polling stations “led to a widespread climate of pressure and party-organized intimidation and the feeling that Big Brother is watching you.”
The first exit polls showed vastly different results. A poll conducted by Edison Research showed GD receiving 40.9% of the vote, while a poll by the pro-government Imedi TV station showed GD had won 56%.
Before the CEC published preliminary results, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban congratulated GD on its “overwhelming victory.” Critics have alleged that GD has increasingly modeled itself on Orban, Europe’s longest-serving leader. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest this year, Georgia’s Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze praised Orban as a “role model.”
Fragmented opposition
Polls routinely show that more than 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union. Although Georgia was given candidate status in 2023, Brussels froze its application process earlier this year after GD passed a divisive “foreign agents” law that critics say is modeled on similar legislation passed by Russian President Vladimir Putin designed to shut down watchdogs who call the government to account.
Although GD officially remains committed to eventual EU membership, its increasingly autocratic streak has isolated the Caucasus nation from its Western allies and pushed it closer towards illiberal regimes like Russia.
GD had campaigned on keeping Georgia out of the war in Ukraine. Before the vote, campaign billboards had contrasted thriving Georgian cities with Ukrainian ones reduced to rubble.
Ketevan Chachava, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said this message, aiming to stoke “fear,” had been particularly effective in rural areas. “GD won in the regions; they lost the big cities,” she told CNN.
During the campaign, Ivanishvili had claimed the opposition belonged to a “Global War Party” bent on dragging Georgia into conflict with Russia, and has threatened to arrest his rivals and outlaw the UNM if his party is reelected.
The response to the exit polls has so far been muted. Although hundreds of thousands of Georgians had protested against the foreign agents bill earlier this year, the streets of Tbilisi were relatively quiet on Saturday.",['Christian Edwards'],en

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Mechnikov Hospital in the south-central city of Dnipro one of the country’s “most important.” Before the war it treated up to 40,000 patients a year.
Five people, including a child, were killed in the strikes overnight, said Serhii Lysak, head of the Dnipro regional military administration, posting on his official Telegram.
The strike comes just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin faced calls from world leaders attending the BRICs summit in Kazan, Russia to end the war in Ukraine.
Zelensky made a pointed reference to this week’s summit in his statement posted on social media, saying that “after everything said in Kazan, Russian murderers have resumed their usual business.”
“This proves once again that aggression cannot be stopped by words alone but only by decisive action in defense of the state and the people against whom this war is waged,” the Ukrainian leader added.
At least 21 people were injured in the attack on Dnipro including a 17-year-old boy who is in a “serious condition,” according to Lysak.
“As a result of the overnight missile attack, there is damage in several locations in the city,” Lysak said, adding that one apartment building had been destroyed and two dozen others damaged by the strike.
Photos shared by Lysak showed rescuers working through huge piles of rubble and the inside of what looked to be a hospital room with blown out windows.
The city’s mayor, Borys Filatov described a sleepless night he spent as missiles descended upon the city.
“This is not just a two-story building;. This is an ordinary residential building with eight apartments hit with a ballistic missile,” Filatov added.
Dnipro was not the only major Ukrainian city hit overnight. The capital, Kyiv also experienced a drone attack, according to the head of the military administration, Serhii Popko.
A young girl was killed after her apartment building in the Solomianskyi district was struck, Popko said. A woman in her 50s was also killed by strikes in the Kyiv region, according to the regional military administration.
More than 100 people were evacuated from the same residential building in the city after what Popko said was the sixteenth air attack on Kyiv this month alone.
The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia used a combination of “various types of missiles, Shahed-type attack UAVs, and drones of unspecified type” to carry out attacks across the country.
Ukrainian air defenses succeeded in shooting down 44 out of 91 Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the Air Force said on Telegram. Three Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles launched by Crimea were also detected, according to the air force.","['Niamh Kennedy', 'Maria Kostenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/25/europe/georgia-election-russia-europe-intl/index.html,"As Georgia votes, fears of a return to Moscow’s orbit loom large",2024-10-25 08:30:38,"At the Joseph Stalin Museum in Gori, the small Georgian town where the Soviet dictator was born, a line of guides is waiting to tell you the story of the local boy who made it big.
They can list the birthdays of Stalin’s family and recite the poems he wrote as a schoolboy (for Stalin “could have been a poet, but chose to be a great leader”). But on other things, they are less exact. Of the millions killed in the gulag, “mistakes were made.” Of show trials, they have little to say.
So revered is Stalin by some that when the government thought it time to remove his towering statue in 2010, they did so unannounced at night, lest locals protest. But while some older voters in rural towns like Gori might harbor fond memories of life under communism and pine for a Soviet past, they seemed set to be swept away by younger generations who have grown up knowing nothing but democracy, and who are happy to see Stalin consigned to history’s dustbin.
Now, as voters in the Caucasus nation cast their ballots in Saturday’s parliamentary election, the specter of authoritarianism looms large once again.
Many observers fear the ruling Georgian Dream party will resort to anything to stay in power. It has buried the liberal values it espoused when it took office 12 years ago and effectively torpedoed Georgia’s bid to join the European Union. Its founder, the secretive oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has threatened to imprison his political rivals after the election and ban the main opposition party.
After spending years in the shadows, Ivanishvili – who made his billions in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union and served as Georgia’s prime minister from 2012 to 2013 – returned late last year as the party’s honorary chairman and has since given a string of conspiracy-tinged speeches. He claims Georgia is being controlled by a foreign “pseudo-elite” and that the opposition belongs to a “Global War Party” bent on dragging the country into conflict with Russia. This year, Georgian Dream pushed through a Kremlin-style “foreign agent” law, which critics say aims to shut down watchdogs who call the government to account.
For many, Ivanishvili’s rhetoric is eerily reminiscent of the past from which many Georgians are keen to escape. And the anti-Western posturing of Georgian Dream, along with the country’s controversial foreign agent law, directly mirrors President Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on domestic political opposition in neighboring Russia.
“It’s incredible how much of this old Bolshevik, Stalinist language is back. Everybody’s a traitor, everybody’s a foreign agent,” Natalie Sabanadze, a fellow at the London think-tank Chatham House and former Georgian ambassador to the EU, told CNN. She described some of the statements made by Georgian Dream officials as a “copy-paste” of those from Stalin’s show trials. “Have people forgotten what it was like?” Sabanadze asks.
In a speech last month in Gori, Ivanishvili also broke a taboo in Georgian society. He said Georgia should apologize for the 2008 war with Russia, for which many Georgians blame Moscow. Russia fought the five-day war in support of pro-Kremlin separatists in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, just north of Gori. Combined with Abkhazia, another breakaway region, Russia today de facto occupies 20% of Georgia’s territory.
Ivanishvili said apologizing to Russia would help preserve “12 years of uninterrupted peace” the country has enjoyed under Georgian Dream’s leadership, which he warned the opposition could jeopardize. The message has some appeal to his rural base but sparked a political firestorm.
Mikheil Saakashvili, who was Georgia’s president during the war but has been imprisoned since 2021 for abuse of power while in office, called the comments a “betrayal.”
Younger, more pro-European Georgians were also outraged. Their earliest memories are not of easier lives under communism, but of Russian tanks rolling into Gori and towards the capital, Tbilisi. Walking out of the Stalin Museum – past his personal railway carriage, past the hut in which he was born – it is easy to find buildings still scarred with bullet holes from the 2008 war. Many buildings still lie in ruins, while Stalin Avenue has been kept pristine.
For these Georgians, Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 rekindled memories of Russian aggression in their own country. They want nothing more than for Georgia to slip from the Kremlin’s orbit and continue its march toward a European future.
But many fear the government is now heading in the opposite direction, and that Georgia could be on the cusp of returning to the one-party rule from which it escaped a generation ago.
“The election will be crucial,” Davit Mzhavanadze, a researcher at the Governance Monitoring Center in Tbilisi, told CNN. “If this government keeps power, Georgia will become more Belarusian than European.”
At a press conference in Tbilisi on Thursday, Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili – a pro-Western but largely ceremonial figure who has urged Georgians to vote against the government – said she “rules out any outcome other than a victory for the pro-European forces,” citing polls which routinely show that only around a third of the public support Georgian Dream.
‘Soviet mentality’
A question puzzling many is why the formerly center-left Georgian Dream has made a sudden authoritarian pivot.
The party’s origin was unusual. It takes its name from a rap song by Ivanishvili’s son, Bera. Although some suspected Ivanishvili – whose net worth is equivalent to about a quarter of the country’s GDP – might pursue a pro-Russian path, during his brief premiership he tacked close to Europe and even promised eventual NATO membership.
“A modern civil society has been a cherished goal of the Georgian people since we regained our independence 20 years ago,” Ivanishvili wrote in an email to then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012, subsequently leaked. “Unfortunately, old habits are hard to overcome.”
That has proved true for his own government, Sabanadze of Chatham House told CNN. Her career is a measure of Georgian Dream’s ideological shifts. As recently as 2021, Sabanadze served as Georgia’s ambassador to the EU. Now, she says she’s troubled by the party’s shift to the right.
Having abandoned its liberal origins, Sabanadze said, the party is now “clearly copying” the model of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest this year, Georgia’s Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze praised Orban as a “role model,” parroting his claims to defend “homeland, language and faith.” The government has also passed legislation curbing LGBTQ+ rights.
But now it is poised to go much further. Ivanishvili has promised a “Nuremberg trial” against members of the opposition, who have been subject to increasing persecution. During street protests in Tbilisi against the foreign agent law, Levan Khabeishvili – chair of the pro-Western United National Movement (UNM) – said he was brutally beaten by police. He appeared the next day in parliament, his face blackened and swollen.
Khabeishvili has since stepped down as chairman, citing the effect the beating had on his health. He said the assault was meant to intimidate Georgia’s opposition. “Ivanishvili has a Soviet mentality. He’s a Soviet guy,” he told CNN.
The Georgian government did not respond to a request for comment.
Preparing for the worst
A consequence of Russia’s war in Ukraine was the EU’s decision to offer Georgia candidate status. Brussels, keen to stem Russia’s influence in former Soviet countries, put Georgia – along with Ukraine and Moldova – on an accelerated path to membership.
Many say this was despite Georgian Dream, rather than because of it. During protests against the “foreign agent” law, the images of citizens waving EU flags being buffeted back by water cannons put pressure on Brussels to reward the Georgian people, of whom more than 80% support EU membership, polls show.
Whether Ivanishvili wanted candidate status is not clear. Joining the EU would require cleaning up the country’s judiciary and giving up power if Georgian Dream is voted out on Saturday. His opponents doubt he is willing to do this.
Under the country’s new proportional voting system, Khabeishvili of the UNM says Georgia’s fragmented opposition will have no trouble forming a coalition after the election. But he fears that Ivanishvili will seek to cling to power after an election loss.
If this happens, he predicts huge protests in Tbilisi and throughout the country. Here, things could get ugly. Sergei Naryshkin, director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, said in August that Georgia’s Western allies are plotting a coup to remove Georgian Dream from power. He warned Russia will be on standby to prevent this.
For Sabanadze, the stakes could not be higher: How Georgians vote on Saturday, and how the government responds, will determine whether the country remains on a path to Europe or becomes more like Belarus.
“When I was in Brussels, I thought that Georgia would never become an authoritarian state again, because it’s just something that we find very difficult to accept,” she said. “Georgians will put up a fight. The Belarus scenario will not happen easily.”",['Christian Edwards'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/asia/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,Are North Koreans fighting in Ukraine? Here’s what we know,2024-10-23 07:29:48,"There is growing intelligence that North Korea has been readying itself for a more direct role in Russia’s war in Ukraine, a move that could reverberate far beyond the frontlines of the war raging in Europe.
The United States, Ukraine and South Korea say that North Korean troops were dispatched to Russia for training with the aim of being deployed to Ukraine.
Russia and North Korea have dismissed the reports, although on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country.
South Korea has hinted that any deployment could cause it to reassess what level of military support it gives Ukraine.
A group of North Korean soldiers has been spotted in Russia’s Kursk region, an area that borders Ukraine and has seen ongoing military operations, Ukraine’s military intelligence service announced Thursday.
Leaked audio intercepts obtained by the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and released on Friday revealed Russian soldiers raising concerns about how North Korean soldiers will be commanded and provided with ammunition and military kit, further heightening fears around Pyongyang’s involvement.
In recent months, Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened their anti-US military partnership and the growing alliance has concerned officials in Kyiv and Washington.
Here’s what we know.
Are North Koreans in Ukraine?
On Wednesday, the White House said at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers had arrived in eastern Russia this month and while it remains unclear what they will do, it is a “highly concerning probability” that they will join the fight against Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly warned that North Korean troops are joining Russia’s war, telling a NATO summit last week that “10,000” soldiers and technical personnel were being prepared.
Zelensky said Friday that according to Ukraine’s intelligence, Russia will deploy its first North Korean troops in combat zones on October 27 and 28, adding, “This is a clear step in Russia’s escalation that matters.”
Meanwhile, South Korea’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), said last week that North Korea had shipped 1,500 soldiers, including special forces fighters, to Russia for training.
Those reports appeared to be bolstered when North Korean soldiers were filmed receiving uniforms and equipment at a training ground in Russia’s Far East. Another video circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN showed troops arriving at the Sergeevka Training Ground close to Russia’s border with China.
What is Ukrainian intelligence saying?
The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine said Thursday that some North Korean troops, who had received training in Russia’s far east, have made their way to the Kursk region in western Russia, where Ukraine has maintained a foothold since launching a surprise incursion in August.
Russian soldiers have been heard raising concerns about how North Korean soldiers will be commanded and provided with ammunition and military kit, leaked intercepts obtained by the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and released on Friday show.
The Russian soldiers talk disdainfully about the incoming North Korean soldiers, codenamed the “K Battalion,” at one point referring to them as “the f**king Chinese.”
In the same extra ct, a serviceman describes another who has been tasked to “meet people.”
“And he’s like standing there with his eyes out, like… f**k,” the soldier says. “He came here and says what the f**k to do with them.”
The audio was intercepted from encrypted Russian transmission channels on the night of October 23, according to Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence.
Ukraine’s analysis of the intercepts revealed that North Korean troop movements were planned for the morning of October 24, in the area of Postoyalye Dvory field camp in the Kursk region.
The intercepts also reveal plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean men, which the Russian soldiers are heard in the audio condemning.
“The only thing I don’t understand is that there [should be] three senior officers for 30 people. Where do we get them? We’ll have to pull them out,” one Russian serviceman says.
What’s North Korea’s relationship with Russia?
Russia and North Korea, both pariahs in the West, have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow’s invasion.
In June, the two nations signed a landmark defense pact and pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its grinding war in Ukraine, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers.
The arms shipments, which include thousands of metric tons of munitions, have helped Russia replenish its dwindling stockpiles in a war where Ukraine’s forces have long been outgunned and outmanned. Meanwhile, cash-strapped North Korea is believed to have received food and other necessities in exchange.
The hermit nation also seeks to advance its space, missile and illegal nuclear programs.
What has the reaction been?
The Kremlin had initially dismissed allegations of North Korean troop deployments, but on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously dismissed the allegations that North Korean personnel had been sent to help Russia as “another hoax.” When asked directly by reporters on Monday whether Moscow was sending North Korean troops to fight in Ukraine, Peskov said that North Korea is a “close neighbor” and the two states were “developing relations in all areas.”
“This cooperation is not directed against third countries,” he said.
North Korea called the claims “groundless, stereotyped rumors,” during a UN General Assembly meeting Monday.
But Seoul is not taking this lightly.
On Monday, its Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador and urged an “immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops.”
South Korean First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Hong-kyun warned the alleged deployment violates UN Security Council resolutions. The National Security Office held an emergency meeting to discuss a possible South Korean response.
Following the meeting, Kim Tae-hyo, the first deputy director of national security, said the government would implement “phased countermeasures” according to the “progress of the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.”
It is unclear what the measures would be, but a South Korean government official said that they are preparing “diplomatic, economic and military measures.”
As North Korea is in the “preliminary stage of deploying troops to Russia,” South Korea is assessing whether it will proceed to “actual combat participation,” the government official added.
“We are developing scenarios to understand the potential impacts North Korea and Russia’s actions could have on us,” the government official said.
Seoul, one of the world’s largest arms suppliers, has provided humanitarian aid and financial support to Ukraine, while joining Western sanctions against Moscow. But it has has not directly provided lethal weapons to Kyiv due to arms export controls to countries at war.
The stakes are high.
North and South Korea are separated by one of the world’s most militarized borders and remain technically in a state of war. Relations between the two have deteriorated in recent years with an uptick in fiery rhetoric on both sides of the demilitarized zone.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Wednesday the US does not believe the North Korean troops have reached Ukraine, but the movements have generated deep concern as a potentially serious escalation. “It will have impacts not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well,” Austin said.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said if the troops are deployed to Ukraine, “They’re fair game. They’re fair targets.”
What’s the significance?
Any intervention by North Korea could be a watershed moment. The isolated and heavily sanctioned regime taking a role in a major international conflict on the other side of the world is something it has not done in decades.
The state has one of the largest militaries in the world, with 1.2 million soldiers, but many of its troops lack combat experience.
Analysts say the North Korean regime would have a lot to gain from deploying troops, including giving its forces battlefield experience and technical training. The arrangement could also help North Korea gain real-world intelligence on the functioning of its weaponry.
“The special forces troops will come back with live battlefield experience, live infiltration experience against an alerted combat opponent. That makes them more dangerous,” said Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.
“I think Kim is providing the troops to gain the resources he needs to sustain the regime, and lessons learned that he might apply if he thinks the conflict is coming in the peninsula,” he added.
Chun In-bum, a former lieutenant general in the South Korean army, told CNN that the Russians would “get a boost in manpower, which they lack right now” and the North Koreans will get “money, technology” and experience.
Those deployed would be special “elite” forces rather than conventional troops, analysts say.
“If they succeed there, they will get not only firsthand battle experience, but international recognition. So, this could be a real serious problem for the entire world,” Chun said.
“What if the North Koreans make this a habit? What if they become a base for supplying well-trained soldiers? The potential of this deployment should be very concerning.”

In a post on its official Telegram account, the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine said some North Korean troops, who had received training in Russia’s far east, have made their way to the western Russia region, where Ukraine has maintained a foothold since launching an incursion in August.
The intelligence service said the troops had been seen in Kursk on Wednesday. It added that the roughly 12,000 North Korean soldiers that have been deployed to Russia are receiving training at five military training grounds in the country’s east.
The Kremlin had initially dismissed allegations of North Korean troop deployments, but on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country.
Last week, CNN geolocated social media videos showing troops arriving at the Sergeevka training ground, close to Russia’s border with China.
Thursday’s 12,000 figure is larger than had been previously been flagged by US officials. On Wednesday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers arrived in eastern Russia this month.
Ukrainian intelligence services said Thursday that “several weeks” have been allocated for the coordination of the North Korean troops which includes 500 officers and three generals.
Ukraine had repeatedly warned that warming relations between Russia and North Korea could see Pyongyang take a more direct role in the war in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that Kyiv had intelligence about Russia “training two military units from North Korea” involving perhaps “two brigades of 6,000 people each.” He added that Ukraine has seen North Korean “officers and technical staff in the temporarily occupied territories” and believes Russia is “preparing a grouping” to enter Ukraine.
The issue has raised alarm bells among Ukraine’s allies. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called it a “major escalation in the war” during a Thursday interview with CNN’s Isa Soares. “It’s no longer regional, it’s no longer just European – it is a global conflict, and it affects everybody,” Landsbergis said.
Russia’s president did not deny the presence of the North Korean troops when pressed on the issue on Thursday.
When asked by journalists about reports that North Korea was sending troops to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, Putin said his country is “in contact” with Pyongyang.
“We have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously,” he told a press conference in Kazan, Russia. “But what and how we will do is our business.”
Russia and North Korea, both pariahs in the West, have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/us-g7-ukraine-loan-package/index.html,"US and G7 allies moving forward with $50 billion loan package to Ukraine, including $20 billion from the US backed by frozen Russian assets",2024-10-17 00:00:00,"The US and Western allies are moving forward with a $50 billion loan package to Ukraine backed by the profits of frozen Russian assets, which includes a US contribution of $20 billion, the White House announced Wednesday.
“As part of the G7 package, the United States is announcing today that we will provide $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back by the interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets,” President Joe Biden said in a statement formally announcing the package. “In other words, Ukraine can receive the assistance it needs now, without burdening taxpayers.”
The president described the loans as supporting Ukrainians “as they defend and rebuild their country.”
“And our efforts make it clear,” Biden added, “tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause.”
Biden administration officials view the aid as vital for Kyiv’s war-torn economy heading into the winter months.
“Ukraine will receive the assistance it needs now, without burdening our taxpayers,” said White House deputy national security advisor for international economics Daleep Singh.
The announcement comes during a fraught political period in the US, which is less than two weeks away from a presidential election that could return Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has been a public skeptic of US aid to Ukraine, to the White House.
The US will disperse at least half of its $20 billion loan by this December, according to Singh. The administration plans to use half of the loan for economic assistance and the second half for additional military aid to Kyiv. But the White House will need to secure further authority from Congress to provide parts of the loan as military support.
If the White House cannot reach an agreement with the legislative branch securing the requisite authorities, Singh said that the administration would pivot and instead provide the full loan amount as economic aid.
“We’re going to provide $20 billion either way. But we’ll work with Congress over the next few months to assess whether we can get sufficient authority through foreign military financing, loan guarantee authorities to provide half of our assistance through military support,” Singh said.
The other $30 billion in aid will come from the European Union and fellow G7 partners, including the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.
“As we committed in June, the G7 will begin dispersing assistance for the benefit of Ukraine by the end of this year, so that we can meet Ukraine’s urgent needs as we approach the winter while sending an unmistakable signal, the United States and its G7 partners will not fatigue,” Singh said.
The US-led campaign to reach an agreement between the other G7 nations — the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — was announced at the group’s summit in Puglia, Italy, earlier this year.
In the ensuing months, the US and its allies have ironed out the finer details of executing the complex loan. European lawmakers on Tuesday approved a loan of up roughly $37.7 billion (35 billion euros) for Ukraine backed by the frozen Russian assets.
Further details will be announced following the forthcoming G7 finance ministers meeting, he added.
Western nations froze Russia’s assets in bank accounts located within Europe and the US as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Hundreds of billions of assets are frozen in Europe, with just a small amount – roughly $3 billion – located in banks in the US.
This originally led European officials to raise concerns they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, but negotiators have ultimately structured the deal so all countries participating share the risk.
Should a peace agreement be reached in the conflict, either the Russian assets will stay frozen and generate interest to repay the loans until they’re repaid, or Russia will pay for the damage it has caused.
G7 countries first started thinking of other long-term sources of funding for Ukraine late last year amid doubts on the future political and financial commitment to continue spending taxpayer money in Ukraine.

“We assess that between early- to mid-October, North Korea moved at least 3,000 soldiers into eastern Russia,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. “We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia. … We do not yet know whether these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability. After completing training, these soldiers could travel to western Russia and then engage in combat against the Ukrainian military.”
Earlier Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was the first senior US official to confirm on the record that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia as North Korea and Russia have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
“We are seeing evidence that that there are North Korean troops that have gone to Russia,” Austin told reporters traveling with him in Rome on Wednesday. “What, exactly, they’re doing is left to be seen.”
The US does not believe the North Korean troops have reached Ukraine, but the movements have generated deep concern as a potentially serious escalation in the conflict. Austin said the US is still trying to determine what role the North Koreans will play and whether they intend to travel to Ukraine.
“If they’re a co-belligerent, their intention is to participate in this war on Russia’s behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only on in Europe — It will also impact things in the Indo Pacific as well,” Austin said.
Kirby said Wednesday that the US has briefed the Ukrainian government and are keeping in close consultation with allies and partners.
A senior administration official said earlier Wednesday that the training of North Korean soldiers and possible preparation to send them to find to Ukraine is a sign of serious desperation on Russia’s part.
In Rome, Austin said Putin “may be even in more trouble than most people realize.” Kirby added that turning to North Korea for manpower “would be a sign of weakness, not strength, on the part of the Kremlin.” Kirby also said the move is a violation of UN Security Council Resolutions.
Asked what North Korea will get in return for helping Russia with manpower, Austin said the US is still trying to determine that as well.
In recent months, Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened their anti-United States military partnership and the growing alliance has concerned officials in Kyiv and Washington.
“I can tell you one thing, though,” Kirby said Wednesday. “If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they’re fair game. They’re fair targets.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/europe/putin-russia-iran-china-brics-hnk-intl/index.html,The West wants Putin isolated. A major summit he’s hosting shows he’s far from alone,2024-10-21 23:54:38,"Nearly three years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw Moscow condemned by countries globally, leader Vladimir Putin is staging a summit with more than a dozen world leaders – in a pointed signal from the autocrat that far from being alone, an emerging coalition of countries stands behind him.
The three-day BRICS summit, which started Tuesday in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan, is the first meeting of the group of major emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa since it expanded earlier this year to include Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Iran.
Putin met with China’s Xi Jinping at the summit on Tuesday, and claimed afterwards that their countries’ partnership was a “model of how relations between states should be built.”
Other leaders attending include India’s Narendra Modi, Iran’s Masoud Pezeshkian, South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa. Some from outside the club, like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are also expected to join. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva canceled plans to attend after suffering an injury at home.
Set to be by far the largest international gathering the Russian president has hosted since the start of the war in February 2022, the gathering of BRICS and other countries this week spotlights a growing convergence of nations who hope to see a shift in the global balance of power and – in the case of some, like Moscow, Beijing and Tehran – directly counter the United States-led West.
It’s this latter message that Putin – and close partner and most powerful BRICS country leader Xi – will project in the coming days: it’s the West that stands isolated in the world with its sanctions and alliances, while a “global majority” of countries support their bid to challenge American global leadership.
In remarks to reporters Friday, Putin hailed the growing economic and political clout of BRICS countries as an “undeniable fact” and said that if BRICS and interested countries work together, they “will be a substantial element of the new world order” – though he denied the group was an “anti-Western alliance.”
Putin’s messaging this week will be all the more poignant as the meeting comes just days ahead of the US elections, where a potential victory for former President Donald Trump could see the US shift its staunch support of Ukraine and strain Washington’s ties with its traditional allies more broadly.
“This BRICS summit is really a gift (for Putin),” said Alex Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin. “The message will be: how can you talk about Russia’s global isolation when (all these) leaders … are coming to Kazan.”
Russia wants to portray BRICS “as the spearhead, the new organization that leads us all as a global community to a more just order,” Gabuev said.
But despite Russia’s sweeping rhetoric, the leaders meeting in Kazan have a wide range of viewpoints and interests – a reality of BRICS that observers say limits their ability to send a unified message – especially the kind Putin may desire.
Global crises
The Russian-hosted gathering poses a sharp contrast to last year’s BRICS summit in Johannesburg, when Putin participated from the other side of a video screen – unable to attend in person due to an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes over Ukraine.
This year, the Russian president is at the helm of the first summit since the organization nearly doubled in size – and the gathering is playing out before a very different global landscape.
While BRICS is primarily geared toward economic collaboration, its meeting last year took place in the shadow of the war in Ukraine. Now, even as that war rages on, the expanding conflict in the Middle East, where Israel is fighting Iran’s proxies, is also likely to dominate leaders’ conversations.
Putin last week confirmed that Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas would join the event. The Russian leader and his officials will likely use the conflict – and the anger across the Global South toward the US and its support for Israel – to press his argument for a new world order without the US at the helm, observers say.
China and Russia have both called for a ceasefire in the spiraling conflict and criticized Israel’s actions, while the US has endorsed Israel’s right to retaliate against militant groups Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Many attending the summit see the conflict in the Middle East “as a prime example of why this particular grouping of countries should have more influence,” said Jonathan Fulton, an Abu Dhabi-based senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council. However, he said, countries are “using it mostly as a rhetorical point to criticize things they don’t like,” rather than showing interest in leading its resolution.
Observers will also be watching whether China and Brazil use the gathering as a platform to play up their joint six-point peace proposal on the war in Ukraine, as they did at last month’s meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Then, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky slammed the effort, saying such plans would help Moscow, while warning Beijing and Brasilia: “you will not boost your power at Ukraine’s expense.”
Zelensky’s own challenges presenting his “victory plan” to end the war and the impending US elections mean China now has “a tremendous opportunity to beat the drum of its own format (on Ukraine) without sparing too much leverage,” according to Gabuev in Berlin.
The gathering in Kazan also gives Putin ample opportunity for one-on-one facetime with his fellow BRICS leaders and other friendly dignitaries in attendance.
The recent inclusion in BRICS of Iran – which CNN has reported has provided Russia with hundreds of drones, as well as short-range ballistic missiles (a transfer Iran denies) – brings a close Russian partner even further into Moscow’s fold. China has also been accused by the US and its allies of powering Russia’s war effort through its provision of dual-used goods like machine tools and microelectronics – a role Beijing also denies as it defends its “normal trade” with Russia and “neutrality” on the war.
Identity crisis
Leaders over the next few days are expected to discuss how to advance on-going efforts to settle payments outside the US dollar-denominated system using BRICS currencies and banking networks, a system that could have economic benefits, but also helps member countries like Russia circumnavigate Western sanctions. The countries are also likely to look for ways to boost economic, technological and financial cooperation across a range of areas from energy to sharing satellite data.
At the same time, however, they’ll be grappling with the divisions and differing agendas between countries within the group, which observers say limit how much BRICS can achieve.
That’s nothing new for the group, which held its first summit of Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009 as a convergence of key emerging markets before expanding the following year to include South Africa. In 2015, BRICS launched its New Development Bank, seen as an alternative or supplement to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Loosely united by a shared interest in reforming the international system to ensure their voices were better represented, BRICS from its start has incorporated countries with deep differences in political and economic systems – as well as other frictions.
India and China, for example, have a long-simmering border conflict, but make up two key pillars of the club. Their divisions have become even more prominent in recent years as China-US have become increasingly fraught, while India and the US have become closer partners.
Today, even as BRICS has again expanded – and the Kremlin says more than 30 additional countries are interested in joining or cooperating with it – deepening geopolitical fault lines further complicate BRICS’ identity and direction, observers say.
“(China and Russia have) essentially tried to shift the group from the sense of (BRICS) being emerging economies to potentially being some sort of an expression of angst with regard to Western dominance,” said Manoj Kewalramani, who heads Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution research center in the Indian city of Bangalore.
And new or aspiring members may not be wanting to choose between this vision or the West. Instead, they are looking to grow their economies and “engage non-ideologically and pragmatically,” he said.

Drone attacks on ordinary people living here have sharply increased since the beginning of fall, with residents reporting Russian drone attacks on pedestrians, cars, buses and even an ambulance, according to local officials.
And the injury reports suggest that drones are targeting civilians – in some cases hitting elderly people and children.
Last week, a 76-year-old woman suffered serious injuries when her car was hit in an urban, residential district in the center of Kherson, according to the local military administration. In another October attack on the outskirts of the city, in the suburb of Antonivka, officials said a 69-year-old woman was killed when a drone dropped explosives on a public bus.
Authorities said at least 14 people have been killed by drones since the beginning of September, with a further 222 adults and three children injured.
“They don’t care who they shoot at. Grandma, grandpa, it doesn’t matter. Man, woman, it doesn’t matter,” said Tetyana Yakovleva, 47, a factory worker and humanitarian volunteer from the Antonivka suburb. Locals have nicknamed the street leading there “the road of death,” as it’s in close range of nearby Russian forces and was once a focal point of the fighting.
Kherson is the largest Ukrainian city to sit on the front line and was the first major city to fall under Russian occupation, in early March 2022, remaining in enemy hands until it was liberated eight months later. In June last year, parts of the city were flooded when the Nova Kakhovka dam, 36 miles up the Dnipro river in Russian-held territory, was destroyed. Today, the threat of occupation still looms just across the river, where Russian military positions are literally within sight.
Yakovleva stayed in her village during the occupation and has been injured multiple times since the start of the war, including by shrapnel. Most recently, a drone attacked a shelter where she was volunteering, helping to provide humanitarian aid to civilians.
“The drone hovered over us, hovered for a long time. And then it dropped a grenade next to the door,” Yakovleva told CNN. “We were all shell-shocked.”
“It’s really scary… We look at the sky before we go out. We make sure there’s no buzzing,” she added. “Bad weather now is luck for us.”
Two Ukrainian Armed Forces sources operating in the Kherson region couldn’t give CNN any military reasoning behind the Russian drone strikes. “It’s just to terrorize the locals,” one of the military sources said.
Russia attacked the area with more than 2,700 drones in September and had already launched 1,500 this month by October 17, according to the head of the Kherson region’s military administration, Oleksandr Prokudin.
Difficult to combat
The frequency of the attacks and the drones’ small size make them difficult for Ukrainian forces to thwart. The drones also move at high speed, making it nearly impossible for civilians to escape if they are in the crosshairs.
“A lot of these drones operate on wavelengths and at altitudes way below air defense systems. They’re too small as well,” said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank. She said the “sheer mass” of Russian drones – many of which are small, commercially available units that are easy to deploy – is putting tremendous pressure on Ukrainian detection systems.
ISW found that drone strikes on the Kherson region notably increased around mid-July 2024. That coincides with when Ukrainian forces began to withdraw from positions on the Russian-occupied eastern side of the river, in the village of Krynky, in early July 2024.
Russian forces may have shifted from targeting Ukrainian forces in Krynky to targeting the broader western bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson, Stepanenko told CNN.
Analysts say Russian troops appear to be deploying large numbers of drones for several reasons – one of which is a pressure to show they are maintaining fire, to avoid being moved elsewhere.
“At least in part, there’s this element of these forces trying to show that they’re doing something, so that they’re not pulled to a different front line, like the Pokrovsk direction,” Stepanenko said. “It’s also to experiment with the new drones that they have.”
Disturbingly, multiple Russian bloggers have bragged online about fatal drone strikes.
Several Russian military blogger accounts on Telegram posted about an unofficial “Red Zone” in Kherson at the beginning of September, declaring that “all critical infrastructure” and “any vehicular movement will be considered a legitimate target.”
After that, there was an uptick in videos posted on Telegram that appeared to show Ukrainian civilians being attacked or running from drones, with Russian commentators mocking them.
One video filmed from overhead, geolocated by CNN, shows an explosive device being dropped on a Ukrainian woman riding a bicycle in Antonivka, with comments calling her derogatory names and claiming they will “find her” because she is the daughter of a Ukrainian soldier. It detonates very close to her but she pedals on.
Another aerial video posted online shows a man in civilian clothing trying to hide from a drone under a tree. CNN was unable to geolocate the video, but the Russian Telegram account that posted it blogs about the Kherson region specifically. The blogger claimed it shows a member of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and mocked the man for crawling on all fours.
ISW reported that unofficial Russian Telegram channels have claimed their forces are trying to destroy all vehicles so that Ukrainian forces can’t move. “But if you look at the footage, it actually shows a lot of civilian vehicles” being hit, Stepanenko said.
Although the Russian military has not officially commented on the “Red Zone” in Kherson, civilians in the region told CNN they are aware of the declaration and are scared to become a target for Russian drones.
‘It’s like a safari on us’
Intentionally directing attacks against civilian infrastructure and civilians who are not directly taking part in hostilities are considered war crimes under international law.
Russia has been repeatedly accused of targeting Ukrainian civilians by Kyiv, its Western allies, the International Criminal Court and the United Nations. Throughout the war, Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations, despite substantial evidence to the contrary.
Meanwhile, residents of the Kherson region say no target here seems to be off limits.
On Monday, an ambulance was hit in a Russian drone strike on an urban area of Kherson, injuring two paramedics. It marks the second drone attack on an ambulance in recent weeks, with another hit in early October about 15 miles south of the city. A 49-year-old woman and the 60-year-old ambulance driver were seriously injured, according to the region’s military administration.
“In recent months, it has been impossible to leave the house,” said Natalya, 46, another Antonivka resident, who asked to be identified by her first name only due to safety concerns. She was injured in the same strike on the humanitarian aid shelter as Tetyana Yakovleva.
“We survived the occupation here. We also survived the flood. But these drone attacks are unbearable,” Natalya told CNN. “It’s like a safari on us.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/politics/defense-secretary-lloyd-austin-ukraine-visit/index.html,Defense Secretary Austin arrives in Ukraine amid Russian gains and imminent US election,2024-10-21 05:31:00,"Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv early Monday morning, as the future of US aid to Ukraine hangs in the balance of the imminent US presidential election and as Russia continues to make small but steady gains on the battlefield.
Austin met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov while in Kyiv to discuss Ukraine’s weapons needs and how the US can continue to support the country’s military over the next year.
After their meeting, Zelensky wrote on X that he discussed expanding the use of long-range strike capabilities against Russian military targets.
A US defense official said that during their meeting, Austin emphasized to Zelensky the importance of Ukraine defending the territory it has taken inside Russia’s Kursk region and capitalizing on those gains, as well as fending off the Russians in the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk. They also discussed how Ukraine can shore up its manpower, as the military has struggled lately with force regeneration and recruitment.
Much of Austin’s later meeting with Umerov and Ukrainian Armed Forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi was also focused on Kursk, the defense official said, and the officials drilled down on military planning there for the next several months.
The secretary’s visit was also meant to serve as a moment for him to “step back” and look at the “arc” of the US-Ukraine relationship over the last two and a half years of war, a senior defense official said.
It was not a victory lap, however. The Ukrainians are in a “very tough” situation against the Russians heading into winter, the official noted.
That is despite the heavy Western sanctions imposed on Russia’s economy in response to its invasion, billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment the US has surged to Ukraine, and the multinational coalitions that the Biden administration rallied from the earliest days of the war to help Ukrainian troops beat back Russian advances.
Loud explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in the early hours of Monday local time, according to a CNN producer on the ground, in a stark illustration of the daily bombardments the country still faces more than 2.5 years into Moscow’s grinding war. City authorities said air defenses have been activated.
Austin, and the Biden administration more broadly, sees multinational coalitions as a key aspect of his legacy as defense secretary, particularly the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — an alliance of 57 countries and the European Union that Austin first convened two months into the war to coordinate immediate military aid to Ukraine.
“It’s been absolutely remarkable that Ukraine has been able to do what it’s done,” Austin told reporters traveling with him on Sunday night. “It’s been able to do that, of course, because of the fact that we have supported them from the very beginning, and we’ve rallied some 50 countries to be a part of that support.”
In his speech at the Kyiv Diplomatic Academy on Monday, Austin rebuffed critics who say the US should not be spending so much money on Ukraine.
“For anyone who thinks that American leadership is expensive — well, consider the price of American retreat,” he said. “In the face of aggression, the price of principle is always dwarfed by the cost of capitulation. Our allies and partners know that. And I’ve been proud to watch the pro-Ukraine coalition dig deep.”
US officials hope the coalitions will endure, but a potential Donald Trump victory has thrown much of that into doubt. The former president declined last month to say whether he wants Ukraine to win the war, and he has described Zelensky as a “salesman” who “should never have let that war start.”
Austin appeared to allude to that comment in his speech, as well, saying: “We refuse to blame Ukraine for the Kremlin’s aggression. We refuse to offer excuses for Putin’s atrocities. And we refuse to pretend that appeasement will stop an invasion.”
The senior defense official said the Pentagon is still planning as though the US’ support will continue, and Austin said Friday that “every day, we are building long-term capability to Ukraine.”
“None of us are strangers to political uncertainty in the US, or in Ukraine for that matter,” the defense official said.
US officials are also banking on the hope that bipartisan support for Ukraine will remain in Congress. But that, too, is far from inevitable — there has already been one major fight on Capitol Hill this year about approving additional funding for Ukraine, a dispute fueled by far-right Republicans opposed to Ukraine aid whose influence will only grow under a potential Trump administration.
A murky path to Ukrainian victory
Austin arrived on Monday in a country still waging a brutal fight for its existence. Zelensky has ruled out ceding any territory to the Russians and continues to lobby for Ukraine’s integration into NATO as the best path to victory.
“The first point is an invitation to NATO, now,” Zelensky said last week, referring to the first point of his “victory plan” that he has presented to the US, Europe and NATO.
Paradoxically, though, NATO is unlikely to accept Ukraine as a member as long as the country is at war.
Ukraine has prevented Russian President Vladimir Putin from achieving “one single strategic objective” during the war, Austin said Sunday. But the secretary did not articulate the West’s vision for how Ukraine can decisively win.
Russian troops have continued to take Ukrainian territory, are outfiring the Ukrainians 3-to-1 on the battlefield, and maintain a “significant” advantage in personnel and munitions, a senior NATO official said last week. Meanwhile, Iran has sent Russia three shipments of ballistic missiles this year, and North Korea has provided 11,000 containers of ammunition and appears to be preparing to deploy troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine. China also continues to be a “critical enabler” of Russia’s war effort, the NATO official said.
To be sure, the war has come at a steep cost for Russia, which suffered more than 1,250 casualties per day in September, the highest rate since the war began, the official said. But Moscow is also mobilizing 30,000 new troops per month and manufacturing more than 3 million munitions per year, a pace it can likely continue for at least “the next few years,” the official added.
Ukraine has more sophisticated weaponry thanks to the West, which could give the country a strategic edge, the defense official said. “In terms of the capabilities, Ukraine is in a much stronger position this year than they were a year ago,” the official said. The flow of donations of ammunition is also “much steadier” and “more predictable” now, the official added.
But Russia maintains the advantage in terms of sheer mass of personnel and munitions. And the US is still not prepared to allow Ukraine to use US-provided long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia, which Zelensky has repeatedly requested.
Ukraine has instead been using its domestically produced long range drones to strike targets inside Russia. Umerov, the Ukrainian defense minister, said on Monday that Ukrainian drones have destroyed 200 military facilities inside Russia so far.
Still, Austin said he is confident that the US and its allies will continue to step up into the next year to support Ukraine, whoever is in power.
“I do think allies and partners will continue to rise to the occasion,” he said Sunday night. “And we’ve invested in things that will soon come to fruition, in terms of additional systems like NASAMS (surface-to-air missiles). We made those investments a year and a half, two years ago, and we’ll start to see some of that come to life here soon.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/europe/moldova-eu-referendum-democracy-interference-intl/index.html,Moldova backs joining EU by razor-thin margin as President Sandu condemns ‘assault’ on democracy,2024-10-21 09:04:08,"Moldovans have voted by the thinnest of margins in favor of joining the European Union, near-complete results showed Monday, as President Maia Sandu condemned an “unprecedented assault” by foreign actors on the country’s democracy.
With more than 99% of votes counted, 50.4% had voted “yes” in the pivotal referendum on whether to enshrine in the country’s constitution a path towards the EU, according to the Central Election Commission.
Sandu, who framed the vote as a choice for the former Soviet country between pursuing its nascent European future or remaining lodged within the Kremlin’s orbit, said the results meant Moldova had won its first difficult battle in its push to join the EU.
But the margin of victory – far slimmer than polls had predicted – will come as a blow to Sandu, who had been hoping for a clear endorsement of the pro-EU path she has charted during her first presidential term.
Despite winning more first-round votes than she did in 2020, Sandu also failed to secure enough votes to win outright in the country’s presidential election, held on the same day. A second round will be held on November 3.
In an uncharacteristically forceful statement issued late Sunday night, Sandu accused foreign groups of attempting to undermine Moldova’s democratic process and “using the most disgraceful means to keep our nation trapped in uncertainty and instability.”
Sandu said Moldovan authorities had “clear evidence that these criminal groups aimed to buy 300,000 votes – a fraud of unprecedented scale.”
CNN reported last week on the efforts of a Kremlin-linked network, spearheaded by the exiled Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, to buy votes in Moldova, aiming to sway the results of the EU referendum.
In a video posted to his Telegram account last month, Shor had said he would pay voters the equivalent of $28 for registering with his campaign and more if they voted against the referendum.
Partial results also put Sandu first in the presidential race with 42.3% of the vote, ahead of her closest challenger Alexandr Stoianoglo – a former prosecutor general running for the pro-Russian Party of Socialists – with 26.1%. Before Sunday’s vote, he had been polling at just over 10%.
The two will now face off in the second round. If other pro-Russian parties and voters throw their support behind Stoianoglo, the November 3 run-off could be extremely tight.
A ‘difficult’ night
Speaking to CNN after what he described as a “difficult night,” Nicu Popescu – who was Sandu’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration until earlier this year – said Shor’s allies in Moscow will be pleased with their efforts to destabilize Moldova’s electoral process.
“They think the scheme has worked,” Popescu said.
For much of Sunday night, it appeared as though the “no” vote would prevail. But as the votes of Moldova’s large and mostly pro-European diaspora began to trickle in from abroad, the “yes” vote crept into the lead in the early hours of Monday morning.
“Everybody on the pro-European side is very grateful to the diaspora, because they saved democracy in the country,” Vadim Pistrinciuc, director of the Institute for Strategic Initiatives, a think-tank in Moldova, told CNN.
He said he was surprised by the “efficiency” of the Kremlin-linked vote-buying scheme, which he said “should be a wake-up call” to Moldova’s authorities.
Once the final results are in, Sandu said, “We will respond with firm decisions.”
Last week, US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, “Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration” and had dedicated “millions of dollars” to its campaign.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who before Sunday’s votes had rejected accusations that Moscow is interfering in Moldova’s political process, said the results “raise many questions,” since the overnight recovery of the “yes” vote is “mechanically difficult to explain.”
Pressing ahead
Despite the narrow margin of victory, Monday’s vote looks set to keep Moldova on its path toward eventual EU membership.
Sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova has veered between pro-Western and pro-Russian courses since it emerged as an independent country from the ruins of the Soviet Union.
Its accelerated path toward Europe has been spurred by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which shattered many Moldovans’ image of Russia as a benign big brother and created a determination in Brussels to prevent Moscow making further political inroads into formerly Communist states.
Since the start of Russia’s invasion, Moldova has weaned itself off its dependence on Russian gas and moved closer to Europe than at any point in its post-Soviet history. Buoyed by Sandu’s progress in combating corruption in the country, Moldova was granted EU candidate status in June 2022.
But Moscow still casts a long shadow in the country, most visibly in Transnistria, a sliver of territory which illegally split from Moldova during a brief war in the 1990s. Russia still has some 1,500 troops stationed in Transnistria, which is home to more than 220,000 Russian nationals.
The region even asked Moscow for “protection” in February this year, in the face of what it described as “increasing pressure from Moldova.” The government in Chisinau dismissed the move as “propaganda.”
In fact, Moldova has helped sustain the Transnistrian economy, by keeping gas flowing there since Moscow cut off supplies through Ukraine.
Still, Transnistria will prove an obstacle in potential EU accession talks, said Maksim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
“I don’t think Moldova can realistically join the EU without solving the Transnistria dispute first,” he told CNN.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/20/politics/paul-whalen-interview/index.html,Whelan says he fed information to Western officials that he received from fellow prisoners fighting in Ukraine,2024-10-20 17:20:51,"Paul Whelan, the American who spent five and a half years wrongfully detained in Russia, revealed Sunday that he had passed to Western officials information he received from fellow prisoners who were fighting for Russia on the frontlines in Ukraine.
“The prisoners from the camp that went to the frontline, they had communication. And they would communicate with us. And the communication from them I was passing back to the four governments,” Whelan said on CBS’ ‘Face the Nation,’ referring to the US, the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland — the four countries with which he holds citizenship.
Whelan added that he and others were able to communicate with former prisoners through “burner” phones that they could acquire even while at the Russian labor camp in Mordovia.
“Through illegal cell phones,” Whelan said. “Yeah, we had burner phones.”
Whelan added that the guards “looked the other way” in exchange for goods such as cigarettes.
“A Russian prison guard gets three, four hundred dollars a month. You give him a carton of cigarettes and you can do just about anything you want,” Whelan added.
During his years of detention, consular officials from the four governments would regularly meet with Whelan to check on him and provide updates on efforts to secure his release.
Whelan said that 450 prisoners from his camp went to fight in Ukraine as part of recruiting efforts by mercenary outfits including the Wagner Group, which signed up tens of thousands of prisoners from jails across Russia to bolster Russia’s brutal invasion. His camp was primarily made up of young men from central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, Whelan said.
“From my camp, 450 went. I knew all of them. Some of them are dead. Some have arms and legs missing. They’ve all got some sort of PTSD. They went through a traumatic experience,” he said. “They were used on the frontlines to walk through minefields. They were used as cannon fodder. They would be sent out in front of patrols to try and draw the enemy fire. That’s what Russia is doing with these people. And they’re all young. Putin is throwing away a generation of his youth in the Ukraine for nothing.”
Whelan, a former US Marine, was released earlier this year as part of a sweeping prisoner exchange carried out between the United States and Russia. A total of eight people were returned to the Kremlin in exchange for the release of 16 people who were held in Russian detention, including four Americans, in the historic swap that was the result of years of complicated behind-the-scenes negotiations involving the US, Russia and Germany.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/20/europe/europe-poland-asylum-summit-russia-intl/index.html,"Europe’s centrists are flocking to the right on migration, as a far right surge and a border crisis spooks the continent",2024-10-20 04:00:48,"One year after his election victory sparked a rare round of relief and optimism among Europe’s establishment, Poland’s leader made a startling announcement.
Donald Tusk, a former European Union Council president whose longstanding ties to Brussels have cast him as both a savior and a scapegoat in Poland’s toxic political landscape, said on Saturday he planned to temporarily halt the right to claim asylum in Poland – adding he’d fight the EU on the matter if he needed to.
“It is our right and our duty to protect the Polish and European border. Its security will not be negotiated. With anyone,” Tusk wrote on social media, in language more typically associated with the authoritarian populist bloc he defeated one year ago this week.
The move, unleashed for maximum impact on that anniversary, came in response to an intractable crisis at the Polish border with Belarus, which Europe says is fueled by Russia. At the same time, it seemed to fly in the face of one of the EU’s founding principles – and Tusk’s uncompromising tone took Europe by surprise.
But perhaps it shouldn’t have. Increasingly, Europe’s centrist figureheads are dropping their once-high-minded rhetoric on irregular migration, reaching instead for positions that were previously the preserve of the continent’s populist rabble-rousers.
Border checks at all of Germany’s frontiers were introduced last month. France’s new interior minister has hinted that immigration curbs are imminent. Both countries have been unsettled in recent months by high-profile murders in which migrants were identified as suspects, and by a surge in support for far-right parties.
Across the continent, countries are looking with serious interest at Italy’s controversial new agreement to ship migrants to Albania, which began this week.
And while European leaders expressed a catalog of competing concerns about a tenuous EU migration pact during a summit in Brussels on Thursday, those advocating for a more welcoming approach – like Spain’s Pedro Sanchez – were conspicuously outnumbered.
“Most politicians in Europe know that they can’t win on migration unless they propose something along the lines that Tusk is proposing,” Jacek Kucharczyk, the president of Warsaw-based think tank the Institute of Public Affairs, told CNN.
Tusk has the political capital in Europe to push the issue, and is keenly aware that the question of illegal migration can sink a centrist government if ground is ceded to the far-right. French President Emmanuel Macron narrowly avoided that outcome this summer and Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz is slipping behind the far-right AfD in opinion polls.
In Poland, like in much of Europe, “voters across the board expect that border security and migration controls are the priority,” Kucharczyk said. “There is very little room for maneuver for any politician.”
A Russia-fueled crisis
Tusk had been posturing for a fight this week, telling Poles he would “demand recognition” from Europe of his suspension of asylum. And at first, the European Commission gave him one; a spokesperson told CNN on Thursday that member states have “an obligation to provide access to the asylum procedure,” and Europe should seek a solution to Belarus border situation “without compromising on our values.”
But later that day, leaders instead expressed “solidarity” with Poland, and paved a path towards tougher bloc-wide measures, writing: “Exceptional situations require appropriate measures.”
The Belarus situation is certainly exceptional. Belarus has long been accused of encouraging migrants to reach the Polish border, at the behest of its ally Russia, in the hopes of exposing cracks in the EU’s border-free principles and common asylum system.
But Thursday’s victory for Tusk in Brussels underscores a broader, rightward shift across Europe on the issue of irregular migration. The continent’s new vocabulary includes concepts like external “return hubs” to which asylum seekers are sent – a fringe idea just two years ago that now holds serious weight.
EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Scholz, as well as Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer – the continent’s centrist flagbearers, each at one time hailed as counterweights to anti-migrant populism – have scrambled over each other to emphasize the consideration and thought they are giving to Italy’s arrangement with Albania.
Its architect, Italy’s right-wing leader Giorgia Meloni, was expected to be something of an outcast on the European stage when she took office two years ago. Now, more and more leaders are sounding more and more like Meloni.
European arrivals are in fact coming down; there have been around 140,000 this year, compared to a seven-year high of around 275,000 last year.
But instability and displacement in the Middle East, the success of populist parties in virtually every part of the continent this year and a number of violent attacks allegedly committed by migrants – which have been quickly pounced upon by right-wing politicians, sometimes aided by a flow of misinformation – mean that the potency of the topic is only mounting.
It has left migrant rights groups increasingly isolated. The International Rescue Committee called the opening of Italy’s offshore centers a “dark day for the EU’s asylum and migration policies” and said it hoped that the protocol would not be a blueprint for others. “Keeping people trapped behind barbed wire, deliberately out of sight and out of mind, is not a sustainable solution to Europe’s migration challenges,” IRC’s EU advocacy director, Marta Welander, said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday.
Scholz looks on as the far-right surges
Still, if Europe is heading in the same direction on illegal migration, it remains disunited.
A long-awaited new EU migration pact, aimed at sharing the burden of processing asylum claims more evenly across the bloc, has been picked apart from various angles by the 27 leaders. Some want it implemented sooner; others, including Tusk, have said they won’t accept relocated asylum seekers.
There is an evergreen issue at the heart of Europe’s latest divide; it is made up of 27 leaders who each have their own, domestic audiences at the front of their minds. But all of them have learned by now that public anger towards increasing legal and illegal migration is an indelible political force.
In Poland, Tusk is attempting to bend it towards his will. The veteran of centrist politics has banked some credit with voters one year after his election victory, but the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party he ousted last October remains a dangerous force, and its attacks on Tusk are primarily two-pronged: that he is a stooge of Brussels, and weak on the border.
There are caveats to Tusk’s plan. It is more targeted towards the Belarus border crisis than the initial language suggested; it is not immediate and its path to becoming law is tenuous. It is not entirely new – Finland has pursued a similar plan this year – and it is an escalation of, not a break with, Tusk’s stance on border security, which has always centered on efforts to repel the massing crowds in Belarus.
But tellingly, most of those details were missing from the prime minister’s initial announcement. “Tusk amplified the message (on asylum) on purpose to get attention,” Kucharczyk said. “The migration and security narrative was something that PiS has been using very successfully over the years; now Tusk has stolen it from them, and turned it against them.”
Tusk will hope this gambit sets the table for May’s election to succeed Poland’s PiS-aligned, veto-happy president – a contest that is absolutely pivotal to the government’s legislative hopes. “It’s an existential issue for this coalition, and they don’t want to take chances on issues like migration,” Kucharczyk said.
Scholz may be looking on with envy. Tusk has staked out a hardline position on the border before the issue tanks his popularity, but for the German leader, it may already be too late.
Scholz, whose SPD party is on course to lose power next year, has been slow to react to public anger, ignited most recently by a fatal stabbing in the western city of Solingen. The suspect was identified as a 26-year-old Syrian man with alleged links to ISIS, who had been due for deportation.
Days later, the AfD scored the first far-right state election victory in the country since the Nazi era – a breakthrough that spooked Europe.
That context informed Scholz’s sudden move to introduce checks at Germany’s western borders, in addition to checks that had already existed on its eastern flank. Hungary and Slovakia have made similar moves.
The wider question is whether the longstanding principles of the border-free Schengen Area can survive an enduring era of rising migration and populist subversion.
Its answer may depend, in part, on how successfully Europe’s current crop of centrists can take the fight on migration to their populist rivals – and whether they can maintain a reputation for moderation while doing so.
On that, Tusk seems willing to chart the course. But from the left, there are risks. “Tusk’s voters may applaud the security dimension (of his asylum plan),” Kucharczyk said. “But they will also want to see how (he) is different from the hard right.”",['Rob Picheta'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/europe/moldova-presidential-election-eu-referendum-russia-intl/index.html,Moldova faces a tug of war between Russia and the West in two crucial votes,2024-10-18 08:36:31,"Voters in Moldova are casting their ballots Sunday in two crucial votes, which have been billed as the most consequential in the country’s post-Soviet history. One is for president, the other a referendum on eventual European Union membership; neither appears safe from pro-Russian meddling.
Some of those voting have been offered the chance to make a quick buck. Ilan Shor, a Moldovan oligarch with links to the Kremlin, has said he’ll pay people for working to elect a Russia-friendly candidate and stop the referendum passing.
Since being convicted in absentia for his role in stealing $1 billion from Moldovan banks in 2014, Shor has spent much of his time in Russia, where he has set up a political movement that Moldovan officials claim is attempting to interfere with the country’s presidential election and EU referendum.
Alongside a more sophisticated misinformation campaign, Shor has resorted to cruder methods to meddle with Moldovan politics. In a video posted to his Telegram last month, Shor said he would pay voters the equivalent of $28 if they registered with his campaign, with the prospect of more for good results.
“If you have worked well and most people in your area voted against (the referendum), the bonus that you receive personally from me on your card will be 5000 lei ($280),” he said.
Authorities say Shor’s offer is part of a wider campaign attempting to sway the two votes, which could determine whether Moldova continues its path toward the West or remains lodged within the Kremlin’s orbit.
Moldova, an eastern European country of some 2.5 million people sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, has veered between pro-Western and pro-Russian courses since the end of the Cold War.
Russia still has some 1,500 troops stationed in Transnistria, a sliver of territory which illegally split from Moldova as the Soviet Union crumbled and has since been run by pro-Russian separatists.
But Moldova’s pro-Western camp has dominated since 2020, when Maia Sandu – a Harvard-educated former World Bank official – won the presidential election by a landslide, promising to clean up the country’s judiciary and combat corruption, a major issue. Her Party of Action and Solidarity won a majority in parliament the next year. She’s now seeking a second presidential term and is considered the frontrunner.
As in many formerly Communist countries, Moldovan politics was rocked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Home to a Romanian-speaking majority and large Russian-speaking minority, many Moldovans had long viewed Russia as a benign big brother. But as Russian troops swept across southern Ukraine toward the port city of Odesa – near Moldova’s eastern border – and more than 500,000 Ukrainian refugees fled to Moldova, many in the country realized their own vulnerability to Russian aggression.
“We’re very grateful to Ukrainians because they defend not only themselves, but us – and maybe half of Europe,” Vadim Pistrinciuc, director of the Institute for Strategic Initiatives, a think tank in Moldova, told CNN.
Russia’s invasion drastically accelerated Moldova’s path toward EU membership. Although Sandu had set her sights on joining the bloc, Moldovan officials understood this was a distant prospect, said Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s then-foreign minister and deputy prime minister.
“But when the war started it changed the conversation entirely,” Popescu, now a distinguished policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN. Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, was granted candidate status in June 2022.
The war has even ended Moldova’s near-total reliance on Russian gas, albeit at a cost. The country was plunged into an energy crisis when Russia’s Gazprom sharply cut gas supplies and hiked its prices, in what Moldovan officials alleged was an attempt to punish Sandu for tacking closer to Western Europe. With winter approaching, Moldova swiftly had to arrange alternative energy supplies from Europe. As of late last year, it no longer buys gas from Gazprom. “Moldova can’t be blackmailed anymore,” the country’s energy minister said this year.
Opposition ‘lost its self-identity’
Polling suggests that many in Moldova have been impressed by Sandu’s first term. A CBS-AXA poll found more than 36% of Moldovans supported Sandu, placing her far ahead of any of her 10 opponents.
If no candidate wins 50% of the vote on Sunday, a second-round vote will be held on November 3.
Sandu’s closest rival, former prosecutor general Alexandr Stoianoglo, trails with just over 10% of support among those surveyed. But analysts say his platform is a measure of the state of disarray in which Russia’s war in Ukraine has left Moldova’s opposition parties.
Despite running for the traditionally pro-Russian Party of Socialists, Stoianoglo says he supports Moldova joining the EU – something that would have been “unimaginable just a few years ago,” according to Maksim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
“The war has destroyed their self-identity,” Samorukov told CNN, referring to the country’s Russia-friendly politicians. “They don’t know how to combine the new reality of Russia waging a bloody, brutal war against their neighbor, with their past slogan of… Russia as a traditional elder brother of Moldova.”
‘Russia is financing this’
Instead, officials say Russia is pouring more resources into trying to swing the EU referendum, when Moldovans will be asked whether they support constitutional changes that could lead to the country joining the bloc.
Moldova’s national police chief, Viorel Cernauteanu, said earlier this month that more than 130,000 Moldovans had been bribed by a Russia-managed network to vote against the referendum. He said more than $15 million had been transferred last month alone, to buy votes and even to pay people as much as $5,500 to vandalize public buildings, Reuters reported.
“It is clear that Russia is financing this,” Cernauteanu said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected accusations that Moscow is interfering in Moldova’s political process. “There are still many people in Moldova who support the development of good relations with our country,” he said at a briefing this week.
Alongside alleged vote-buying, Pistrinciuc said Moldovans have been bombarded by online propaganda. The messaging includes highly personal attacks against Sandu and warnings that joining the EU will lead to war and the foisting of LGBTQ ideology upon the country.
The online campaign is “so big it’s incomparable to the size of the country,” Pistrinciuc said.
While Moldovan officials are alarmed, Samorukov said the campaign of meddling was also a sign of Russia’s waning influence in the country.
“It reflects the loss of the national allure of Russia in Moldovan society,” he said. “It also reflects the total laziness and cynicism of the Russian leadership, who have just given up on any soft power techniques and resorted to the crude buying of votes.”
Popescu said that vote-buying can only achieve fleeting results: When the money dries up, so will the support. “It mainly works for people who don’t have strong convictions, people who are disappointed, who traditionally don’t vote,” he said. “There’s limits (to what can be achieved).”
But even if Sandu prevails in both the presidential vote and the EU referendum, he expects the Kremlin’s campaign to continue. “It’s more about destabilization and building stronger fundamentals for Russia-supported candidates for the parliamentary elections next year,” he warned.",['Christian Edwards'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/asia/north-korea-ukraine-russia-troops-uniform-intl/index.html,North Korean troops seen being equipped in Russia ahead of likely deployment to Ukraine,2024-10-19 14:15:28,"North Korean soldiers have been filmed receiving uniforms and equipment at a training ground in Russia’s far east, appearing to confirm reports from South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) that 1,500 soldiers have been shipped over for military training to be deployed in Ukraine.
The North Korean troops are thought to be receiving training before being sent to the front line in Ukraine, in what is thought to be a clear sign of the ever-warming relations between Moscow and Pyongyang.
In a video shared with CNN by Ukrainian government organization the Ukrainian Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security, a long line of soldiers can be seen queuing to receive their uniforms. The soldiers are thought to be speaking Korean, although the low-quality audio prevented their discussions from being fully understood.
Upon arriving in Russia, the North Korean recruits have been asked to fill out a questionnaire providing their sizing for hats, headgear, uniforms, and shoes. In a copy of the questionnaire shared with CNN, the top of the form is written in Russian while the various size options are written in Korean.
Another video circulating on social media, geolocated by CNN, showed troops arriving at the Sergeevka Training Ground close to Russia’s border with China. In the video, a Russian speaker can be heard in the background saying “we can’t film them,” before adding: “There are more…there are millions of them here. Here are the new reinforcements. This is just the beginning. There are more.”
This evidence appears to confirm Kyiv’s long-held concern that North Korea has been readying itself for a more direct role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had repeatedly sounded the alarm regarding Russia and North Korea’s deepening alliance, telling a NATO summit this week that “thousands” of North Korean troops were on their way to Russia.
“From intelligence that I have … they are preparing 10,000 soldiers, different soldiers, land forces, technical personnel,” Zelensky told reporters, describing it as an “urgent” development he had raised with the United States.
South Korean media previously reported that the North will send a total of 12,000 troops, although this figure was not included in the statement from the national intelligence service.
This could mark the first time North Korea makes a significant intervention in an international conflict. North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries with 1.2 million soldiers, but many of its troops lack combat experience.
Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its grinding war in Ukraine, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers.
The two nations, both pariahs in the West, have forged increasingly warm ties since Russia’s invasion.
During Putin’s visit to the North Korean capital in June, the two countries pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked, part of a landmark defense pact agreed by the autocratic nations.
Putin said during that trip that the two countries were ramping up ties to a “new level.”
In remarks ahead of talks between the two, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un voiced his “full support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,” pointing specifically to Moscow’s war in Ukraine “to protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.”","['Isaac Yee', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Niamh Kennedy']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/politics/nato-ukraine-aid-us-election/index.html,US election looms over NATO discussions to Trump-proof Ukraine aid,2024-10-18 14:48:48,"The imminent US presidential election hung over a meeting of NATO defense chiefs this week, as NATO allies braced for US support for Ukraine to shrink over the next year if Donald Trump wins even as Iran, North Korea and China step up their military aid to Russia.
In a closed-door meeting with his counterparts on Thursday at NATO, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke about the upcoming election in response to questions about it from allies and how it might impact Ukraine aid, saying he can’t predict the future but that there is still bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress, according to sources familiar with the meeting.
NATO officials say they are preparing for the US to take on a lesser role.
“We can’t expect that the US will continue to take on an outsized burden” in supporting Ukraine, a senior NATO official said on Thursday, “which is why the Secretary General wants to see NATO leading on security assistance, rather than one ally taking that on.”
“Europe needs to step up even more,” the official added.
A potential Trump victory has thrown the future of US aid to Ukraine into doubt. The former president declined last month to say whether he wants Ukraine to win the war, and has described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a “salesman” who “should never have let that war start.”
The timing, to some officials, could not be worse.
“I’m very worried,” the NATO official said. “Optimistic is not the word I would use to describe the situation [in Ukraine] right now.”
Russia has continued to make small, tactical gains inside Ukraine, is outfiring the Ukrainians three to one on the battlefield, and maintains a “significant” advantage in personnel and munitions heading into the brutal winter months, the official said. And President Joe Biden remains opposed to allowing Ukraine to use US-provided long range missiles to strike deep into Russia, a policy that many NATO officials disagree with.
“I don’t think there’s anybody that would argue that there are not valid and legal targets in Russia that would have a battlefield impact” for Ukraine, the NATO official said. “Ukraine needs to have a range of capabilities that it can target those with.”
Secretary Austin suggested on Friday that Ukrainians’ own cheaply made long-range drones were a better way to take out targets inside Russia like ammunition depots than expensive, precision-guided missiles. “The UAVs have proven to be very effective and accurate,” he said, referring to the unmanned aerial vehicles.
Allies attempt to ensure long-term support
More broadly, the uncertainty over the US’ future role in large part spurred NATO to consolidate authority over the training of Ukrainian troops and provision of military assistance, giving Europe more control if the US decides to slow or halt aid to Ukraine under a Trump administration. But that mechanism, known as NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, is not yet fully operational and won’t be for several more months, another NATO official said on Friday.
European nations, meanwhile, are trying to ramp up production of key weapons and equipment, not only to maintain aid to Ukraine if the US withdraws support, but also to ensure their own security in the face of the Russian threat.
Trump said earlier this year that he told a NATO-member country that the US would not protect them against a Russian invasion if they didn’t meet NATO spending guidelines, and that he would “encourage [Russia] to do whatever the hell they want.”
An EU and G7 plan to help secure long-term funding for Ukraine’s military and reconstruction is also in limbo. Hungary is blocking a change to EU sanctions on Russia’s frozen assets that is necessary to issue a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using the windfalls from those assets, saying a decision should wait until after the US election.
The Biden administration has been scrambling to ensure Ukraine has what it needs for a long-term fight, and Biden is now “emptying out” all of the congressionally allocated funds for Ukraine, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O’Brien said at a conference in Riga on Friday. The administration has also been investing “billions” in Ukraine’s defense industry so it can make its own munitions, O’Brien said.
“Every day, we are building long-term capability to Ukraine,” Austin said on Friday. “That will help to spell success for Ukraine in the long haul.”
North Korea, Iran and China surge support to Russia
It’s unlikely the West will be able to catch up to the Russians in the near future, however.
Russia alone is producing around 3 million munitions per year, while NATO collectively is producing less than 2 million annually, NATO officials said on Thursday. That’s up from only tens of thousands of rounds per year a few years ago, but still falls short of what Ukraine needs.
Russia can sustain its high level of munitions production for at least the next few years, the senior NATO official said, because it is producing very low-tech weaponry like dumb bombs and has moved its entire economy to a war footing.
Russia is also getting significant help from North Korea, which has provided Moscow with 11,000 containers of ammunition consisting of around 2 million artillery rounds since last year, according to the senior NATO official. North Korea has also shipped 1,500 soldiers to Russia for training, South Korea’s spy agency said on Friday.
Iran, meanwhile, has sent three shipments of ballistic missiles to Russia, and China continues to be a “critical enabler” of Russia’s war effort, the NATO official said.
Austin has tried to reassure allies that the US is working to surge domestic weapons and equipment production so that US military aid can continue to flow to Kyiv through at least the next year. And at a meeting with NATO’s Indo-Pacific partners on Thursday, Austin and his counterparts discussed defense supply chains, NATO officials said, to try to identify and source raw materials needed for increased weapons production.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Thursday that he was confident the alliance “will not lose” its unity when it comes to Ukraine. And on Friday, he made a thinly veiled dig at those characterizing aid to Ukraine as a handout.
“Supporting Ukraine is not an act of charity,” he said. “It is also an investment in our own security. Because the cost of letting (Russian President Vladimir) Putin have his way would be much higher than the cost of supporting Ukraine.”",['Natasha Bertrand'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/europe/zelensky-ukraine-victory-plan/index.html,Zelensky unveils ‘Victory Plan’ to Ukrainian parliament after failing to drum up additional support from allies,2024-10-16 13:09:41,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky presented his long-anticipated “Victory Plan” to Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday, after failing to drum up additional, tangible support last week during meetings with European allies.
The plan, which consists of five points and three additional “secret” points shared only with certain partners, would be a bridge toward future peace talks with Russia, Zelensky told lawmakers in Kyiv, as he aims to bolster Ukraine’s position enough to end the war.
At the heart of Zelensky’s plan is Ukraine’s desire for an invitation to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which would be a precursor to full NATO membership, but something that Ukraine’s allies have been cool on with the country still at war with Russia.
It also outlines provisions to strengthen Ukraine’s defense, implement a non-nuclear strategic deterrence package and grow Ukraine’s economy.
“If we start implementing this Victory Plan now, we may be able to end the war no later than next year,” Zelensky said in a plea to his own lawmakers and more crucially, Ukraine’s backers abroad.
But many of the provisions in the plan have already been floated by Kyiv.
The Ukrainian president first presented the victory plan to US President Joe Biden during a September visit to the White House. The Biden administration ordered a surge of additional assistance for Ukraine during that visit and unveiled a $375 million aid package, but stopped short of meeting Kyiv’s demands for permission to strike deeper into Russia.
Biden has repeatedly said the US and allies “have to support Ukraine on its path to membership to both the EU and to NATO, and to continue to make reforms to counter corruption,” but an invitation to join has not yet been extended.
In the lead-up to his public announcement this week, Zelensky discussed the peace plan with leaders in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany and the head of NATO – a tour that ended without any countries publicly supporting the plan.
Commenting on Ukraine’s victory plan on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a true peace plan would require Kyiv to “sober up” and realize “the futility of the policy they are pursuing.”
Five-point plan
The first point of Zelensky’s peace plan is a call for Ukraine to become a member of NATO and ultimately the European Union – two alliances Kyiv has long been pushing to join.
Secondly, his plan outlines proposals to strengthen Ukraine’s defense, including improving air defense systems and reiterating a push for allies to ease restrictions around the use of long-range missiles to hit targets deep inside Russia – something the US has repeatedly denied.
The proposals come as Ukraine is facing setbacks on the eastern frontline, with Russia claiming incremental advancements in the Donetsk region and continuing to attack Ukrainian cities with drone and missile strikes. Ukraine is focused on preparing for winter, as it faces renewed Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure.
On Wednesday, Zelensky also called for “joint defense operations with our neighbors in Europe to shoot down Russian missiles and drones within the range of our partners’ air shield.” However, then-NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg poured cold water on that idea in July, saying the bloc would not become part of the conflict.
The plan also calls for the continuation of Ukraine’s operations in Russia’s Kursk region, which experts have called an important bargaining chip for Kyiv as it rejects calls to concede its own territory.
Zelensky reiterated on Wednesday that Ukraine will not accept a “freeze” or concessions “trading Ukraine’s territory or sovereignty.” Russia has been seeking to capture Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.
“We hear the word ‘negotiations’ from our partners, and the word ‘justice’ is much less frequently used. Ukraine is open to diplomacy, but to honest diplomacy,” Zelensky said. “That is why we have the Peace Formula. It is a guarantee of negotiations without forcing Ukraine to accept injustice. Ukrainians deserve a decent peace.”
The plan also includes a new proposal for deploying a “comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its soil that will be sufficient to protect Ukraine from any military threat from Russia,” Zelensky said, arguing that a strong deterrent would force Russia to “join an honest diplomatic process to bring the war to a just end,” or be guaranteed to lose its war.
He did not give further details about what a non-nuclear deterrent would look like in practice, though.
Zelensky’s final pillars for peace are to grow Ukraine’s economic potential and look ahead to a post-war plan. Zelensky argued that the strength and experience of Ukraine’s military could be used to strengthen European defense after the war and eventually replace certain US forces in Europe.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/europe/elite-ukrainian-drone-unit-russia-intl-cmd/index.html,Exclusive: Inside a secretive Ukraine drone unit targeting Russian territory,2024-10-16 10:00:38,"The spluttering roar of a propeller punctuates the perfect silence. Car headlights flick on, splitting the darkness. Their beams reveal not just a section of tarmac ahead, but one of Ukraine’s most top-secret weapons, controlled by its most clandestine agency.
Stuck to the nose of the gray machine is a yellow emblem of an owl, wings spread and grasping a sword – the unmistakable logo of Ukraine’s defense intelligence, the GUR.
Two pilots sporting the same owl patches on their fatigues make their final checks inside the car before a thumbs up: “Let’s go!”
A high-speed, 50-second chase ensues, before the 13-foot long, 23-foot wingspan AN-196 Liutyi drone disappears in an instant into the inky-black Ukrainian night.
The drone’s destination is a target deep inside Russian territory.
CNN was granted unprecedented exclusive access to one of Ukraine’s long-range drone units, part of the GUR. Its members call themselves the Long-Range UAV Unit.
Only two people were authorized to speak on the record, and then only using their callsigns: Serge, the long-range drone operations commander of GUR, and Vector, unit commander. Serge said he had personally overseen more than 500 long-range drone attacks into Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
CNN spent two days traveling across the country with the drone unit as it prepared to launch more than 100 drones overnight into September 29 on a mission into Russia. CNN is not disclosing the location of the sites visited for operational security reasons.
Their target: an ammunition facility, specifically train carriages sitting inside the depot loaded with recently delivered Iranian missiles, according to the Ukrainians.
Sources told CNN in September that Tehran had recently completed the delivery of short-range ballistic missiles to Russia. Iran has vehemently denied supplying any. “Iran has NOT delivered ballistic missiles to Russia. Period!” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi recently stated on his X account.
The facility sits on the outskirts of the tiny village of Kotluban, in the Volgograd region of southwestern Russia.
Long-range drone attacks have become an increasingly prominent part of the Russia-Ukraine war. As the land war has become more attritional, the air war has gathered speed, with the major development being in drone warfare.
In September, the unit’s drones hit a Russian ammunition depot between Moscow and St. Petersburg, in Tver region. The attack on Toropets, the Ukrainians claimed, resulted in the destruction of a depot storing Iskander tactical missiles, as well as aerial glide bombs and artillery munition. The strike caused massive explosions, visible for miles.
And in July the Ukrainians say they hit an oil refinery on Russia’s Black Sea coast, causing a major fire there.
But Russian air defenses thwart many Ukrainian drone attacks. The GUR’s success rate, the unit tells CNN, could be transformed from 50% to 95% if the United States gave permission to use Western weapons in attacks on Russian soil.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned, however, that Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack, singling out a mass launching of drones as one potential example.
Vector said many of Russia’s airfields, the origin-point of many of the air raids it conducts against Ukraine, are out of range. His drones, while highly effective, are not always that efficient – swarms of them are required to ensure their targets are hit. “Of course, we can send the UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and we destroyed many places. But it’s not enough,” Vector says.
“We’re not asking only about the permission to send the missiles anywhere in Russia, we speak about the weapons which can help us to move this war from our territory,” Vector adds.
Inside the mission
Serge and Vector have been leading their unit’s attempts to hurt Putin at home.
Regardless of targets, their missions follow a rigid set of operating procedures that include meetings at various locations across Ukraine.
In an underground office with dark brown, seemingly never-ending Soviet corridors, Serge sits across from Vector in a white-walled room. No pictures hang on the wall, even the whiteboard remains blank. The meeting is to the point.
“There will be about 12 drones,” Serge says to Vector, who has a map in front of him detailing the target and range of the Russian air defense and electronic warfare systems. They then agree the target approach time of around 3 am and the launch intervals for the drones.
Vector scribbles two notes before standing abruptly and saying, “Everything is clear. Ready to complete the task.”
Outside on the street, Vector climbs into his vehicle. He beckons the CNN team to follow him, phones turned off.
As dusk draws in, the convoy pulls into a compound, articulated lorries lined up. A tiny room with a desk and two sets of bunk beds serves as the only light source for miles around.
Men dressed in black, balaclavas over their faces, wait to hear their orders. Vector delivers a short brief, adding that this mission will also involve other units. He orders his men to start preparing the routes and hands over a small USB key containing the information for the mission ahead.
“Any questions?” he asks. “None? Okay. Let’s get working.”
As his men scatter across the compound, Vector explains that the planning phase of these missions is critical. “Planning is maybe 60% part of the success, everything depends on the planning,” he tells CNN.
He points to the quality of Russia’s air defenses, especially over the past 12 months. “We’re successful guys and we find the windows,” he says, but it’s a challenge.
Each drone will be programmed with more than 1,000 different waypoints, to evade Russia’s comprehensive air defense systems. There is tacit acceptance from Vector that some of this resembles a video game.
“It looks like we play with them,” Vector says jokingly, “but it’s not a game. It’s a war.”
Serge adds that not all men in his unit are career soldiers like him. He has served more than 20 years in the Ukrainian army and began flying drone missions in 2014 as Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions split away from Kyiv.
Decoy machines
In a warehouse, a Liutyi drone, produced predominantly in Ukraine, wingless for the time being, stands surrounded by green camouflage-painted crates containing multiple Rubaka kamikaze drones.
Vector explains that these smaller drones are crucial to the success of any mission. The aim is simple: to overwhelm the air defenses and draw Russian fire away from the Liutyi, which often carries a payload as great as 250 kilograms (550 pounds).
“They’re very simple, and we can use them with and without payloads,” he says of the smaller drones.
Cracking open one of the crates, he pulls out one of the decoy machines. Strips of metal foil have been added to the wings to fool Russian radar.
“We try to mix them, and we try to send them from different distances, different launch places… they try to destroy them. They send helicopters and missiles, they turn on the radio electronic warfare,” Vector explains.
Their targets are only military targets, Vector states. “Russia came inside our country. They destroyed a lot of electricity, a lot of houses, cities, villages.” But, he adds, “not all of them are stupid, and when they understand that war can come to them like they come to us, they will change something in their country. They will change the politics.”
One of the many articulated lorries has backed up for loading. In near darkness, drone bodies, followed by wings, are loaded three per truck by men whose faces are totally covered by balaclavas, and strapped down, ready to be taken to their launch sites.
Across other parts of Ukraine roughly 80 other GUR operatives are preparing 90 other drones, not all the Liutyi, for flight.
Some 30% of all the drones being launched will be on decoy missions, Serge says. The drones have been programmed to fly anywhere between 450 and 550 miles, with the Liutyis being the spearhead, destined for the small town-turned-ammunition hub of Kotluban.
The men load the warheads carefully into the bodies of the drones. Each compartment is then sealed with the squeal of a drill.
Serge and Vector, now in full combat uniform, observe the final preparations. This launch is one of the largest Serge has ever conducted, he says.
“Maybe (the Russian people) don’t understand what’s going on in Ukraine, but when these UAVs arrive, they understand clearly what we have been living (with) for the past 10 years,” Vector chimes in.
Tracking the drones’ flight
In total darkness, the drones are pushed into position. The car with the pilots moves in behind. The propeller spurts into life and the pilots ensuring a smooth takeoff begin their high-speed chase down the tarmac. Once airborne the fully autonomous drone starts ticking off the myriad waypoints.
Vector hurtles after the drone before slamming on the brakes and proclaiming “perfect.” He turns the car around and blasts a patriotic song from his radio.
Earlier, he told CNN: “I don’t want my son or other children to have a war in the future, so I want to finish it in my life.”
Back at the planning base, the hours tick by and Vector, Serge and others keep tabs on the drones via trackers.
The success of the mission is monitored in three ways, they say: through human intelligence on the ground, the messages seen on Russian Telegram groups and, later, analysis using satellite technology. Only once all three have been assessed can a mission be deemed a success or not.
As the 3 am arrival window nears, Serge starts reading out messages he is seeing from Telegram channels across Russia. The widespread nature of this attack starts to become clearer. Various cities in southern Russia – Voronezh, Yesk, Rostov and Volgograd – all start reporting drones arriving in their airspace.
One video from Voronezh shows one of the decoy drones whizzing overhead. An audio clip of a woman in clear distress at what is happening above her head leaves Vector laughing.
Through these Telegram channels, he says, “we understand that we are having some success.”
Initial satellite imagery of the ammunition depot in Kotluban shows scorched fields, a result of burning grass, but seemingly little evidence of major explosions within – apparent signs of a near miss.
However, the GUR shared with CNN a video from the region of the depot. CNN was able to independently view and verify aspects of the video without a blur to check its authenticity.
A defense intelligence source told CNN that their knowledge of the camera’s location, combined with its distance from Kotluban, allowed them to ascertain that the explosions inside the depot were large.
The video, sped up, shows 11 explosions all occurring in a 56-minute timeframe between 2:22 and 3:18 am – exactly the period during which the drones arriving from Ukraine were expected to land.
CNN was able to independently verify, through sources, that a direct hit on the facility had taken place. CNN is not publishing the image to protect the source’s anonymity, but it was taken within 72 hours of the attack.
The image shows a number of objects scattered around the building and a building badly damaged.
A later Maxar Technologies satellite image, also obtained by CNN, shows less debris in the vicinity – an indication that the Russian military had cleaned up the site – but the same building, heavily damaged.
The mission to destroy Iranian-delivered missiles was a total success, the Ukrainians insist.
As the drones were heading towards Kotluban, Serge told CNN: “We are constantly forcing the enemy to think about what they did in February 2022. They must realize that we are getting stronger every day and we are bringing our victory and their defeat closer.”","['Sebastian Shukla', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Frederik Pleitgen', 'Claudia Otto']",en

In his daily video message on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said: “We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea. It is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.”
Zelensky’s allegation comes amid an increasingly friendly relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea in June – the first visit of its kind for more than two decades – and Western observers have wondered how heavily North Korea has assisted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“Obviously, in such circumstances, our relations with our partners need to be developed. The frontline needs more support,” Zelensky added, reiterating his plea for Western nations to allow Kyiv to use long-range missiles in Russian territory.
A source in Ukrainian intelligence, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, told CNN last week that a small number of North Koreans have been working with the Russian military, mostly to help with engineering and to exchange information on the use of North Korean ammunition. Some of them were recently killed in eastern Ukraine, the source said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday dismissed allegations that North Korean personnel had been sent to help Russia as “another hoax.”
But South Korea’s National Intelligence Service said last week it is monitoring developments and believes the claim could be accurate.
Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun said it is “highly likely that the reported casualties of North Korean officers and soldiers in Ukraine are true, given various circumstances,” speaking at the annual parliamentary audit of the defense sector on Tuesday.
“We believe that the possibility of further deployment of regular troops is very high, as Russia and North Korea have entered a mutual agreement that is almost equivalent to a military alliance. We will also be well-prepared for this possibility,” he added.
Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its grinding war in Ukraine, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/13/europe/missing-ukrainian-journalist-dies-russia-intl/index.html,"Victoria Roshchyna: Ukrainian journalist dies in Russian detention, Kyiv says",2024-10-13 18:03:32,"Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna, who went missing in an occupied part of her country, died in Russian detention last month, Ukrainian authorities said earlier this week.
Roshchyna, who was 27, disappeared in August last year during a reporting trip to a Russian-occupied area in Ukraine. She was missing for months, with her loved ones having no idea what happened to her.
According to the Office of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Moscow only informed Roshchyna’s family she was detained in Russia in April, months after she was captured.
“I have official documentation from the Russian side confirming the death of Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna, who was illegally deprived of her liberty by Russia,” Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Dmytro Lubinets, said in a statement.
CNN has asked Russian authorities for comment, but received no answer.
Roshchyna’s colleagues said she traveled to the Russian-held territory – a dangerous ordeal for any Ukrainian – to report on the lives of people living under occupation. They said they believed the young journalist was killed by Russian authorities.
“We have every reason to believe that her death was either the result of a deliberate murder or the result of the cruel treatment and violence to which she was subjected during her time in Russian captivity,” Ukrainian journalists and media professionals said in a statement published in several Ukrainian media outlets.
The statement added that Roshchyna was healthy before her year-long imprisonment.
The Office of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General said it was investigating her death as a war crime combined with premeditated murder.
Journalist Evgeniya Motorevskaya, who worked with Roshchyna as the former editor of Hromadske, a Ukrainian media outlet, said the young reporter was determined to do her job as best as she could.
“For her, there was nothing more important than journalism. Vika was always where the most important events for the country took place. And she would have continued to do this for many years, but the Russians killed her,” she said in a statement published on Hromadske’s website, referring to Roshchyna by her diminutive.
Petro Yatsenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, said in a statement that some 25 Ukrainian journalists were being held in Russian captivity, and several others are considered missing.
The Ukrainian government says thousands of Ukrainians have been held in arbitrary detention in Russia. Lubinets, Kyiv’s human rights commissioner, said in July that 14,000 Ukrainian civilians were in Russian captivity, some of whom have been held since 2014 when the war broke out in eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea.
Yatsenko said that according to Russian authorities, Roshchyna died while being transferred from a detention facility in the southern Russian city of Taganrog to Moscow. He said the transfer was in preparation for her release as part of a prisoner exchange.
“Unfortunately, we did not have enough time,” he said in the statement.
Tetyana Katrychenko from the Media Initiative for Human Rights, a Ukrainian rights group, said the detention facility in Taganrog was known for its cruel treatment of detainees, according to a statement published on her social media.
CNN has previously reported on the widespread torture of Ukrainian prisoners by Russian authorities.
“Taganrog … is known as one of the most brutal places of detention for Ukrainians in the Russian Federation. It is called hell on earth,” Katrychenko said, adding that Roshchyna was held in Taganrog from at least May to September 2024. “She was held in solitary confinement,” she added.
Roshchyna was awarded the 2022 Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women’s Media Foundation. Her work appeared in a number of media outlets including Ukrayinska Pravda, Hromadske and Radio Free Europe.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Svitlana Vlasova', 'Kostya Gak']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/12/europe/ukraine-kursk-russia-incursion-putin-intl/index.html,"Kursk offensive: As Ukraine’s incursion into Russia enters third month, Putin is trying to downplay it",2024-10-12 09:00:38,"Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region is now entering its third month, with scores of settlements still firmly under its control.
The operation marked the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II – embarrassing the Kremlin and proving to Kyiv’s backers and the rest of the world that Ukraine’s military was not perpetually on the back foot.
Some nine weeks later, Ukraine’s advance has stalled, and neither side has made major gains or counterattacks in recent days.
The endgame is unclear. Analysts believe Kyiv is trying to use its initial momentum for a morale boost and a potential bargaining chip, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to downplay the entire incursion and limit the resources Russia’s war machine devotes to countering it.
What’s the latest on the ground?
Ukraine has maintained a foothold in Kursk of about 786 square kilometers (300 square miles), according to the latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank in Washington, DC.
“Russian advances are mostly happening on the flanks of our foothold,” a commander of a Ukrainian battalion inside Kursk, Dmytro – who uses the call sign “Kholod,” meaning cold – told CNN on Wednesday. “They keep trying to advance but the gains are incremental, somewhere they manage to take a street in the village. But it goes both ways – we also counterattack and push them back.”
Ukraine’s main foothold is around the Russian town of Sudzha and its military is trying to establish a second foothold around Veseloe village. Ukraine has not disclosed how many troops it has sent to the region.
Russia has deployed a reasonably large number of troops – estimated at 40,000 – to defend and counterattack in Kursk, but analyst Mark Galeotti described the initial force as “built from wherever they can find,” with Russia using conscripts and reservists at the outset of the incursion.
“This is equivalent to sort of scramping around your sofa cushions to find some small change,” Galeotti, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a British think tank, told CNN.
Moscow has since deployed more experienced forces, but not as many resources as Russian civilians in Kursk would perhaps want.
As fighting in the area continues, Russian authorities say more than 100,000 civilians have been displaced, while many others find themselves living behind Ukrainian lines.
“Over time, there is a degree to which the Kursk operation has become normalized,” Galeotti said. “We shouldn’t assume that Russians have just come to accept it… I think Putin has managed to postpone judgment, but I don’t think it’s been completely waived.”
Why hasn’t Russia’s response been stronger?
Russia is trying to avoid diverting any resources from the frontlines of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine to fight in Kursk.
Although the incursion was initially a shock to both the government and ordinary Russians, “the Kremlin has played this down,” according to John Lough, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia Program. “The strategy is to distract the population from what’s happened, which is undoubtedly a major embarrassment, and to create the impression that this is not serious.”
Putin’s government has characterized it as a “raid” and even downplayed their counterattack as a “counterterrorism mission.”
One Russian military blogger put the normalization into stark words, saying: “Most of Russia has already got used to the fighting near Kursk… Those who have nothing to do with the Kursk region are rather sluggishly interested in what is happening.”
Frontlines are moving only slightly, but the fighting is reportedly fierce, with Russian forces deploying numerous drones, barrel artillery and aerial bombers, according to the Ukrainian commander.
“They don’t hesitate to drop a bomb on a tree line if they assume we have troops there,” Ukrainian battalion commander “Kholod” said. He claims Russia has now sent a powerful group of troops and combat brigades to where his unit is fighting in Kursk, and argued the Russian counterattack was staved off by Ukraine’s drone and mine attacks.
What has Ukraine achieved?
The incursion into Kursk likely had multiple goals, analysts say, including giving Ukraine a narrative win.
“Their goal was to demonstrate to Ukraine’s Western allies that the Russians are vulnerable and that there are limits to their ability to deploy combat power,” said Lough, adding that the incursion also highlighted how “Russia’s red lines are rhetorical.”
It also provided a morale boost for Ukrainians. Several soldiers who spoke to CNN in September said that despite casualties and difficult operations, giving Russia a taste of its own medicine was worth the fight.
Yet Ukraine’s goal of diverting troops from the eastern frontline to Kursk has so far failed.
Kursk could still be a bargaining chip for negotiations in the future, though, experts said.
“By taking this territory, they immediately ruled out the possibility of both the Russians and the Western allies saying, ‘Now it’s time to stop. Let’s have a ceasefire,’” Lough said.
Focus still on eastern Ukraine
Meanwhile, the primary focus of the war remains on the frontlines in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where its troops are fighting to retain control of the strategic city of Pokrovsk.
Rather than focus resources on liberating their own territory, the Russian military has expanded its assaults on multiple fronts in Ukraine, including in key areas of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia.
“It seems to be a very high priority for the Kremlin to advance as far as possible in Donbas, regardless of the losses,” Lough added. “There is a sort of window that is about to close, because you get to this time of year when the roads turn to mud.”
Russia’s daily attacks on Ukraine continued Thursday, with several people killed in the regions of Odesa, Kherson and Donetsk.","['Lauren Kent', 'Kosta Gak', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/world/putin-pezeshkian-russia-iran-intl/index.html,"Putin hails ‘very close’ links with Iran at landmark first meeting with president, as Middle East tensions soar",2024-10-11 09:10:41,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said he shares a “very close” worldview with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, as the sanctioned leaders held a friendly inaugural meeting just as the Middle East braces for Israel’s response to Tehran’s largest-ever missile attack last week.
The meeting at a regional summit in Ashgabat, the capital of the Central Asian country Turkmenistan, also comes against a backdrop of closer military ties between Iran and Russia’s military in recent years, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Iran has supplied thousands of “Shahed” attack drones to Russia, and according to US officials, built a drone factory in Russia. Iran also recently transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use in the war against Ukraine, CNN reported in September, marking a significant escalation in the country’s support for Moscow.
“We are actively working together in the international arena and our assessments of events taking place in the world are often very close,” Putin said during the landmark meeting, according to Russian state media outlet TASS.
“Since Ukraine, the two countries have been more equal in terms of both needing each other and relying each other on specific issues. And that, I think, has been seen as beneficial from the Iranian side,” said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, senior analyst and associate fellow, at UK think tank Chatham House and senior analyst at the consultancy Control Risks.
Moscow and Tehran have a de facto military alliance in the region to support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Analysts say the countries have found further common ground as they are increasingly isolated by global sanctions.
There is a perception in Moscow that Iran can teach Russia about the tools to evade sanctions, Bassiri Tabrizi noted, adding, “I think it’s overall a goal from the Iranian side, so that has been part of the broader conversation about being part of the BRICS,” the bloc of major emerging economies that Iran formally joined early this year.
Pezeshkian, a reformist who won Iran’s election in July following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, has already emphasized his desire to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Russia to counter the “cruel” sanctions of the West.
In a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in Tehran last week, the Iranian leader called for accelerating joint projects. Meanwhile, Russia expressed interest in expanding trade and economic cooperation as well as diversifying its bilateral trade with Iran.
The Russian prime minister also invited Pezeshkian to attend the October BRICS summit in Russia, where the two countries are expected to sign a comprehensive strategic agreement.
The Russian foreign ministry has touted these meetings as evidence that Russia-Iran relations are at an “all-time high,” according to TASS.
Ahead of the meeting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the agenda will focus on “primarily bilateral Russian-Iranian relations,” according to TASS. “But, of course, the situation in the Middle East will not be ignored, it will also be on the agenda. In any case, there will be a serious conversation.”
There have also been reports of Russian involvement in arms transfers to the Iran-backed Houthis. Viktor Bout, the Russian arms dealer who was exchanged in a prisoner swap for American basketball star Brittney Griner, has allegedly reentered the arms trade to broker the sale of $10 million worth of automatic weapons to the Yemen-based rebels, The Wall Street Journal and other Western media outlets reported this week, citing unnamed Western officials. Bout has denied that.
However, developments in the Middle East have not necessarily strengthened Iran-Russia relations, Bassiri Tabrizi noted, and some analysts argue that Russia stands to benefit from the conflicts involving Iranian proxies distracting from the war in Ukraine on the international stage.
“We know that Russia is very much focusing on what’s going on in Ukraine. It probably cannot stretch itself much in terms of delivery of technical and military capability to Iran beyond a certain point,” the Chatham House analyst told CNN in a statement. “While the relationship has been growing and is likely to continue to grow, there are going to be some continued tensions, some continued misalignment.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/politics/us-military-weapons-systems-ukraine/index.html,US military compiled list of American weapons systems that could help Ukraine in the war with Russia,2024-10-08 18:52:36,"The US military’s top commander in Europe compiled a list of weapons systems the US possesses that could help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that the Biden administration has not yet provided, including air-to-surface missiles and a secure communications network used by NATO.
In an annex attached to a classified report about the Biden administration’s Ukraine strategy that was delivered to Congress early last month, Gen. Chris Cavoli outlined a list of US capabilities that could help the Ukrainian military fight more effectively, according to people familiar with the report.
The list included the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, a type of air-launched cruise missile, and a communications system known as the Link 16 — a data sharing network used by the US and NATO that is supposed to enable more seamless communication between battle systems and is particularly useful for air and missile defense command and control. Ukraine has asked for both systems repeatedly, another source familiar with their requests said.
Cavoli’s list does not address why the US hasn’t provided systems that he assesses would be of value. But US officials have previously expressed concerns about sensitive US technology falling into Russian hands, which one source said is likely the holdup with the Link 16 system. The air-to-surface missiles, which are fired from fighter jets, might not be useful to the Ukrainians unless they achieve some level of air superiority, the source added.
Nearly three years into the war, the Ukrainians are still pleading with the US to provide more advanced weaponry and lift restrictions on how long-range missile systems provided by the US can be used. And with the US presidential election less than one month away, the future of the US’ support for Ukraine is uncertain, even as the US says it is working to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to last them through at least the end of 2025.
The Ukrainian government continues to lobby hard. When President Volodymyr Zelensky met with President Joe Biden at the White House late last month, he came armed with a detailed list—not of weapons, but of targets inside Russia that he wants to hit with US-provided long-range missiles, known as ATACMS, according to sources familiar with the meeting.
The list is a key part of Zelensky’s “victory plan” for winning the war. Biden, who has to date prohibited the Ukrainians from deploying the missile systems for deep strikes into Russia, was not entirely dismissive of the request, the sources said. But he was ultimately non-committal.
The leaders agreed to keep discussing the issue. But Biden won’t be meeting with Zelensky again in the near future after he canceled a trip to Germany for a gathering of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group this week, and it remains unlikely that the US will change its policy on long-range missiles, officials told CNN.
Broadly, US officials say they are giving Ukraine everything that the US military assesses Kyiv needs at this moment to support its fight. Officials also argue that that the US’ limited supply of long-range ATACMS systems are better used against targets in Crimea. The Ukrainians have already conducted several successful strikes deep inside Russia using their own long-range drones that have damaged Russia’s defense industrial base, US officials note — drones that in fact have a far longer range than the ATACMs.
US officials have also said that Russia has moved some of its most valuable targets outside of the ATACMS’ 180-mile range, anyway. The Ukrainians have argued, though, that there are plenty of Russian assets within range, including military bases and production and logistics facilities, that would make for strategic targets.
As a way to “Trump-proof” US security aid, should former President Donald Trump win in November, the US and its allies have been working on ways to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs through the end of 2025. NATO has established its own mechanism for facilitating aid and military training, which was launched in July. The Pentagon is also getting closer to offering contracts to private American companies to travel to the country and help with the equipment sustainment and logistics there, officials said, a key part of making sure Ukraine’s weapons and equipment don’t break down at key moments.
Broadly, though, the US is hoping that 2025 marks a turning point for Russia’s ability to sustain its own war effort.
Russia has lost hundreds of thousands of fighters in close to three years of fighting. To make any substantial gains on the battlefield, officials have long believed President Vladimir Putin will need to order another politically risky troop mobilization. And both US officials and independent analysts say that although the Kremlin has successfully shielded its economy from some of the bite of western sanctions in the near-term, there are some signs that its economy may begin to show strain by the end of next year.
Putin “always thinks Americans have attention deficit disorder,” CIA Director Bill Burns said during a national security conference in Sea Island, Georgia, on Monday. “This is one of those cases where we have to demonstrate the strength of our support for Ukraine, because there’s a lot riding on this.”
Still, critics say that the administration’s plan for victory in Ukraine remains fuzzy. According to one source who read the report, the classified strategy delivered to Congress defined victory only in vague terms of Ukrainian sovereignty and self-determination. In another classified annex, it suggested categorized that might be used to judge success, such as reclaimed territory, but provided no benchmarks.
For now, the picture on the battlefield remains fluid. Russia has made grinding gains in the country’s east, which officials see as Putin’s priority. Ukraine earlier in the year seized a huge swath of territory inside Russia that it continues to hold, for now, a move that some officials believe may stretch Kyiv too thin across the front lines in the east.","['Katie Bo Lillis', 'Natasha Bertrand', 'Kylie Atwood']",en

Dadin was once jailed in Russia for repeatedly protesting the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a series of peaceful street demonstrations. He was the first person to be convicted under a 2014 law that cracked down on public assembly and protests in Russia, according to Amnesty International.
He served two and a half years in prison and the article under which he was tried became known as “Dadin’s law.”
Dadin’s friend and former Russian lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev, who is living in exile, said Monday he was killed fighting in the Kharkiv region over the weekend.
“Ildar saw Ukraine as an ally in this struggle, and in forceful resistance the only way to defeat Putinism,” Ponomarev told CNN, adding that Dadin went to Ukraine in June 2023 and joined the country’s Siberian Battalion and later the Freedom of Russia Legion, a group of primarily Russian nationals fighting for Ukraine.
“He had a keen sense of justice, so when he saw that there was an injustice – a war, an invasion, people were dying – he had to correct that injustice,” Ponomarev added.
The Freedom of Russia Legion confirmed Dadin was one of their soldiers but declined to comment on his condition and status on Monday due to ongoing combat operations.
Several independent Russian media outlets also reported Dadin’s death on Sunday.
More strikes on Ukraine overnight
Russia continued its attacks on Ukraine overnight, with Ukrainian authorities reporting four people killed and at least 25 injured in attacks on the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson and Sumy regions.
Ukraine said it shot down 32 Russian drones and two missiles overnight and on Monday morning.
Ukraine also repelled a drone and missile attack on its capital on Monday. It marked the fourth Russian attack on Kyiv since the start of October, according to the head of the city’s military administration Serhiy Popko.
Meanwhile, the General Staff of Ukraine reported that it successfully struck an offshore oil terminal in Russian-occupied Crimea, near the city of Feodosia.
The Russia-appointed head of the Feodosia city administration, Igor Tkachenko, confirmed on Telegram that there was a fire at the oil terminal, which is the largest in Crimea. A state of emergency was declared in Feodosia due to the fire.

Hubbard, originally from Michigan, was accused of fighting against Russia for monetary compensation and pleaded guilty last month to charges of being a mercenary, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti.
Russian prosecutors alleged that Hubbard fought with Ukraine in the key city of Izyum, after signing a contract for about $1,000 per month, RIA previously reported. He was detained by Russian forces in April 2022.
“Yes, I agree with the charges,” Hubbard told the Moscow City Court in his September plea hearing.
His trial and sentencing took place behind closed doors in the Moscow court.
Hubbard’s sister, Trisha Hubbard Fox, previously said he held pro-Russian views and cast doubt on his confession, telling Reuters in an interview that “he never had a gun, owned a gun, done any of that… He’s more of a pacifist.”

The N1 TV reported that 21 people died and that dozens went missing in the Jablanica area, 70 kilometres (43.5 miles) southwest of Sarajevo.
The government is due to hold a press conference later.
“There are some villages in the area that still cannot be reached, and we don’t know what we will find there,” said a spokesperson for the Mountain Rescue Service whose teams are involved in search.
Heavy rain overnight halted search, Bosnian media reported, but as it stopped the search continued. In Donja Jablanica many houses were still under rubble.
Nezima Begovic, 62, was lucky. Her house is damaged, but she came out unhurt.
“I heard people screaming and suddenly it was all quiet. Then I said everyone is dead there,” she told Reuters.
Due to flash flooding on Friday a quarry above Donja Jablanica collapsed and rubble poured over houses and cars in the village.
Enes Imamovic, 66, said he was woken by loud noises at around 5 a.m. on Friday (11 p.m. ET Thursday).
“Everything was white (from the stones and dust that came down from the quarry), My friends’ house was gone. I heard screams,” Imamovic told Reuters.
The Bosnian Football Association (NFSBIH) has postponed all matches due to floods.
Bosnia’s election commission decided to postpone local elections this weekend in municipalities affected by floods, but to carry on with voting elsewhere.

Footage verified by CNN showed troops waving the Russian flag over the ruins of the city hall of the devastated town, whose population has dropped from around 14,000 to just over a hundred.
Ukraine’s military confirmed its withdrawal from Vuhledar Wednesday, noting Russia had managed to send reserves on the flanks, leading to the “threat of encirclement.” The decision to withdraw, it said, was taken “to save personnel and military equipment.”
A key goal of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is to take the whole of the eastern Donbas region. Russia has been making incremental gains this year in the east and the loss comes as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky returns from a meeting with US President Joe Biden without his key demands met.
Vuhledar, a town built around a coal mine (its name comes from the Ukrainian word for coal), sits some 50km (30 miles) south of Pokrovsk, viewed for the past few months as Russia’s main nexus of attack in the east.
While not a transport and logistics hub like Pokrovsk, Vuhledar was heavily fortified and viewed as a crucial bastion at the intersection of Ukraine’s eastern and southern fronts. One prominent Russian war blogger Boris Rozhin said this made the victory “operational, if not operational-strategic.”
“The fact is that this ‘balcony’ [an apparent reference to Vuhledar’s elevated position] was located at the junction of the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk fronts posed a constant threat to the grouping that covered the approaches to Mariupol,” he noted, referring to the southern Ukrainian city that has been in Russian hands since 2022.
Just like Avdiivka, another strategic eastern town which fell in February, Vuhledar is a victim not of Russian strategic prowess but brute-force attrition.
For two years Ukraine had put up a formidable defense there, as Russia tried and failed several times to take the town.
In February 2023, an attempted Russian assault on Vuhledar led to an uproar among pro-Kremlin military bloggers, as hundreds of Russian troops advanced right into the crosshairs of Ukrainian artillery, launched from the town’s high-rise apartment blocks.
Another Russian blogger, Voenkor Kotenok, alluded to this bittersweet victory Tuesday.
“It’s painful, Vuhledar or rather those who settled there, drank a lot of blood,” he said.
Now, it is Ukraine that will face the difficult questions.
A fresh blow to Ukraine
The fact that Russia was able to bring in sufficient reserves to encircle the town underscores the manpower advantage it still has, four months after Ukraine’s mobilisation law came into force.
“I confidently said that one would have to be a moron to allow our guys to be surrounded, but someone did,” wrote Stanislav Buniatov, a Ukrainian soldier and blogger, in a Telegram post. He claimed soldiers ended up withdrawing from Vuhledar in small groups, taking fire from Russian drones, and that the wounded were left “to be shot by the enemy.”
The timing of this loss will also be keenly felt in Kyiv.
It comes less than two months after Ukraine expanded the battlefield to Russia’s Kursk region – a move designed to ease the pressure on other fronts and help reverse Ukrainian fortunes after Russia spent the spring and summer gradually advancing in the east and opening a new front in the northern Kharkiv region.
It’s also just days since Zelensky returned from a politically-charged diplomatic blitz in the US with the promise of new aid, but no NATO-style security guarantees or permission to use Western missiles in Russia.
Just a week ago Zelensky told US network ABC that “we are closer to peace than we think.” The loss of Vuhledar means Ukraine now has to fight to stop Russia advancing further west, making the prospect of retaking territory even more remote.",['Clare Sebastian'],en

In February 2023, an attempted Russian assault on Vuhledar led to an uproar among pro-Kremlin military bloggers, as hundreds of Russian troops advanced right into the crosshairs of Ukrainian artillery, launched from the town’s high-rise apartment blocks.
Another Russian blogger, Voenkor Kotenok, alluded to this bittersweet victory Tuesday.
“It’s painful, Vuhledar or rather those who settled there, drank a lot of blood,” he said.
Now, it is Ukraine that will face the difficult questions.
A fresh blow to Ukraine
The fact that Russia was able to bring in sufficient reserves to encircle the town underscores the manpower advantage it still has, four months after Ukraine’s mobilisation law came into force.
“I confidently said that one would have to be a moron to allow our guys to be surrounded, but someone did,” wrote Stanislav Buniatov, a Ukrainian soldier and blogger, in a Telegram post. He claimed soldiers ended up withdrawing from Vuhledar in small groups, taking fire from Russian drones, and that the wounded were left “to be shot by the enemy.”
The timing of this loss will also be keenly felt in Kyiv.
It comes less than two months after Ukraine expanded the battlefield to Russia’s Kursk region – a move designed to ease the pressure on other fronts and help reverse Ukrainian fortunes after Russia spent the spring and summer gradually advancing in the east and opening a new front in the northern Kharkiv region.
It’s also just days since Zelensky returned from a politically-charged diplomatic blitz in the US with the promise of new aid, but no NATO-style security guarantees or permission to use Western missiles in Russia.
Just a week ago Zelensky told US network ABC that “we are closer to peace than we think.” The loss of Vuhledar means Ukraine now has to fight to stop Russia advancing further west, making the prospect of retaking territory even more remote.",['Clare Sebastian'],en

The government’s draft budget released Monday proposes spending just under 13.5 trillion rubles (over $145 billion) on national defense. That is about three trillion rubles ($32 billion) more than was set aside for defense in 2024, which was the previous record.
The Ukraine war is Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II and has drained the resources of both sides, with Ukraine getting billions of dollars in help from its Western allies.
Russia’s forces are bigger and better-equipped than Ukraine’s. In recent months the Russian army has gradually been pushing Ukrainian troops backward in eastern areas.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the United States last week in pursuit of continuing financial and military support as the war approaches its three-year milestone next February.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is also looking at how to sustain his war effort as military spending has placed a huge strain on the Russian economy.
Earlier this month, Russia’s central bank raised its key interest rate by a full percentage point to 19% to combat high inflation. It held out the prospect of more rate increases to return inflation from the current 9.1% to the bank’s target of 4% in 2025.
According to the draft budget, spending on defense should decline in 2026.
The proposed budget could still change as it goes through three readings in the State Duma, Russia’s lower parliament house, and then goes to the Federation Council, the upper house, before the Russian president signs it into law.
Meanwhile, on Monday Putin signed a call-up order for 133,000 conscripts in the autumn military draft, which is a routine number for seasonal conscription campaigns.
In September, he ordered the military to increase the number of troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million. Overall military personnel would be about 2.4 million.
Overnight, Russia fired missiles and drones at 11 regions in Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said Monday, in a 33rd consecutive night of aerial attacks behind the front line and setting a new monthly record in drone barrages.
It was the first time Russians launched more than 1,000 Shahed drones in a month. It was also the first time the Iranian-made drones were used in every aerial attack on each day of the month.
Drone attacks
In Kyiv, multiple explosions and machine gun fire could be heard throughout the night as the Ukrainian capital’s air defenses fought off a drone attack for five hours.
No casualties were reported in Kyiv or elsewhere, though a “critical infrastructure object” caught fire in the southern Mykolaiv region, Gov. Vitalii Kim said, without elaborating.
Russia has increasingly deployed Shahed drones, rather than more expensive missiles, in its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022.
It launched more than 1,300 Shahed drones at Ukraine in September alone, the highest number of drone attacks in a single month since the war began.
Ukraine, too, has developed a new generation of drones for the battlefield and for long-range strikes deep inside Russia. More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia on Sunday, Russian officials said.
Also Monday, Putin released a video marking the second anniversary of the annexation of four Ukrainian territories and again accused the West of turning Ukraine into “a military base aimed at Russia.”
Putin was speaking to mark the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine after a referendum held in 2022, which was denounced by the West as a sham. Russia also illegally annexed Crimea in 2014.
Since 2022, Putin said, businesses in the occupied areas are being “actively restored” and hospitals and schools are being rebuilt.
Thousands of Ukrainians have fled from the four regions as a result of Russia’s invasion, but Putin said Russia’s military operation in the country was to defend residents’ “well-being” and the “future for our children and grandchildren.”",[],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/27/politics/trump-zelensky-meeting/index.html,Trump set to meet Zelensky amid GOP tensions over Ukraine assistance,2024-09-26 00:00:00,"Former President Donald Trump said Friday that – if elected – he’s ready to work out a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, emphasizing his good relationship with Vladimir Putin even as the former president stood next to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump and Zelensky met in New York on Friday, giving the Ukrainian leader the chance to make a personal pitch to the GOP presidential nominee who is openly skeptical of continued US security assistance for Ukraine against Russia.
The tensions between the two men – both of whom had been critical of the other leading up to the meeting – were obvious during a pre-meeting Q-and-A with reporters.
“We have a very good relationship, and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin. And I think if we win, we’re going to get it resolved very quickly,” Trump told reporters ahead of his meeting with Zelensky.
“I hope we have more good relations between us,” Zelensky interjected.
“Oh, I see,” Trump said. “It takes two to tango, you know, and we will – we’re going to have a good meeting today. And I think the fact that we’re even together today is a very good sign.”
Friday’s meeting came at a pivotal moment for Zelensky ahead of November’s US election. He’s sought this week to convince the Biden administration that his country can still win the war, so long as the US and other countries significantly and quickly ramp up military assistance.
Trump has repeatedly complained about the funding the US has provided for Ukraine and claimed he will quickly end the war between the two sides, which began with Russia’s unprovoked invasion in February 2022. Zelensky said this week that Trump doesn’t know how to end Russia’s war on Ukraine.
“Hopefully, we’ll have a good victory, because if the other side wins, I don’t think you’re going to have victories with anything, to be honest with you,” Trump said of the race between him and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.
“So, we’re going to sit down (to) just discuss it, and if we have a win, I think long before I, before January 20, before I would take the presidency – it’s January 20 – but long before that, I think that we can work out something that’s good for both sides. It’s time,” Trump added. “By the way, the president (Zelensky) knows that too. He wants to get something done. He doesn’t want to do this.”
Zelensky thanked Trump for agreeing to meet with him, recalling how five years had passed since their last meeting, and said he believes they share a common view that Putin must be stopped.
“I think we have common view that the war in Ukraine has to be stopped, and Putin can’t win, and Ukraine has to prevail, and I want to discuss with you the details about that,” Zelensky said.
Trump says he ‘learned a lot’ but hasn’t changed his view of Russia-Ukraine war
After the meeting ended, Trump and Zelensky appeared together on Fox News. Trump reiterated that he thinks a fair deal is possible and can be done quickly even as Zelensky made it clear that he feels Russian troops must be pushed all the way out of Ukraine.
“I learned a lot, but I think I haven’t changed from the standpoint that we both want to see this end and we both want to see a fair deal made. And it’s got to be fair, and I think that’ll happen at the right time. I think it’s going to happen,” Trump told Fox News following the meeting.
“It should stop, and the president wants it to stop. I’m sure President Putin wants it to stop, and that’s a good combination. So, we want to have a fair deal for everybody,” Trump said.
When he was asked what he envisioned as “fair,” Trump said it was “too early to say that.”
“I have my own ideas and I’m sure the president definitely has his own ideas. But, has to be fair,” Trump said.
Zelensky chimed in reminding how Putin has invaded Ukrainian territory.
“This war shouldn’t be started, and I think that the problem that Putin killed so many people and, of course, we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war. He is in our territory. That’s the most important. He is in our territory and how to stop the war to pressure him as we can. We have to do it,” Zelensky said.
Trump said Zelensky “said it the best” that “this is a war that should’ve never happened” and said another meeting between them “could very well happen.”
Trump questioned how Ukraine could rebuild and restore its cities, saying “it’s not possible.”
“You have to, by the way, come to see all us,” Zelensky said.
“I will,” Trump said. “It’s a beautiful country.”
Zelensky’s crucial – but politically awkward – meetings in the US
Zelensky met at the White House on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Harris, and the Democratic nominee used the appearance to draw a stark contrast with Trump on Ukraine.
“There are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory, who would demand that Ukraine accept neutrality and would require Ukraine to forego security relationships with other nations,” Harris said.
Zelensky’s meeting with Trump one day after visiting the White House puts him once again in the middle of a heated US political campaign – five years after Zelensky was caught up in another US domestic political firestorm.
The last time Zelensky and Trump met occurred amid a Democratic impeachment investigation into Trump for denying Zelensky a White House visit and US aid to Ukraine while Trump tried to get the Ukrainians to announce an investigation into then-presidential candidate Biden.
Trump would ultimately be impeached by House Democrats over pressuring Zelensky to investigate Biden. The Ukrainian president, meanwhile, finally got a meeting in the Oval Office – with Biden – in September 2021.
Trump praised Zelensky – namely for being “like a piece of steel” during his first impeachment surrounding their phone call.
“He could’ve grandstanded and played cute, but he didn’t do that,” Trump said. “He said, ‘President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.’ He said it loud and clear, and the impeachment hoax died right there.”
GOP goes after the Ukrainian president
At a rally Wednesday, Trump criticized Zelensky and claimed the Ukrainian president “refuses to make a deal” with Russia, marking the former president’s most explicit criticism of Zelensky’s handling of the war to date.
“Those cities are gone, they’re gone, and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refused to make a deal, Zelensky. There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn’t have been better than the situation you have right now. You have a country that has been obliterated, not possible to be rebuilt,” Trump said during a campaign speech in Mint Hill, North Carolina.
Trump’s Republican allies in Congress are also furious with Zelensky for his visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant along with Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro. They’ve argued his visit to the key battleground state, which is home to a sizable population of people of Ukrainian ancestry, had partisan motivations, with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling on Zelensky to fire the Ukrainian ambassador to the US. Republicans have also taken issue with Zelensky calling Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the GOP vice presidential candidate, “too radical” in an interview with The New Yorker.
In the same interview, Zelensky criticized Trump, saying: “My feeling is that Trump doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how. With this war, oftentimes, the deeper you look at it the less you understand.”
Trump left things open-ended when asked Thursday whether he believes Ukraine should cede territory to Russia as a means of ending the war.
“We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at Trump Tower.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-republicans/index.html,Republicans follow Trump’s lead of icing out Zelensky,2024-09-25 21:25:15,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized Volodymyr Zelensky and claimed the Ukrainian president “refuses to make a deal” amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, marking Trump’s most explicit criticism of Zelensky’s handling of the war to date.
“Those cities are gone, they’re gone, and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refused to make a deal, Zelensky. There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn’t have been better than the situation you have right now. You have a country that has been obliterated, not possible to be rebuilt,” Trump said during a campaign speech in Mint Hill, North Carolina.
The comments come at the same time as a rising furor on Capitol Hill over the Ukrainian president among Republicans. In the House, GOP lawmakers are attempting to investigate what US taxpayer resources went toward supporting Zelensky’s security as he traveled to Pennsylvania while GOP senators are warning the Ukrainian to stay out of American politics after he called Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s vice presidential running mate, “too radical” in an interview that published over the weekend.
The latest line of Republican attacks speaks to the broader political divisions over US involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war. Republican leaders are so far declining to meet Zelensky while he is in Washington, DC, while Democrats are embracing the opportunity. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson are not currently scheduled to meet with the Ukrainian president, sources told CNN, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Vice President Kamala Harris are scheduled to have meetings.
It all amounts to a stark warning for the Ukrainian president, who has relied heavily on American support to fight off Russia’s invasion since it began in February 2022. While Zelensky has had strong backing from the Biden administration, Republican support for the continued funding of Ukraine’s defense has been eroding for months and now appears to be picking up speed.
In New York for the United Nations General Assembly, Zelensky warned world leaders of serious attacks coming on his country, saying the Russians are set to go after Ukraine’s energy supplies – including nuclear power plants.
“Ukrainians will never accept why anyone in the world believes that such a brutal colonial past – which suits no one today – can be imposed on Ukraine now, instead of a normal, peaceful life,” he said, asking for “support from all nations of the world” in securing peace for Ukraine.
Trump appeared unmoved.
“Every time he came to our country, he’d walk away with $60 billion. He’s probably the greatest salesman on Earth,” Trump said of Zelensky on Wednesday.
Trump says Ukraine should have given up territory to stop the war earlier
In his speech, Trump blamed Biden and Harris for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and claimed they “caused this situation by the stupidity of what they said, by every move they make, but they caused the situation and now they’re locked in.”
“They just don’t know what to do. They’re locked into a situation. It’s sad, they just don’t know what to do. Because Ukraine is gone, it’s not Ukraine anymore. You can never replace those cities and towns, and you can never replace the dead people, so many dead people,” Trump said.
He said making a deal earlier in the conflict to cede some territory to the Russians would have prevented more catastrophe. Trump argued Biden should have been able to orchestrate a deal between Russia and Ukraine that avoided any bloodshed and argued that even a “bad deal” and one where Ukraine had “given up a little bit,” would’ve been preferable to the war.
“A deal could have been made. There wouldn’t have been one person that died, and there wouldn’t have been one golden tower laying shattered on its side. A deal could have been made if we had a competent President,” Trump said.
But Trump argued the opportunity to make a deal no longer existed because of the destruction Putin’s war in Ukraine had caused.
“What deal can we make? What deal can we make? The, it’s, it’s demolished. The people are dead. The country is in rubble. And who are these people that allowed this to happen? Who are these people?”
When asked Wednesday on a call with reporters if he believes Ukraine should cede land in exchange for ending the war, Vance said “everything is going to be on the table,” but “nothing is going to be definitely on the table.”
“That’s why you have a negotiation, especially with a guy who’s as skilled as Donald Trump, is because he actually should try to have a conversation between both parties and other interested parties about how to bring this war to close,” Vance said on a call with reporters.
“As he said repeatedly, the killing has to stop,” Vance added. “It’s not an America’s interest. I don’t think it’s in Ukraine or Europe’s best interest for this thing to go on indefinitely.”
Vance said the “biggest problem” is how the war has “distracted and consumed a lot of resources at a time when Americans are suffering.”
Vance gave a glimpse at how a Trump-Vance administration would work to end the war, telling the Shawn Ryan podcast that he believes it could involve a “demilitarized zone” at the “current line of demarcation.”
House Republicans attack Zelensky
House Republicans launched a new line of attack against Zelensky on Wednesday, criticizing his recent visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant ahead of key meetings with Biden and other allies as part of his weeklong push in the US to shore up more support for his war effort.
Republicans are claiming that Zelensky’s visit to Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in the 2024 presidential election that is home to a sizable population of people of Ukrainian ancestry, was made to provide political support to Democrats.
Johnson called on Zelensky to fire Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, for organizing the recent trip to the Pennsylvania manufacturing site.
“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote Wednesday.
Meanwhile, House Oversight Chair James Comer launched an investigation into Zelensky’s use of a US aircraft to fly to the Pennsylvania facility.
“The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” Comer wrote in the letter sent to the White House, the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense on Wednesday.
James Adams, a Pentagon spokesperson, told CNN in a statement Thursday that the flight to Pennsylvania “was a U.S. Department of Defense-funded mission. The Department requested Military Airlift (MILAIR) support to facilitate travel for senior U.S. government officials from both the Department of State and the Department of Defense.”
The statement added, “These officials were conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, which included a stop at Newark Liberty International Airport, where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania.”
Senators warn Ukrainian leader to back off Vance criticisms
Zelensky said in an interview with The New Yorker that Vance was “too radical” and has sent the message the Ukraine must sacrifice its territory for peace.
“The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine’s expense is unacceptable. But I do not consider this concept of his a plan, in any formal sense,” Zelensky said. “This would be an awful idea, if a person were actually going to carry it out, to make Ukraine shoulder the costs of stopping the war by giving up its territories. … And it wouldn’t necessarily end the war, either. It’s just sloganeering.”
Vance’s Republican colleagues in the Senate sent a clear message to the Ukrainian president when asked about the remark on Wednesday.
Sen. John Cornyn, a member of Republican leadership who is running to replace Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell next Congress, told CNN that Zelensky should “stay out of American politics,” after Zelensky called Vance “too radical.”
“I think it’s a monumental miscalculation by President Zelensky,” said Cornyn. “If he wants support for Ukraine, he should stay out of American politics.”
Senate Republican Whip John Thune added, “I think it would be advisable for him to stay out of American politics,” when asked if it was appropriate for Zelensky to criticize Vance. “They have some differences on some issues but it’s not his place to litigate that here in the middle of an American election.”

The aid package, which is nearly double the size of recent shipments, includes artillery ammunition, air defense, anti-tank missiles and more of the critical weapons and equipment the US has provided Ukraine.
Earlier Wednesday, President Joe Biden and other world leaders signed a Joint Declaration of Support for Recovery and Reconstruction of Ukraine, promising support “in the future, in war and in peace.” The declaration comes with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visiting the US for the United Nations General Assembly, as well as meetings with the White House.
In his address to the UN, Zelensky called on the world to stand against what he called Russia’s “colonial war.”
“The world has already been through colonial wars and conspiracies of great powers at the expense of those who are small,” the Ukrainian president said. “Ukrainians will never accept why anyone in the world believes that such a brutal colonial past – which suits no one today – can be imposed on Ukraine now, instead of a normal, peaceful life.”
Zelensky will visit Washington, DC, on Thursday, where he will meet Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. In his meetings, Zelensky has promised to unveil his “victory plan” to defeat Russia. The plan includes Kyiv’s long-stated request to use US-manufactured long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia, an ask that the Biden administration has repeatedly denied. which the Biden administration has repeatedly denied.
On Wednesday, Biden promised to unveil a series of moves to support Ukraine’s military. The president said his administration is “determined to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to prevail in its fight for survival.”
Biden is also set to announce “significant” security assistance package for Ukraine on Thursday, sources familiar told CNN, including weapons and other capabilities.
The Biden administration has nearly $6 billion left in unused presidential drawdown authority that is set to expire at the end of the month. The authority allows the US to pull military arms and equipment directly from its own stockpiles to send to Ukraine. As CNN reported, the administration is expected to commit the remaining authority to Ukraine and send the aid shipments over the course of the next few months.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/europe/putin-nuclear-warns-west-missile-strikes-ukraine-intl-latam/index.html,Putin issues nuclear warning to the West over strikes on Russia from Ukraine,2024-09-25 19:27:19,"President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it was struck with conventional missiles, and that Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack.
The decision to change Russia’s official nuclear doctrine is the Kremlin’s answer to deliberations in the United States and Britain about whether or not to give Ukraine permission to fire conventional Western missiles into Russia.
Putin, opening a meeting of Russia’s Security Council, said that the changes were in response to a swiftly changing global landscape which had thrown up new threats and risks for Russia.
The 71-year-old Kremlin chief, the primary decision-maker on Russia’s vast nuclear arsenal, said he wanted to underscore one key change in particular.
“It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation,” Putin said.
“The conditions for Russia’s transition to the use of nuclear weapons are also clearly fixed,” Putin said, adding that Moscow would consider such a move if it detected the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft or drones against it.
Russia reserved the right to also use nuclear weapons if it or ally Belarus were the subject of aggression, including by conventional weapons, Putin said.
Putin said the clarifications were carefully calibrated and commensurate with the modern military threats facing Russia – confirmation that the nuclear doctrine was changing.
Russia’s current published nuclear doctrine, set out in a 2020 decree by Putin, says Russia may use nuclear weapons in case of a nuclear attack by an enemy or a conventional attack that threatens the existence of the state.
The innovations outlined by Putin include a widening of the threats under which Russia would consider a nuclear strike, the inclusion of ally Belarus under the nuclear umbrella and the idea that a rival nuclear power supporting a conventional strike on Russia would also be considered to be attacking it.
The United States in 2022 was so concerned about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia that it warned Putin over the consequences of using such weapons, according to Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns.
Confrontation
The 2-1/2-year-old Ukraine war has triggered the gravest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis - considered to be the closest the two Cold War superpowers came to intentional nuclear war.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been urging Kyiv’s allies for months to let Ukraine fire Western missiles, including long-range US ATACMS and British Storm Shadows, deep into Russia to limit Moscow’s ability to launch attacks.
With Ukraine losing key towns to gradually advancing Russian forces in the country’s east, the war is entering what Russian officials say is the most dangerous phase to date.
Zelensky has urged the West to cross and disregard Russia’s so-called “red lines,” and some Western allies have urged the United States to do just that, though Putin’s Russia, which controls just under one-fifth of Ukrainian territory, has warned that the West and Ukraine are risking a global war.
“Russia no longer has any instruments to intimidate the world apart from nuclear blackmail,” Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, said in response to Putin’s remarks. “These instruments will not work.”
Putin, who casts the West as a decadent aggressor, and US President Joe Biden, who casts Russia as a corrupt autocracy and Putin as a killer, have both warned that a direct Russia-NATO confrontation could escalate into World War Three. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has also warned of the risk of nuclear war.
Russia is the world’s largest nuclear power. Together, Russia and the US control 88% of the world’s nuclear warheads.
In his remarks to Russia’s Security Council, a type of modern-day politburo of Putin’s most powerful officials including influential hawks, Putin said that work on amendments on changing the doctrine had been going on for the past year.
“The nuclear triad remains the most important guarantee of ensuring the security of our state and citizens, an instrument for maintaining strategic parity and balance of power in the world,” Putin said.
Russia, he said, would consider using nuclear weapons “upon receiving reliable information about the massive launch of aerospace attack vehicles and their crossing of our state border, meaning strategic or tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, hypersonic and other aircraft.”",[],en

“Radiation does not respect state borders,” Zelensky said Wednesday in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Since Russia “can’t defeat our people’s resistance on the battlefield,” Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin is “looking for other ways to break the Ukrainian spirit.”
For a third winter, Russia is stepping up its strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid in a bid to plunge the country into the “dark and cold,” Zelensky said.
Zelensky’s address to the UN came shortly before he is set to discuss his “victory plan” with United States President Joe Biden, which is expected to include Kyiv’s long-stated request to use long-range missiles to strike military targets inside Russia.
In his speech Zelensky recalled the “horrifying” moment in the first weeks of the war when Russian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the largest in Europe, stirred fears among Ukrainians of another Chernobyl-style disaster.
“No one could know how Russian strikes on the nuclear facility would end, and everyone in Ukraine was reminded of what Chernobyl means,” he said.
Two-and-a-half years later, Zelensky warned the Russian-occupied ZNPP remains “at risk of a nuclear incident.” Russia and Ukraine have blamed previous incidents at the plant on each other. Ukraine has three other nuclear plants, according to the World Nuclear Association.
CNN has previously reported that the risk of a large-scale nuclear incident at the ZNPP is low, since Ukrainian operators put the plant’s reactors into a “cold shutdown” mode in June 2023.
If the plant’s reactors were to be blown open, the cold reactor would “expose spent fuel to the air, which will spread some radiation,” William Alberque, Director of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control at the International Institute for Strategy Studies, told CNN.
This would create a radiation zone where “you’ll have a higher chance of cancer over the next 40 years,” but will not recreate the sort of destruction seen after the meltdown of the active Chernobyl plant in 1986.
While the risk of a large-scale nuclear incident is low, the threat to Ukraine’s energy system remains high.
“Russia has destroyed all our thermal power plants, and a large part of our hydroelectric capacity,” Zelensky said. He said that 80% of Ukraine’s energy system had been disabled by Russia’s assaults.
Absent from Zelensky’s speech, however, was reference to Ukraine’s hopes to be granted permission to use Western weapons to strike targets deep into Russia.
Before traveling to the US, Zelensky told CNN that Ukraine’s request was a key part of his “victory plan.”
Radek Sikorski, Poland’s Foreign Minister, told CNN it is vital that Ukraine’s request be granted. He recalled a recent incident in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where an entire family was wiped out by a Russian missile strike.
“The missile that killed that family was launched from a Russian bomber flying over Russian territory from a Russian airfield. Give me one reason why Ukraine should not be able to take out that bomber and take out that airfield,” Sikorski said.
“The victim of aggression has the right to defend itself also on the territory of the aggressor,” he added, saying “we are making those arguments to the US.”",['Christian Edwards'],en

The first of the military aid packages, which is expected as soon as Wednesday, will total $375 million, according to the defense officials. From there, the value of the packages will rise sharply, with less than a week before the remainder of the authority expires. Although the packages will be announced in the near future, the shipment of weapons will be delayed because of dwindling stockpiles in the weapons and equipment that the US is willing to send Ukraine, as CNN previously reported.
With days left until the Ukraine aid authority expires, the Biden administration was still looking at a way to extend the authority through the end of the year. The plan requires the administration to obligate the funds to Ukraine before they expire at the end of the month, which would then give the US more time to announce specific aid packages.
“We are committed to making sure Ukraine gets the resources Congress approved before the end of the President’s term and we will have more details to provide soon,” a third defense official said.
The Biden administration has nearly $6 billion left in what’s known as presidential drawdown authority to deliver arms and equipment to Ukraine before it expires at the end of the month. The Pentagon was pushing Congress to extend the authority into the next fiscal year so that it would not expire, which would give the US more flexibility in its ability to provide critical supplies to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
Congressional leaders were forced to leave the language out of the spending bill because of internal resistance from the House GOP, according to a person familiar with the matter. House Republicans remain deeply divided over funding for Ukraine.
The House is expected to easily approve the stopgap spending measure Wednesday and then leave Washington until after the November election. The Senate could take up the funding measure as early as late Wednesday or early Thursday – the same day that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit the US Capitol.
Zelensky has repeatedly called on the US and other countries to deliver more weapons to Ukraine and has pushed for the US to loosen its restrictions on the use of US weapons against targets deep inside Russia.
On Tuesday, Zelensky told the United Nations that “Russia can only be forced into peace.”
“This war can’t simply fade away, that’s why this war can’t be calmed by talks. Action is needed,” Zelensky said.
CNN reported last week that the US was considering announcing large military aid packages to Ukraine that would be delivered over the course of months. In the past, military aid packages under presidential drawdown authority were often delivered within days or weeks.
But with billions in military aid set to expire, the US is expected to announce large overall aid package and space out the delivery of supplies and equipment over several months, turning a short-term supply line into a longer-term commitment.
“There is every intention that we want to use every dollar and cent of that authority,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a press briefing last week.

The accounts are linked to Rossiya Segodnya and TV-Novosti, the organizations behind the Sputnik news agency and the RT broadcaster respectively, the social media platform said on its website Monday, labeling the groups “state-affiliated.”
The move mirrors an announcement by Meta (META) last week that it had banned Rossiya Segodnya, RT and “other related entities” from its apps globally for “foreign interference activity.”
Rossiya Segodnya and RT did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment on the TikTok measure.
Earlier this month, the US Justice Department announced charges against two RT employees for funneling nearly $10 million into a US company, identified by CNN as Tenet Media, to create and amplify content that aligned with Russian state interests. The covert influence campaign was aimed at the American public ahead of the presidential election, US officials said.
Tenet Media boasts a slate of high-profile right-wing, pro-Trump commentators, including Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, Benny Johnson and several others. All of them released statements saying they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme.
After the Justice Department announcement, RT responded with mocking statements that did not address the specifics of the US allegations.
TikTok, for its part, has itself faced questions over whether or not the Chinese government can manipulate its algorithm to influence the American public.

Zelensky will fully outline his “victory plan” – which includes Kyiv’s long-stated request to use long-range missiles on targets inside Russia – to Biden for the first time during the visit before sharing it with both presidential candidates, US lawmakers and international partners, he said.
“This fall will determine the future of this war,” Zelensky posted on X from his plane before landing in the US. “Together with our partners, we can strengthen our positions as needed for our victory – a shared victory for a truly just peace.”
Zelensky kicked off his visit at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Biden’s hometown, where he thanked workers for providing Ukraine with munitions and said the facility would ramp up production of 155mm artillery shells crucial for Kyiv’s war effort.
“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” he said. “Thanks to people like these – in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries – who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.”
Zelensky has been pushing Ukraine’s allies to ease restrictions on weapons and although there have been signs of the US shifting its stance, he said Friday they have yet to be given permission.
“We do have long-range weapons. But let’s just say not the amount we need,” Zelensky told reporters, adding that “neither the US nor the United Kingdom gave us permission to use these weapons on the territory of Russia.”
He has blamed the allies’ hesitation to authorize such use on escalation fears, but said he was hopeful his arguments would be heard during his visit.
Zelensky is expected to travel to New York, where he will speak at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday and meet with leaders of the Global South, the G7, Europe and international organizations.
He will then travel to Washington for talks with Biden and Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.
“I want to see what she thinks about this victory plan,” he said of Harris on Friday.
“As I told you, the plan includes not only what is needed from Biden today. But it also includes the fact that we will have a different situation after November. That is, there will be a new president in the United States. And we need to talk to each of the candidates about their perception of this.”
Harris has expressed her support for Ukraine and NATO allies, indicating she would continue Biden’s policies of backing Ukraine, if she is elected president.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/europe/ukraine-western-long-range-weapons-russia-intl/index.html,Ukraine wants to fire Western long-range weapons into Russia. But the battlefield gain is not clear-cut,2024-09-22 04:00:19,"Next week, an already very public debate over whether Ukraine should be allowed to use long-range Western-supplied missiles on Russian soil will come under an even brighter international spotlight.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet not only US President Joe Biden, who has signaled he is open to discussing the issue, but also likely both US presidential candidates on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.
Those meetings come as experts say the public wrangling on this topic has raised the stakes of the decision, and potentially shifted the role these missiles - the Franco-British Storm Shadow/Scalps and US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) - might play in this expanding war.
It was almost exactly a year ago, also during an in-person meeting with Zelensky in the United States, that Biden made the decision to supply the ATACMS to Ukraine.
The news did leak out, but official confirmation only came a month later, Zelensky burying it at the end of a nightly address on October 18. “Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented,” he said. “And they are being implemented very accurately – ATACMS have proven themselves.” By that point the missiles had, according to US officials, already been used in several strikes on Russian-occupied Luhansk and the southern coastal town of Berdiansk.
A few months earlier, a similar story played out with the British Storm Shadows when then-Defence Secretary Ben Wallace only confirmed they had been supplied once they were already in use. In both cases, Ukraine promised not to use them on Russian territory.
This September, Zelensky is employing a strategy of more openly challenging his allies, and that, combined with Russia’s open threats that any lifting of restrictions on their use would mean war with NATO, has turned the issue of firing these missiles into Russia into a political touchstone, an ultimate determinant of the extent of Western support.
Zelensky has refused to allow the topic to fall out of the headlines - publicly criticizing his allies’ hesitation after a Russian strike on a military educational facility in Poltava killed more than 50 people earlier this month.
“Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,” he said.
Last weekend, after a Russian bomb attack on an apartment block in Kharkiv, he even made veiled accusations of cowardice, saying: “This terror can be stopped. But to stop it, the fear of making strong, objectively necessary decisions must be overcome.”
“Zelensky has taken a bit of a risk on this,” said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London. “He’s almost playing political chicken. He’s kind of daring people to support him.” If it happens though, the political dividend would be significant, says Savill, blunting Russian rhetoric and “demonstrating firm international support” for Ukraine.
As for the battlefield dividend, that, experts say, is less clear cut.
Opinion is divided on the extent to which the public debate around the missile permissions has blunted their potential utility - especially when it comes to targeting Russian fighter jets and missiles before they can be used against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure. US intelligence believes 90% of Russian aircraft that launch deadly glide bombs (at least 100 per day, according to Zelensky), are more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory, so outside of ATACMS range. And that number may be increasing. Russia recently relocated planes from two bases near the border further east, according to one US official.
Savill agrees “lots of the juiciest targets” have likely been moved deeper into Russian territory, meaning the impact on the war may be “limited.” But that doesn’t mean the missiles have no utility. Storm Shadows, designed to penetrate deep into concrete, could be effective against military headquarters, or ammunition stores, many of which are still in range. ATACMS, some of which have cluster warheads, could be used to do significant damage to airfields. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think-tank in Washington DC, has calculated that 15 Russian airfields are in range of ATACMs (though it’s not clear how many aircraft are still housed on them).
George Barros, the author of that ISW research, agrees a less public debate may have been preferable, but if the very prospect of these permissions being granted has forced Russia to move aircraft further from the border, it’s a good thing. It could reduce the number of bombing missions Russian planes can make (known in the military as the “sortie rate”) and buy Ukraine valuable detection and reaction time for incoming attacks.
More importantly, he believes that if Ukraine could strike Russian troops, weaponry and logistics within the 300-kilometer range of the top-end ATACMS, it would for the first time force Russia to calculate the risks of moving large amounts of troops and equipment into Ukraine.
“You’ve only just now … started talking about a potential risk to Russia’s rear area and depriving them of this insane luxury that the Russian command has leveraged. To really bring mass (equipment), to get 10 to one artillery ratios on Ukraine at the frontline,” he told CNN.
Barros’ research has pinpointed at least 200 potential targets that would be in range of ATACMs, ranging from military regiments to fuel depots, weapons storage depots, and even the headquarters of Russia’s Southern Military district in Rostov (all of which would be much harder to move than aircraft).
The list is also conservative, Barros acknowledges, and has not accounted for new targets installed after the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. And some of the newest targets of all could, according to Savill, include Iranian FATH-360 ballistic missiles, which the US believes have already been supplied and have a range of just 75 kilometers (47 miles), far less than the Western missiles.
Experts also agree the missiles could provide valuable support to Ukraine’s drone and ground operations. Savill believes ATACMS could do serious damage to Russian air defense radars and systems, adding that “if you punch a hole through, actually Ukrainian long-range drones have got better options to penetrate deeper into Russia.” Hitting Russian air defense systems in the border areas could also improve Ukraine’s chances of retaking its own territory, said Barros.
“You actually do open up some interesting areas where there’s parts of occupying Ukraine that are no longer under Russia’s air defense umbrella,” he said.
There’s also the option in theory, Savill said, to extend the range of the missiles by launching from Ukrainian positions inside Kursk, though that could put Ukrainian bombers and missile launchers in the crosshairs of Russian air defenses.
Ultimately, Ukraine continues to argue that the ability to use Western-supplied long-range missiles inside Russia is part of the complex jigsaw puzzle of ending this war on Kyiv’s terms — and a way to show Russia it cannot outlast Ukraine’s allies.
Zelensky is heading to the US on the one hand buoyed by the Kursk offensive providing fresh evidence of both Ukrainian ingenuity and, he argues, the flimsiness of Russian “red lines,” but on the other hand motivated by the prospect of a third winter with critical electricity shortages, and still inadequate supplies of equipment and manpower.
“We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory,” he told a large gathering of Ukraine’s allies at the US’ Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany earlier this month, “so Russia is motivated to seek peace.”",['Clare Sebastian'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/politics/us-ukraine-military-aid/index.html,US expected to announce major Ukraine weapons package but delay shipments due to concerns over Pentagon stockpiles,2024-05-18 00:00:00,"The US is expected to announce a major weapons package to Ukraine as soon as next week, but it will likely delay the shipping of the equipment due to inventory shortages, according to two US officials.
The US currently has $5.9 billion left in Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine, the Pentagon said this week, which is set to expire at the end of the fiscal year in less than two weeks. That authority allows the Pentagon to pull inventories directly from American stockpiles to send to Ukraine, and it is how the US has supplied much of the arms and equipment it has provided to Kyiv.
The weapons package, which will likely include artillery, air defenses and other munitions critical to the fight, is expected to be significantly larger than recent announcements, which have hovered around $200 million for the last several months.
CNN reported earlier this week that the US was providing Ukraine with smaller military aid packages as the stockpiles of weapons and equipment that the Pentagon is willing to send Kyiv from its own inventory have dwindled. But faced with the possibility of the funds expiring, the US may now take a different approach, announcing large military aid packages that will take months to deliver.
The Defense Department has urged Congress to grant an extension on the use of the funds. But those prospects rapidly faded when the House of Representatives failed to pass a continuing resolution on Wednesday.
“There is every intention that we want to use every dollar and cent of that authority,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a press briefing Thursday.
Presidential drawdown packages were initially intended as a way of supplying Ukraine with arms and equipment in the short-term since the start of the war with Russia. Some packages began arriving in Ukraine within days of their announcement, allowing the US to quickly flow weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian military in the middle of war.
More sophisticated equipment with long production times was sent through another mechanism – the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative – that purchased weapons directly from arms manufacturers for future delivery.
Facing the prospect of billions in available drawdown authority expiring, the Biden administration has changed it from a short-term supply of weapons to a longer-term commitment, permitting the US to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine well into the next year at the current pace of deliveries.
The US believes Ukraine will need at least $500 million worth of presidential drawdown authority per month through fiscal year 2025, according to a senior administration official.
The US is also considering allocating $10 billion worth of revenues from seized Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine, which the G7 agreed to use toward Ukraine security assistance over the summer, according to the senior administration official.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the loan Friday in a post on X as part of her visit to Kyiv. “Relentless Russian attacks means Ukraine needs continued EU support,” she wrote, adding that the loan was part of “the G7 pledge.”
“We are now confident that we can deliver this loan to Ukraine very quickly,” she later said at a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, telling him: “You will decide how best to use the funds… And this will free more of your national resources to strengthen then, for example, your military capabilities and to defend yourself against the Russian aggression.”
The funds are expected to be delivered to Ukraine by the end of the year.
In June, the Group of Seven, which brings together some of the world’s largest economies, agreed to collectively loan about $50 billion to Ukraine, using the future windfall profits from Russian assets held in the EU and elsewhere as collateral.
Western nations froze Russia’s assets in bank accounts located in Europe, the United States and other countries as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Around two-thirds of Russia’s frozen assets, or some €210 billion ($234 billion), sits in the EU, while just $3 billion is located in US banks.
The EU loan still requires approval by the European Parliament and a qualified majority of the bloc’s member states.
“In view of the urgency of the proposal, the Commission will be working … to ensure a swift adoption,” the European Commission said in a press release.
The announcement sends “a clear signal that the burden of rebuilding Ukraine will be shouldered by those responsible for its destruction,” it added.
The funding mechanism stops short of seizing the frozen Russian assets outright. The EU has been worried that such a move would discourage other countries from keeping their assets in the bloc.

Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with missiles and drones since its full-scale invasion in February 2022, but its bombardments have intensified recently, leaving the country in a precarious position as colder weather approaches.
“Ukraine’s energy system has made it through the past two winters thanks to the resilience, courage and ingenuity of its people and strong solidarity from its international partners,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement Thursday.
“But this winter will be, by far, its sternest test yet.”
Last month, Russia launched one of its largest aerial attacks on Ukraine since the start of the war, firing more than 200 missiles and drones mainly at energy infrastructure. The onslaught caused power outages in several Ukrainian cities, affecting millions of households. Ukraine has also attacked Russia’s energy infrastructure.
Even before that attack by Moscow, more than two-thirds of Ukraine’s pre-war power generation capacity was offline because it had been destroyed, damaged or occupied by Russian forces, the IEA said in a report.
That has made rolling blackouts, which can also affect water supply, a feature of daily life in Ukraine.
“The situation could become even more dire as the days get shorter and colder,” the agency cautioned. “A yawning gap between available electricity supply and peak demand risks emerging — bringing the threat of even more severe disruptions to hospitals, schools and other key institutions in the depths of winter.”
The IEA estimates that Ukraine’s electricity supply shortfall could reach as much as 6 gigawatts this winter, or almost a third of expected peak demand and equivalent to the peak annual demand of Denmark, for example.
In its report, the agency outlines 10 measures that Ukraine and its allies should implement to tackle risks to the country’s energy supply. These include bolstering the physical and cyber security of critical energy infrastructure, expediting delivery of equipment and spare parts for repairs, investing in energy efficiency and increasing the capacity to import electricity and natural gas from the European Union.
But, according to the report, effective air defense is “by far the most important” measure to safeguard the minimum level of energy services in Ukraine through the coming months.
Help from frozen Russian assets
To help Ukraine through the upcoming winter, the EU will disburse €160 million ($179 million) — including €60 million ($67 million) in humanitarian aid for shelters and heaters, and €100 million ($112 million) for repair works and renewable energy, with the larger amount flowing from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets.
“It is only right that Russia pays for the destruction it caused,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. She also noted that the EU had contributed at least €2 billion ($2.2 billion) toward Ukraine’s energy system since Russia’s full-scale invasion began.
Work currently underway to repair Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and connect its electricity grid to the rest of Europe will cover more than 25% of the country’s energy needs this winter, according to the president of the EU’s executive arm.
In one example of such efforts, a thermal power plant in Lithuania is being dismantled and shipped to Ukraine where it will be reassembled. The EU has also dispatched solar panels to 21 hospitals in the country, eight of which will be “fully equipped” by the winter, she said.",['Hanna Ziady'],en

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said.
Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday.
Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.”
NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.
Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning showed huge plumes of smoke rising up from several depot buildings, as well as extensive damage to the buildings and nearby forest.
Fires continue to burn, as seen in the Maxar Technologies images.
Russian state news agency TASS reported that a drone attack had been launched on the city of Toropets overnight causing a fire “due to the fall of debris,” without specifically mentioning any targeting of a weapons facility.
Videos circulating on social media, verified by CNN, showed loud detonations and multiple buildings in the depot complex on fire.
Affected residents, including 11 children, have already been evacuated to the settlements of Kunya and Velikiye Luki in the neighbouring Pskov region, TASS said. No civilians are thought to have been injured in the drone attack, the news agency reported, citing Rudenya.
“Now we are engaged in evacuating the population, residents, maintaining public order,” Rudenya said in a later video statement, stressing that multiple emergency service units were involved in the response.
Rudenya made the call to evacuate so emergency services at the scene could work fully to bring the blazes under control, the local government said in a post on its official Telegram channel.
The Ukrainian security source told CNN that attacks of this nature are being used “methodically” to reduce Russia’s missile potential, adding that plans for further attacks on “similar” Russian military facilities are “proceeding.”

“Thanks to all who got concerned. Thanks to Ukrainian diplomats for the efficient support. And respect to Polish Police for conducting their obligations with no regards to height, weight, reach and regalia,” he wrote on X on Tuesday.
Usyk’s wife Yekaterina posted on her Instagram Stories: “Thanks God it’s all fine. No one was arrested. Usyk is free. A misunderstanding.”
It is currently unclear why Usyk was initially detained. A video on social media shows the heavyweight champion being escorted by law enforcement through what appears to be an airport in handcuffs.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Sybiha said the incident was “disproportionate” and “unacceptable” in a post on X.

Usyk’s wife Yekaterina posted on her Instagram Stories: “Thanks God it’s all fine. No one was arrested. Usyk is free. A misunderstanding.”
It is currently unclear why Usyk was initially detained. A video on social media shows the heavyweight champion being escorted by law enforcement through what appears to be an airport in handcuffs.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Sybiha said the incident was “disproportionate” and “unacceptable” in a post on X.
“We’ll send a relevant note to the Polish side,” he added.
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Usyk has used his platform to raise awareness and money for those impacted by the war in his home country.
He has since set up the Usyk Foundation, a charity fund which aids the country’s forces.
Earlier this year, Usyk beat Tyson Fury in a razor-thin split decision to become the undisputed heavyweight world champion.
He became the first undisputed champion since Lennox Lewis 25 years ago, with the Briton winning all three belts available at that time.",['Ben Church'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/europe/ukraine-russia-pow-execution-sword-intl/index.html,Kyiv investigates alleged Russian execution of Ukrainian soldier with sword inscribed “for Kursk”,2024-09-17 19:58:25,"Ukrainian prosecutors have launched an investigation into an alleged Russian execution of a Ukrainian soldier found dead with a sword inscribed with “for Kursk” in his body, in an apparent act of revenge for Kyiv’s recent incursion into the Russian border region.
In a photo circulating online, a man is seen lying on his back on a rubble-strewn road with a medieval-style sword protruding from his chest. Duct tape can be seen around the wrists of one of his blood-stained arms.
The words “for Kursk” are written in Cyrillic on the sword, in seeming reference to Ukraine’s cross-border attack on the Kursk region, the first foreign invasion of Russian territory since World War II.
Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said on Tuesday that the image showed “another act of barbarism” by Russia. His office later confirmed it had opened a criminal investigation into the alleged execution.
“Footage of an alleged execution by sword of an unarmed Ukrainian serviceman with taped hands is spreading on the web,” he wrote on X. “Russia continues its deliberate policy of eliminating everything Ukrainian, demonstrating worldwide its brutal cruelty and cynically disregarding any values and norms of the civilized world.”
Kostin said preliminary assessments showed the incident occurred in Novohrodivka, a city in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.
The image was later geolocated by Benjamin Strick, Investigations Director at the Centre for Information Resilience. CNN has independently verified this location.
Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Dmytro Lubinets, said the alleged execution was “a violation of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.” Under this convention, prisoners of war must not be subjected to torture and must be protected from violence.
Kyiv is investigating nearly 130,000 war crimes allegedly committed by Moscow since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Kostin said in June.
Ukrainian officials recently told CNN that apparent executions have become more common this year. Video obtained exclusively by CNN, filmed during fighting late August near the city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, shows an apparent execution by Russian troops of three surrendering Ukrainians, after their trench was overrun.
Thursday’s image comes as Russia is stepping up its efforts to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the start of Russia’s counteroffensive and said the Kremlin intends to deploy up to 70,000 troops to the region, but said last week that Moscow’s forces “have not yet had any serious success.”
Meanwhile, Russia is inching forward toward Pokrovsk, northwest of Novohrodivka, where the alleged sword execution occurred.
In an update Thursday, Ukraine’s military said its troops had thwarted 40 Russian attacks near Pokrovsk over the past 24 hours, and that the attacks were most fierce near Hrodivka and Novohrodivka.
The Kremlin has not commented on the alleged execution.","['Christian Edwards', 'Gianluca Mezzofiore', 'Kostyantyn Hak']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/us-reducing-military-aid-packages-ukraine/index.html,US military aid packages to Ukraine shrink amid concerns over Pentagon stockpiles,2024-09-17 05:00:19,"US military aid packages for Ukraine have been smaller in recent months, as the stockpiles of weapons and equipment that the Pentagon is willing to send Kyiv from its own inventory have dwindled. The shift comes amid concerns about US military readiness being impacted as US arms manufacturers play catchup to the huge demand created by the war against Russia.
The shortage means the Biden administration still has $6 billion in funds available to arm and equip Ukraine, but the Pentagon lacks the inventory it is willing to deliver more than two years into the war, two US officials told CNN.
“It’s about the stockpiles we have on our shelves, what [the Ukrainians] are asking for, and whether we can meet those requests with what we currently have” without impacting readiness, one of the officials said.
The Pentagon has asked Congress for more time to spend that money before it expires at the end of September, according to Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. It’s a stark reversal from last winter, when the administration was pleading with lawmakers for additional funding to support Ukraine against Russia’s invasion.
“Replenishment is also an issue,” the official said. The US is ramping up production of key items, such as 155 mm ammunition and Patriot missile systems, both to supply Ukraine and to refill US inventories. But it is a yearslong process that won’t quickly meet the surging demand.
Before the war in Ukraine, the US produced approximately 15,000 155 mm artillery shells each month. With new factories and production lines opening, the US is now producing 40,000 shells a month. But it will still take more than a year for the Pentagon to hit its goal of 100,000 shells each month. The process of ramping up production is on schedule, but the process will take years, requiring new facilities, expanded factories and Congress willing to allocate the money.
Ukraine is feeling the impact of the inventory shortages, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. During a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany this month, Zelensky told the US and other allies that deliveries of promised air defense systems were moving too slowly and warned of a “significant” shortfall in vital aid.
In April, Congress gave the Biden administration an additional $13.4 billion to use specifically to send Ukraine weapons and equipment drawn from US stockpiles. But the Defense Department hasn’t been able to use it all because of a lack of corresponding supply that it is willing to part with without risking the US’ own readiness, officials told CNN.
The Pentagon announced in April that it would send up to $1 billion worth of weapons and equipment directly from US stockpiles to Kyiv after Congress finally passed a supplemental funding package for Ukraine.
Since then, however, the value of each military aid package to Ukraine has been significantly smaller, with none exceeding $400 million and most in the $125 million to $250 million range. In 2022 and 2023, the Pentagon regularly announced packages worth between $600 million to $800 million, with the highest being $2.85 billion in January 2023.
Another US official noted the administration was unable to draw supplies from Defense Department stockpiles for the first four months of the year because of Congress’ delay in approving supplemental funding. The official also said the US is trying not to send Ukraine too much at once.
“There are limits to how quickly we can draw down equipment without impacting military readiness, which is one reason packages get spaced out,” the official said. There are also limits, the official added, to how quickly Ukraine can absorb the equipment and distribute it effectively.
The US is still trying to announce a new aid package roughly every two weeks, the official added, which Ukraine is “supportive of because they believe getting new packages every two weeks is a morale boost.”
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has vowed to continue providing military support to Ukraine and announced a new $250 million aid package at the meeting in Germany this month. Austin acknowledged at the meeting that the US is working to ramp up production and “speed up deliveries” to Ukraine.
“Time is of the essence, especially with winter on its way,” Austin said. “And we must all step up our support — and quickly.”","['Natasha Bertrand', 'Oren Liebermann']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/world/analysis-ryan-routh-ukraine-propaganda-russia-intl-latam/index.html,"Ryan Routh’s support for Ukraine is a propaganda win for Moscow, at a very tricky time for Kyiv",2024-09-16 00:00:00,"It is exactly the kind of attention Ukraine did not need. Since the start of clashes with Russia over its future in 2003, Ukraine has carefully avoided the sort of political violence Ryan Wesley Routh is accused of.
Yet now, at arguably the most crucial point of the conflict, Routh’s vocal support for Kyiv has somehow been seized upon by Russian echo chambers after he was detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump.
Someone like Routh was quite easy to meet in Ukraine in the opening months of Russia’s full-scale war in 2022. Border crossings and railway stations were often haunted by whispering, unshaven expatriates of questionable military provenance, trying to conjure the idea that the very real and painful struggle of Ukraine was something they had a pivotal role in. As the conflict has dragged on, the fantasists have faded, and the resumes of dozens of Western volunteers been vetted, or become less relevant as their alleged experience has been tested in combat. The most brutal fighting Europe has seen since the 1940s, the Ukrainian front line has never been less of a place for amateur thrill-seekers.
Yet Routh tried his best to associate himself with the fight against Russia, expressing support for Ukraine in dozens of X posts that year, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”
He protested in Kyiv after Russia invaded, and even tried to enlist, but, aged 56 with no military experience, was turned away. He tried to help recruit foreigners to fight but seems to have failed. The New York Times even interviewed him about a plan to obtain fake passports so Afghan veterans could come from Pakistan or Iran to Ukraine to help resist Russia’s onslaught. His offers to recruit large numbers to fight for Ukraine from across the world “were not realistic” said Oleksandr Shaguri, an officer of the Foreigners Coordination Department of the Land Forces Command. He told CNN, “The best way to describe [Routh’s] messages is – delusional ideas.” Routh never worked with them – a common refrain from across Ukraine’s military heard Monday.
Kyiv has enough on its plate now, other than explaining how little it had to do with the author of “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen – Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity.” This – Routh’s title for his self-published book – does not demand its author’s ideas are taken too seriously.
But already, Moscow’s prolific echo chambers have begun to fashion a narrative in which US support for Ukraine is somehow extremist. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, asked what he thought about the assassination bid, said, according to Reuters: “It is not us who should be thinking, it is the US intelligence services who should be thinking. In any case, playing with fire has its consequences.”
RT.com, a Kremlin-run English news outlet, also highlighted Routh’s interest in Ukraine, writing that “Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene stated that if the suspect’s identity is confirmed, it is clear he is ‘obsessed with the Ukraine war, which is funded by the US.’”
Do not expect any majorly new or intelligent arguments to surface about the war in Ukraine in the weeks ahead. But instead, anticipate a slow drip of some new voices, and some of the usual, suggesting the war in Ukraine cannot be won, that Putin must be given a chance to negotiate a deal (even one that lets him keep the chunk of Ukraine he has stolen), and that there is an unhealthy infection of extremists in the ranks of those who feel they must – as Routh once said – “fight and die” for Ukraine.
None of this helps Ukrainians who genuinely must fight and die to protect their homes and families. It particularly hampers Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, days before he is set to present a victory plan to the Biden administration. The clamor of support for Ukraine to receive US permission to fire longer-range US-supplied missiles at targets deeper inside Russian territory had been growing. It seemed likely last week that President Joe Biden would follow the course he’s taken when past decisions on arming Ukraine were presented to him, and consent – albeit very, very late – after public pressure from allies.
But now Zelensky’s press appearances may be dogged by questions about Routh, however absurdly distant from Kyiv’s agenda his apparent attack on a Florida golf course was. It will feed into the ultimate paranoia of US isolationists: that actions overseas which appear to benefit America’s global interests carry with them the risk of fomenting violence back home.
Routh’s political leanings and worldview were far from consistent, if not delusional. But in the breathy forum of random gibberish that is social media, they contribute to a narrative, for those who seek it, of support for Ukraine causing chaos in America. That the United States should just stay out of Putin’s war.
None of it connects with the savage reality Ukrainians face every night, shaken awake by Russian missiles, or losing loved ones to the ghastly attrition of the front lines.
Washington’s support for Kyiv is weighty and consequential when it lumbers into play, yet horrifyingly fragile when subjected to US electoral politics and the Republican party’s fickle grip on geopolitics. The sudden insertion of a wayward extremist like Routh is a loud, confusing wild card, at a time when support for Ukraine urgently needed a calm and balanced voice.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-troop-boost-intl/index.html,Russia-Ukraine war: Putin orders Russia to boost size of army,2024-05-09 00:00:00,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the country’s military to increase its number of troops by 180,000, the third time he has expanded its ranks since launching his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The increase would take the overall number of Russian military personnel to nearly 2.4 million, including 1.5 million troops, according to the decree published by the Kremlin Monday. The new staffing will come into effect in December, it said.
Putin’s decree comes after Ukraine last month launched a lightning attack across the border on Russia’s southern Kursk region – the first foreign invasion of Russian territory since World War II. Last week, Russia stepped up its efforts to expel Ukrainian troops from Kursk and is inching forward toward the crucial Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk in the eastern Donbas region.
Since 2022, Putin has ordered two previous expansions in the number of combat troops, in addition to a mobilization of military reservists and conscripts.
In August 2022, Putin ordered an increase of 137,000 troops by the start of the new year, which put the military’s staffing at just over 2 million personnel, including 1.15 million troops.
The next month, after a sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive that liberated most of the eastern Kharkiv region, Putin ordered the immediate “partial mobilization” of Russian citizens. The mobilization meant citizens with military experience were subject to conscription and that military reservists could be called up.
The mobilization prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the country – many to neighboring Georgia and other formerly communist countries near Russia’s border – and sparked angry demonstrations, particularly in Russia’s ethnic minority regions that have borne the brunt of previous recruitment drives.
The mobilization was suspended in November 2023 after officials said the target of recruiting 300,000 personnel had been met.
Then in December, Putin ordered another official expansion of 170,000 troops, bringing the total to 1.32 million.
Russia’s casualty numbers remain shrouded in secrecy. In September 2022, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said 5,937 troops had been killed in the war. The ministry has not published an update since.
Ukrainian and Western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. In an update published this month, the General Staff of Ukraine’s military said Russia has lost 616,300 troops. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense also estimates that Russia has suffered more than 610,000 casualties.
“Russia’s casualty rate will likely continue to average above 1,000 a day throughout September 2024 as Russia continues operations on a wide front from Kursk in the north to Robotyne in the south,” it said.","['Christian Edwards', 'Anna Chernova']",en

Three of those who were injured when a guided aerial bomb hit the 12-story building were children, the head of the Kharkiv city military administration Oleh Syniehubov said.
At least 14 people have been hospitalized as a result of the strike and one person has been reported missing.
“There may be people under the rubble,” Syniehubov said. “The search and rescue operation continues.”
One of the residents refused to evacuate without his dog, Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said. “Every life is important to our rescuers, so they rescued both the man and his pet from the smoke-filled apartment on the 12th floor,” he added.
Video shared online by the minister showed the dog being lifted in the air by one of the emergency cranes before reaching the roof of the building and being received by one of the rescuers.
The strike sparked a fire on the ninth floor. Three apartments were completely destroyed. Dozens of cars have been damaged from the strike, which also left hundreds of windows shattered.
“Residents are being evacuated. Specialized, humanitarian, international and Ukrainian organizations are responding to the scene,” Syniehubov said.
“This is civil infrastructure,” the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets said. “Russia massively violates human rights and international humanitarian law. The reaction must be here and now.”
Kharkiv lies near the border with Russia and has seen frequent attacks since the full-scale Russian invasion began in 2022.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his call for more military support from allies following the attack.
“The world must help us defend ourselves against Russian military aircraft and the dozens of guided aerial bombs that claim Ukrainian lives every day,” Zelensky said in a social media post on Sunday.
“This terror can be stopped. But to stop it, the fear of making strong, objectively necessary decisions must be overcome. Only decisiveness can bring a just end to this war. It is decisiveness that most effectively protects against terror,” he said.
Ukrainian authorities earlier put the toll from Russian strikes over a 24-hour period at nine, including a man and a woman in their 60s killed in Odesa.
Zelensky said that over the past week “the Russians have launched around 30 missiles of various types, more than 800 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 300 strike drones against Ukraine.”",['Radina Gigova'],en

Ukraine launched its assault last month, capturing scores of settlements, a move that stunned even Kyiv’s allies. But from the beginning observers have said it was unlikely that it would be able to hold on to its gains.
Geolocated video shows that Russian units have retaken a couple of villages, but the situation remains fluid. Both the quality and number of Russian troops committed to the region are hazy, and reliable frontline accounts are few and far between.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged the start of Russia’s counteoffensive and says it intends to deploy 60,000 – 70,000 troops in the Kursk region. But he said Friday that the Russians “have not yet had any serious success. Our heroic soldiers are holding on.”
The US has assessed that Russia would need up to 20 brigades – about 50,000 men – to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk, but Defense Department spokesman Major Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that Russian actions so far were “marginal” and analysts have not seen the sort of mass or quality that would quickly drive out the much smaller Ukrainian force.
Some high-caliber units do appear to be involved in the Russian counter-offensive geolocated video showed elements of the elite 51st Airborne Regiment involved in an assault on Thursday. But the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assesses that little of the Russian grouping in Kursk “is comprised of combat experienced units.”
Initial indications are that Russian forces may try to cut off Ukrainian troops near the town of Korenevo before beginning a larger-scale counteroffensive operation.
A Ukrainian officer taking part in the Kursk operation told CNN Friday that the Russians had taken about two kilometers (an assessment shared by Russian military bloggers) on the western edge of the zone seized by the Ukrainians last month. The officer said poor communications were hampering their operations.
Video surfaced of the Russian flag – and incidentally, the flag of the Wagner private military company – being raised in the village of Snahost. But the officer said the situation had stabilized and there was fierce fighting in another nearby village.
There are also signs that Ukrainian units may be developing a new assault route into a different part of Kursk, near the town of Veseloe. This might be intended to distract Russian forces.
“By launching surprise offensives across the thinly defended border, Ukraine can pursue operational-level guerrilla warfare to support an overall strategy of exhaustion,” says Robert Rose of the Modern War Institute at West Point.
Despite the gathering Russian counterattack in Kursk, and mounting Ukrainian losses, Zelensky insists the incursion into Kursk is necessary and valuable, and has slowed Russian advances in eastern Donetsk, where the city of Pokrovsk is under immediate threat. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is seeking to fully capture four eastern Ukrainian regions he already partly controls, and most of the fighting in the war has focused on this area.
Zelensky told a panel in Kyiv Friday moderated by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that Russia’s advantage in artillery ammunition in the Pokrovsk area had been cut from 12-to-1 to 2.5-to-1, which he attributed to the success of the Kursk campaign.
“The speed [of the Russian advance] in the Donetsk sector was even faster before the Kursk operation. And not only in Donetsk [sector], but in the whole of the east,” Zelensky said.
While Russian momentum slowed in the first week of September, no significant units were withdrawn to fight in Kursk, although some were redeployed from less contested areas along the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) front line. The Kremlin appears to prioritize the goal of progress in Donetsk over retrieving lost Russian territory – for now.
The Ukrainians have offered several reasons for the Kursk operation – that it would force Russia to redeploy troops currently committed on the front-lines in Ukraine; that it would provide Ukraine with land to trade in any negotiations; that it would make a mockery of Putin’s ‘red lines’; and that it would provide a pool of prisoners-of-war to exchange (which it already has.)
Zelensky claims that the Kursk operation has shown Putin’s warnings about the consequences of escalation to be hollow.
Zelensky has now added another justification for the Kursk offensive: that it forestalled a Russian plan to take a large swathe of northern Ukraine as a buffer zone, a plan that would have swallowed “regional centers.”
He told the Kyiv panel that “information from our partners” indicated that the Russians intended to create “security zones” deep inside Ukraine.
The ISW, a think-tank in Washington DC, said Friday that the Russian military command may have intended “additional offensive operations along a wider and more continuous front in northeastern Ukraine to significantly stretch Ukrainian forces.”
For now, such Russian ambitions are on hold. They still hold the advantage in firepower and men along most of the existing frontlines and will continue to use the tactic of intense bombardment - followed by infantry advances through the ruins of what has been destroyed - as a way of grinding down the enemy.
The Ukrainians have several immediate priorities: creating and strengthening defensive lines in the east and accelerating the formation of new units. They are developing longer-range strike capabilities to degrade Russian infrastructure such as airfields and fuel depots. And they are demanding greater freedom to use precision western missiles in strikes deep inside Russian territory.
Zelensky told Fareed Zakaria Friday that Russia’s guided aerial bombs, known as FABs, were responsible for 80% of destroyed infrastructure – and Ukraine urgently needed to hit the airfields from which they are launched.
This appeal appears to be gaining traction. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at his meeting Friday with US President Joe Biden that “the next few weeks and months could be crucial – very, very important that we support Ukraine in this vital war of freedom.”
But the Biden Administration is wary of the consequences of what the Kremlin sees as an escalation that would bring NATO directly into the conflict.
The Kursk incursion may encourage Ukraine to develop another tool that “could fundamentally change Ukraine’s approach to fighting,” according to Rose at the Modern War Institute.
“Ukraine cannot use manoeuvre to achieve a decisive victory over Russia. What it can do is use manoeuvre to exploit vulnerabilities, force Russia to over-extend, create chaos, encircle Russian forces, and capture Russian equipment.”
The crux, according to Matthew Schmidt, University of New Haven Associate Professor of National Security, is how Ukraine changes Putin’s decision-making, whether in Kursk or by much deeper strikes inside Russia, or both.
“Does it make him negotiate? Does it cause him to pull back or pause in Donetsk?”
Kursk may have succeeded in persuading Biden and other western allies to approve deeper strikes, Schmidt says - and “If follow-on attacks can sustain the war deep inside Russia, so it affects Russians and then affects the Kremlin’s decision making.”
That would define it as a success. But we need to ask the bigger question, as the US eventually did in Iraq, says Schmidt. “How does this end?”",[],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/putin-warns-nato-missiles-hnk-latam-intl/index.html,"Russia will be ‘at war’ with NATO if Ukraine long-range missile restrictions lifted, Putin warns",2024-09-13 00:15:31,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned NATO alliance leaders that a move to lift restrictions on Ukraine’s use of longer-range Western missiles to strike deep inside his country would be considered an act of war.
“This will mean that NATO countries – the United States and European countries – are at war with Russia. And if this is the case, then, bearing in mind the change in the essence of the conflict, we will make appropriate decisions in response to the threats that will be posed to us,” Putin told reporters on Thursday.
Putin’s comments come as US and NATO allied partners appear increasingly open to the possibility of allowing Ukrainian forces to use Western-provided long-range weapons systems to strike at Russian military targets, something which Kyiv has openly pressed for as the war continues deep into its second year.
During a recent visit to Kyiv, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered the strongest suggestion yet the White House was considering lifting restrictions in line with a broader strategic shift among NATO partners.
“From day one, as you heard me say, we have adjusted and adapted as needs have changed, as the battlefield has changed, and I have no doubt that we’ll continue to do that as this evolves,” Blinken said, while speaking alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy.
The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, arrived in Washington Friday for talks with US President Joe Biden that are expected to center on the use of Western weapons against targets in Russia.
Although the US has adjusted its policy to allow limited cross-border strikes into Russia using US-provided weapons, US President Joe Biden has yet to approve the use of longer-range systems. US officials have previously expressed concerns that allowing Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia could escalate the conflict.
Before those discussions, Russia’s security service, the FSB, revoked the accreditation of six British diplomats in Moscow and accused them of spying, without providing evidence. Britain later said the expulsion occurred last month and called the accusations “completely baseless.”
Biden is facing pressure at home from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to ease the restrictions as Ukraine struggles to consolidate battlefield advances and risks being pinned back by Russian forces.
On Tuesday, the bipartisan congressional Ukraine caucus called on Biden to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with the long-range weapons.
A group of key House Republicans also wrote to the president this week ahead of Blinken’s Ukraine trip, echoing appeals from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to lift the restrictions.
But Putin on Thursday raised doubts as to whether Kyiv could carry out long-range strikes alone, saying “the Ukrainian army is not capable of using cutting-edge high-precision long-range systems supplied by the West” without NATO assistance in targeting.
The US military already does provide intelligence to Ukraine, and has previously assisted in the targeting, although not with the long-range systems currently being considered.
According to Center for a New American Security Senior Fellow Dr. Stacie Pettyjohn, there may also be other intelligence resources available to Ukrainian forces, including commercial satellite imagery, depending on the target.
In a Thursday news conference Blinken reiterated that, as part of continuing military assistance to Ukraine, the US provides intelligence to Ukrainian forces, but declined to answer whether the US would increase its intelligence sharing.
Asked about the concerns of escalation, Blinken said Wednesday that they are one factor, but “certainly not the only factor, and it’s not necessarily a dispositive factor.”
He also accused Russia of escalation with its acquisition of Iranian ballistic missiles.
“We’ve now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine, so if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,” said Blinken.
On Friday, United Nations spokesman Stéphane Dujarric warned of “increasing rhetoric” around nuclear weapons, after the Russian ambassador to the United Nations echoed Putin’s comments and invoked Russia’s nuclear capabilities. Speaking in the UN Security Council on Friday, Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya warned: “The facts are that NATO will be a direct party to hostilities against a nuclear power. I think you shouldn’t forget about this and think about the consequences.”
The US first provided Ukraine with long-range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, which have a maximum range of about 180 miles (290 kilometers), in October of 2023. Kyiv has long called on its Western backers to allow the use of weapons systems that would provide a longer reach inside Russian territory.
In an recent interview with CNN’s Alex Marquardt, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that airfields Russia uses to hit Ukrainian cities are within the range of deep strikes. To date, Ukraine has used its existing supply of long-range ATACMS to target high-value Russian assets in occupied Crimea, including air defenses, ammo depots and airfields.
If NATO countries move forward with authorizing the use of Western weapons for long-range strikes inside Russian territory, this technology could also be used to target close-range ballistic missile (CRBM) systems that arrived in-country from Iran in recent weeks, former US ambassador William Courtney, now an adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corporation, told CNN. With a range of just 75 miles, a US-made system like ATACMS “could hit anything at that distance and well beyond,” he told CNN.

Ahead of the meeting, US officials said they did not expect Biden would immediately sign-off on allowing US-provided Army Tactical Missile Systems — known as ATACMS — to be launched on targets inside Russia far from the Ukrainian border.
But like the US, the United Kingdom has sent its own long-range Storm Shadow missiles to Kyiv. Their use, along with use of similar weapons from France, is currently limited to within Ukraine, and any change will require US sign-off — a matter for discussion at Friday’s talks.
The president has long resisted calls from Ukrainian officials to ease restrictions on the weapons. But as the war grinds on, and as the US watches with growing concern as Iran supplies Russia with ballistic missiles, intensive discussions have been underway at the White House about a potential change.
“We’re working that out right now,” Biden said when questioned this week whether he would permit Western-provided long-range missiles to target military sites like airfields, missile launchers, fuel tanks and ammunition depots inside Russia. The New York Times, citing European officials, reported that Biden appears to be on the verge of clearing the way for Ukraine to use long-range missiles as long as it doesn’t use arms provided by the US.
Within the Biden administration, the debate has pitted some officials who support loosening the restrictions against others who appear more skeptical, wary both for the risk of escalation and the usefulness of such a move.
Some assessments show Russia has already moved its assets – particularly launch points for glide bombs, currently the biggest threat to Ukrainian troops in the Kursk border region – out of range of the long-range missiles.
On the eve of Biden’s meeting with the prime minister, US officials continued to insist that no change in policy was expected to be announced this week on Ukraine’s use of ATACMS. In light of growing public pressure to allow American-provided long-range missiles to be launched deeper into Russia, senior administration officials have stressed that the US does not believe that such a change would help change the overall course of the war.
And while US officials have had ongoing discussions about the use of long-range missiles by Ukraine with both their Ukrainian and UK counterparts, American officials said the topic was not poised to take up the majority of Friday’s Biden-Starmer meeting – despite high interest in the topic in recent days.
The two leaders were eager to discuss a “wealth of issues” as Starmer was beginning to get settled into the job, one US official said.
The National Security Council on Thursday declined to comment on whether Biden was preparing to give a thumbs-up to the use of the UK’s Storm Shadow missiles far inside Russian territory.
For Starmer, who was elected as part of his Labour Party’s landslide general election victory in early July, the meeting is an opportunity to further develop an important global relationship. He and Biden also met on the margins of a NATO summit in Washington over the summer.
That meeting took place one week after Starmer’s election as prime minister and two weeks before Biden would exit the race for re-election. Starmer, people familiar with the matter said, requested another face-to-face with Biden before he left office in a bid to forge ties between the two nations, with questions looming about what the special relationship could look like after November’s US election.
No announcements are expected to come out of the talks, people familiar with the matter said, and officials have said policy changes on the US weapons are not imminent.
Still, that the conversation over long-range weapons is happening at all is an indication of how stalled battlefield dynamics are causing western leaders to rethink their approach.
Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters Thursday that allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles to strike Russia is a matter of deciding whether NATO countries are going to become directly involved in the military conflict.
If Western nations decide to allow Ukraine to use their long-range weapons, Putin said: “This will mean that NATO countries – the United States and European countries – are at war with Russia.”
The top American and British diplomats traveled to Kyiv this week and heard renewed pleas from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to allow his military to fire long-range weapons on Russian military sites.
American officials argue they constantly reevaluate their approach based on battlefield conditions. Although the US has shifted its policy to allow limited cross-border strikes into Russia using US-provided weapons, the administration has yet to allow longer-range strikes.
Asked about the concerns of escalation, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that they are one factor, but “certainly not the only factor, and it’s not necessarily a dispositive factor.”
“From day one, as you heard me say, we have adjusted and adapted as needs have changed, as the battlefield has changed, and I have no doubt that we’ll continue to do that as this evolves,” Blinken said at a news conference in Kyiv with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy.
The revelation that Iran has been providing Russia with ballistic missiles has changed the debate over Ukraine’s capabilities, Lammy said.
Other top American officials have sounded more skeptical. Last week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pushed back on the notion that lifting the restrictions and hitting deeper into Russia is a silver bullet, saying that “there’s no one capability that will, in and of itself, be decisive in this campaign.”
“There are a lot of targets in Russia – a big country, obviously,” Austin said at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Friday. “And there’s a lot of capability that Ukraine has in terms of (unmanned aerial vehicles) and other things to address those targets.”
A US official said the administration views Ukraine’s long-range attacks on Crimea, and Russia’s naval fleet there, as a much more effective use of the ATACMS, and a strategy that has been yielding significant success in recent months.
The Defense Department has a limited stockpile of the long-range systems, the official said, so the US has been trying to persuade Ukraine to use them to the maximum effect possible rather than on disparate targets in Russia that the US considers to have little strategic value.
A separate US official said they expect Russia to continue to move assets out of reach of the long-range systems and noted that “several hundred” ATACMS have been transferred to Ukraine “and Ukraine has used most of them.”
Despite those reservations, a growing chorus of voices in Washington is calling for the restrictions to be lifted. Senior Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including its chairman Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, have said the restrictions should be eased in order to provide Ukraine a better chance of success.
“In light of Putin’s increasingly horrific attacks on civilian targets, it’s time to lift restrictions on the use of long-range US-provided weapons to allow Ukraine to reach high value Russian military targets,” Shaheen said.
Earlier in the week, the bipartisan congressional Ukraine caucus called on Biden to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with the long-range weapons.
“Unless these restrictions are lifted, Ukraine will continue to struggle to achieve victory in its fight to defend its sovereignty and its people. The Ukrainian people will continue to suffer unnecessary death, loss, and hardship as Russia capitalizes on this policy and escalates its bombardments across Ukraine,” the bipartisan lawmakers wrote.
A group of key House Republican also urged Biden to ease the restrictions in a letter on Monday. And in a separate open letter, 17 former national security officials, including former US ambassadors to Ukraine and top military commanders, called on Blinken and Lammy to “act with alacrity.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/world/ukraine-kursk-offensive-cost/index.html,Ukraine’s Kursk offensive was seen as a success but it had a cost,2024-08-11 00:00:00,"Vasyl was several miles deep in Russian territory when he heard the whizz of an approaching drone loaded with explosives. He had seconds to react. “It was very quick. We ran to the trees and then there was a bang a meter or two away from me,” the Ukrainian soldier said.
“I look down and I see I have pieces of it in my leg. I don’t know what’s happening, so I put a tourniquet on and try to get out,” Vasyl – callsign Bumblebee – told CNN in Sumy, the northern Ukrainian city where he is recovering from his injuries.
Kyiv launched its surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region last month, taking Moscow by surprise and quickly advancing some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the border. But the campaign slowed and, on Thursday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Russia had launched “counteroffensive actions.”
The Russian Ministry of Defense said Russian forces had “penetrated” into the Kursk region, capturing 10 settlements.
In the days leading up to this counter-attack, CNN spoke with 14 Ukrainian soldiers from five different units who were deployed to Kursk as part of the incursion. Four were wounded in the operation and are currently recovering in hospitals in Ukraine, while the other 10 are still conducting missions in Russia. They included infantrymen, members of a drone unit, armored vehicle drivers and sappers, or frontline combat engineers.
Most have asked to remain anonymous or be identified by their first name and callsign only, given the sensitive nature of the topic and security concerns.
All 14 said the Kursk counteroffensive was a difficult operation with casualty rates on par with other parts of the frontlines. They said it was getting tougher, five weeks in, and some even questioned the decision to launch the incursion at a time when Ukraine was struggling to defend key towns and cities in the east of the country.
“It will get more and more difficult. There will be more artillery fire, more soldiers, and there will be very big and difficult battles, but we must do everything we can that improves our position – Ukraine wants peace, but peace when we win, not when we lose,” Vasyl said.
“Russia is sending a lot of troops and artillery (to Kursk). We have a lot of guys who have been killed and we have a lot of destroyed hardware,” he added.
Ukrainian officials said Moscow has sent some 30,000 troops into the Kursk region. Two officers with knowledge of the situation said these reinforcements included soldiers from the now dissolved Wagner Private Military Company who the officers believed had been redeployed from West Africa.
The Wagner mercenaries were meant to be officially absorbed into the Russian military following the death of Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin last year. But the Ukrainian soldiers operating in Kursk said Wagner fighters were distinguishable from the rest of the Russian troops because they have much better equipment and are better trained than the regular soldiers.
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov also claimed shortly after the start of the incursion that the Chechen special forces unit Akhmat was in the area.
Dmytro, Vasyl’s commander who oversees the Ukrainian Nightingale battalion, told CNN his unit had also found Wagner flags and insignia in the area – something other soldiers also confirmed.
While Russia has managed to reclaim control of some small settlements in recent days, Ukraine still controls the vast majority of the territory it took over in the first days of the incursion, according to an assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitoring group.
‘Tactical achievement’
The Kursk operation has given the Ukrainians a huge morale boost, being Kyiv’s first big strategic gain since the liberation of Kherson in November 2022.
Nearly all of the soldiers CNN spoke with said that giving Russia a taste of its own medicine was worth the pain.
“It was a good feeling. Russia is one of the biggest countries by territory, by population, by the size of its military. And they have nuclear bombs. We don’t have a lot of people and we have been at war for 10 years, since Russia attacked us and occupied some parts of (the) Luhansk and Donetsk regions,” Vasyl said, referring to Moscow’s support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014, when Crimea was also illegally annexed by the Kremlin.
“And now we see that, even after (all) this time, we can attack (Russia’s) territory and say to all the world, ‘Don’t be scared. Be brave. Be strong and smart.’”
Dmytro, whose callsign is Kholod – or Cold in Ukrainian – gave a simple assessment: “F**k yes! That’s the feeling when I saw our tanks shooting at the Russian positions. They put their hands up, we took a lot of prisoners.”
In an exclusive interview with CNN last week, Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi gave what was the most detailed explanation yet of the rationale behind the incursion. He said its aim was to stop Russia from using Kursk as a launchpad for a new offensive, to divert Moscow’s forces from other areas, to create a “security zone” and prevent cross-border shelling of civilians, to take prisoners of war and – indeed – to boost the morale of Ukraine’s troops and the nation overall.
Zelensky, meanwhile, said that another goal of the operation was to show Kyiv’s Western allies that with the right support, its military can fight back and eventually win the war.
Ukraine has been under pressure on its eastern front for most of this year and is still struggling to recover from the huge setbacks caused by delays in the delivery of US military assistance last winter and in the spring.
The Kursk offensive, which came as a surprise even to some of Ukraine’s closest allies, was hailed by Western officials. On Saturday, CIA director Bill Burns called it “a significant tactical achievement.” “It has not only been a boost in Ukrainian morale. It has exposed some of the vulnerabilities of Putin’s Russia and of its military,” Burns said, speaking in London.
A big, tangible win was much needed, and welcomed, within Ukraine. But soldiers involved in the operation who spoke with CNN said it was a difficult undertaking.
One soldier, callsign Fin, said Russia’s fortifications were built very well, combining different types of defensive measures – for example by placing mines underneath the anti-tank obstacles known as dragon’s teeth.
His entire team – four men with years of experience – was completely exhausted, he said. They were among the first units to cross into Russia, tasked with demining and dismantling defenses before Ukrainian infantry and artillery units arrived there. They spent two weeks inside Kursk, working non-stop, catching a couple of hours of sleep here and there, always on alert.
There were many casualties, they said. One soldier pointed to his boots and said one could take “a lot of DNA samples” from them. “Ukrainian DNA, unfortunately,” he said.
Fin said that the fact that they were operating on foreign land, in an area they didn’t know, made their mission uniquely challenging. Most of the units taking part in the Kursk operation were redeployed from other parts of the frontline, from areas they have got to know extremely well over the past two and half years.
One crew member of an armored personnel carrier (APC) that was transporting Ukrainian infantry troops around the Kursk region told CNN his unit was sent there from Chasiv Yar, on the eastern frontline, where he could “drive blindfolded from one position to another.”
In Kursk, he and his crew got lost.
“We ended up going to (the Russian town of) Sudzha, where we had to wait for our commander to find us,” he said, adding poor visibility and the crew’s lack of knowledge of the terrain made navigation extremely difficult. Several units have told CNN that navigation and communication between units and their commanders were a major problem in Kursk.
With GPS and cellphone signals jammed, the Ukrainians have been relying on the Starlink internet service. But they are finding the service doesn’t work at all in certain parts of the Kursk region.
The APC crewmember said that these communication disruptions meant they couldn’t contact their commander for many hours.
The area has been experiencing drought for several months and the land is now very dry, which makes it even more challenging to move around in heavy vehicles that stir up the dust. The APC crew member and his commander spoke with CNN in northern Ukraine, where they were recuperating from injuries they said were sustained when two Ukrainian armored vehicles crashed into each other because of very poor visibility and no navigation signal.
If the line of control remains largely unchanged, the battle in the Kursk region could soon start to resemble parts of the frontline in eastern Ukraine, with both sides digging in and fighting hard for every inch of land.
One sapper said his unit’s mission in Kursk had changed dramatically recently. He spoke with CNN in a small village on the Ukrainian side of the border after coming back from a particularly grueling mission.
“If it was easy, you wouldn’t see the medical evacuation vehicles up and down the road,” one soldier told CNN while resting on the Ukrainian side of the border.
Just a few weeks ago, he and his team were removing Russian defenses and clearing minefields to enable Ukrainian infantry to advance deeper into Russia. Now, he said, they are doing the opposite: laying mines and preparing defenses aimed at stopping Russian troops from pushing back.
Control your fear
Like all the soldiers CNN spoke with, Vasyl and his commander, Kholod, had no idea they would end up going into Russia when they were redeployed to the Sumy region from Pokrovsk in the east.
“We all thought that the Russians were going to come here, because we didn’t have a lot of time. There was a meeting and my commander told me that we needed to be in Sumy in three days,” Kholod said.
“And then the day when it all started, I was in a meeting with other commanders and they showed me the map and told me what they are going to do, where they are going to drive, what they are going to ambush, and I understood we are going to Russia.”
Speaking to CNN, Vasyl said he didn’t think too much about the mission – or the fact he got injured in it – preferring to remain in the here-and-now.
“This is war. We are soldiers, and we must do all that we can to protect our country. This is part of a big plan and I haven’t questioned why I’m here.”
Sitting on a bench in Sumy, with his bandaged leg stretched out and an IV needle protruding from near his elbow, Vasyl said the frontline was swarming with explosive Russian drones on the day he was wounded. “Guys from another unit came by and I told them to be careful because it was like a drone slaughterhouse in there… and just that second, bang,” he said, adding a few expletives.
His mates told him he was lucky to survive. Kholod, who was one of the first to get to him after the blast, commended his calm demeanor after the attack.
Vasyl said that was just his nature. “The most important (thing) when you are very scared, is to be in control. If you can control your fear, everything will be all right,” he said.
The doctors told him it was too risky to remove some of the pieces of shrapnel.
“The doctor said that the pieces will stay in my body, they are too difficult to remove, it’s better if they stay. I say ‘OK , OK , you are the doctor,’” Vasyl told CNN, not batting an eyelid over the idea of living the rest of his life with remnants of Russian explosives stuck inside him.
“So what,” he added. “I’m not going to become a Russian from these pieces. It doesn’t work like with vampires!”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Kostya Gak']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/europe/ukraine-hospital-train-wounded-soldiers-intl/index.html,Ukraine: On board the lifesaving hospital train bringing injured soldiers to safety,2024-09-12 04:01:22,"Olga is running around the intensive care unit, constantly checking her patients’ oxygen levels, adjusting their medication and noting their vitals. She’s working fast, but even at her busiest, the nurse anesthetist doesn’t hesitate to pause to adjust a pillow or blanket, and make sure the injured soldiers in her care are as comfortable as possible amid the constant rocking and rumbling.
A sergeant in the Ukrainian military, she is attending to some of its sickest patients. It’s a busy job – and she is doing it on a speeding train.
CNN gained exclusive access to a medical evacuation train used by the Ukrainian army to transport the wounded from near the frontlines to hospitals around this large country. This infirmary on wheels – one of several crisscrossing the nation – is now a key part of Ukraine’s healthcare system, which has been highly depleted by two and half years of Russia’s brutal war. It is operating in complete secrecy, which is why CNN is not revealing its route or identifying its staff by their full names.
Most cities in eastern Ukraine are struggling to find enough hospital beds to accommodate the almost constant stream of casualties from the frontlines. But freeing up space requires that even the sickest patients, many of them unconscious, are transferred to far-flung places, often hundreds of miles away.
Long ambulance journeys are too risky for people in a critical condition, and flying a helicopter is too dangerous given Russia’s air superiority over Ukrainian skies.
The train is a lifesaver.
“We can do almost everything here. It’s a fully-fledged intensive care unit,” Oleksandr, who is a captain of the Ukrainian Medical Forces and the train’s chief resident, told CNN.
He explained that his field – combat medicine – mostly involves stabilizing and evacuating patients to safety, rather than carrying out treatment. His work on the train is just one part of a medical chain that starts the moment a soldier is wounded.
“The most difficult part is evacuation from the frontline,” he said. “Combat medics who work on the front are dying just like soldiers.”
Running an ICU unit on a moving train is a herculean task that involves dozens of people and presents a unique set of challenges.
Oleksandr said the vast majority of his patients, some 90%, have suffered multiple shrapnel injuries. Many have had amputations, and several are intubated, alive thanks to ventilators and other life-support machines. All have numbers written on their hands showing which car of the long evacuation train they need to travel on.
“We are very limited in our capabilities here… If something happens, I cannot call an outside consultant,” he said.
“There may be minor operations, to stop bleeding. We cannot perform abdominal… and chest surgeries. We have to be very careful when selecting the patients,” he added.
Yevgeniy was severely wounded in a drone attack just two days before he was selected for evacuation on the ICU unit of the train.
He suffered multiple shrapnel injuries. His head was bandaged and two huge scars on his chest and stomach were covered with fresh dressings. Breathing with the aid of an oxygen nasal cannula, Yevgeniy told CNN he was the lucky one, as the only survivor from the attack near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. He said he wasn’t going to tell his family about his injuries until he was feeling better.
Ukraine’s most important train
The railway hospital is an example of the kind of Ukrainian ingenuity that impressed the world in the early months of this conflict.
Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, the CEO of passenger operations at Ukrainian Railways, told CNN that Ukraine did not have any medical railcars when Russia launched its full-scale invasion on the country in February 2022.
“So what we saw is that the wounded soldiers were physically just forced through the windows (of regular trains). And we said something has to be done about that… and started retrofitting our regular railcars that in peaceful days would just bring tourists to the Carpathian Mountains,” he told CNN after overseeing the arrival of one of the medical trains.
To limit rocking, the vehicle travels at about 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour, which is about half the speed of a regular train. It also has priority over everyone else – including any special VIP trains carrying foreign dignitaries.
Even so, the ICU unit is constantly shaking. Every piece of equipment, every bed and every beeping machine needs to be anchored to the floor and the staff must take extra care when working on the patients.
Ambulance trains were first used during the Crimean War in the 1850s, but they have come a long way since then. The modern Ukrainian versions come equipped with ventilators, life support machines, ultrasound scanners and portable air conditioners that help maintain stable temperatures even on the hottest days.
Each carriage is a self-sustained unit powered by generators – an important safety feature given the frequent Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Pertsovskyi said.
But it is the little touches that make these trains truly special.
Children’s drawings and Ukrainian flags are on display in every car, offering some comfort to the bruised and battered passengers. The blind brackets on every window are shaped as a trident, the country’s national symbol, placed deliberately in the eyeline of soldiers lying in their beds.
A tale of two deployments
The train provides a small window into the brutal cost of war. Experienced warriors and new recruits are traveling together, united by injury and pain.
Sitting quietly on his bed Oleksandr looked tired even before the long journey began. He told CNN he was hurt in a Russian drone strike.
“They dropped a grenade. I was stunned. I have shrapnel in my hands, on my shoulders and on my back,” he said, adding that the blast wave damaged his hearing.
An electrician and a father of two, the 35-year-old was mobilized 18 months ago and was serving as an anti-tank gunner in an infantry battalion in the Donetsk region. In all that time, he has spent just 45 days away from the frontlines.
“Morale is high, but people are very tired,” he said with a blank stare, as the train kept chugging along.
“At this point you realize that everything depends not on you, but on God. Or on luck. When the bombs fall, there is not much you can do about it.”
It was a sobering assessment from a man with the callsign “Positive.”
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has long admitted that the military is struggling to replenish its ranks, leaving exhausted soldiers without a chance to rest.
At a news conference last month, Zelensky said this effort to recruit more soldiers was gathering steam. “Some rotations have started. I can’t call it fundamental rotations yet, to be honest. But it’s a start, and that’s very important,” he said.
The fatigue is affecting frontline morale. CNN recently spoke with multiple Ukrainian commanders and officers who said desertion and insubordination is becoming a growing problem, especially among new recruits.
Sitting just a few beds away from Oleksandr was Stanislav, who enlisted voluntarily just three months ago. He was also wounded by a drone that dropped into his trench, leaving him with a punctured lung, broken ribs and other injuries.
Yet Stanislav appeared in a completely different state of mind to Oleksandr. “After I was wounded, my spirits didn’t dim. I got more motivated,” he told CNN with a smile.
Wearing a sports jersey and shorts, he was adamant Ukraine would win the war, despite being outnumbered and outgunned by Russia.
“They use quantity, and we use quality,” he said.
The incredible price of war
Nearly nine hours into its journey, the hospital train finally pulled into a railway station in one of Ukraine’s cities. In the darkness of the night, a long line of ambulances was awaiting the patients. The train’s voyage was over, but their road to recovery was only starting. Some will likely never fully recover.
Olga, the ICU nurse, was getting ready to hand her patients over to the medics on the platform. Her job was done for the day.
She joined the military as a civilian nurse in 2015, a year after the conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine started in the eastern parts of the country, and Crimea was illegally annexed by the Kremlin. She enlisted in the military in 2016 and – except for a short break in 2022 – has served ever since.
After her shift ended, she told CNN that seeing critically ill patients coming from the frontlines is the toughest part of her job.
“But we have the opportunity to provide much-needed help to our defenders 24/7, and that’s the best part.”
When the ambulances departed and the train left the station, Pertsovskyi, the railway chief, was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. The medical train is thought to be a major target for Moscow and there have recently been several strikes targeting the vicinity of railway stations and other infrastructure.
Standing on the platform, just hours after he saw a train full of new recruits headed in the opposite direction, he reflected on the brutality of the conflict.
“In the morning, I see these kids who are saying goodbye to their dads who are heading towards the frontlines,” he said. “So, seeing those same guys coming back… unconscious or with amputations, it feels like the price of the war is incredible. It’s a conveyor belt.”","['Christiane Amanpour', 'Ivana Kottasová', 'Alex Platt']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/ukraine-strike-restrictions-biden-blinken/index.html,Pressure builds on Biden from within his own party to ease Ukraine strike restrictions,2024-09-11 16:08:31,"Pressure is building on President Joe Biden, including from within his own party, to loosen the restrictions on Ukraine’s use of US-provided weapons to strike deep inside Russia.
Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen on Wednesday became the latest senior lawmaker to call for the restrictions to be lifted, saying in a statement to CNN that “in light of Putin’s increasingly horrific attacks on civilian targets, it’s time to lift restrictions on the use of long-range U.S.-provided weapons to allow Ukraine to reach high value Russian military targets.”
“On the expectation that the Ukrainian government has demonstrated how these new authorities fit within its broader campaign strategy, I hope that the Biden Administration will swiftly grant these permissions to the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” the New Hampshire Democrat said.
An aide to the senator told CNN that they are hopeful that Shaheen’s public call for the restrictions to be lifted will be impactful as the administration weighs the option.
“As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Appropriations Committee and Armed Services Committee, the Senator’s voice on this issue lends itself to show that there is political cover for making this sort of announcement,” the aide explained.
Congress weighing in is “a really important element for the administration,” the aide noted. “They need to hear from Democrats and Republicans that they support this decision, because it does have implications also for the appropriators and authorizers.”
Democratic Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin released a statement earlier Wednesday calling for the restrictions to be eased, in light of “Vladimir Putin’s relentless attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure,” that he called “horrifying.”
“Given these escalating attacks, the time has come to ease restrictions on Ukrainian’s use of U.S.-provided weapons. Greater flexibility to target Russian military assets will degrade Moscow’s ability to harm the Ukrainian people. The United States must act swiftly to grant these permissions,” the Maryland Democrat wrote.
Cardin and Shaheen’s statements, released on the same day Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Kyiv, added to a growing chorus of those calling Biden to allow Kyiv to strike deep within Russia. The Ukrainian government, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly been making the appeal.
Blinken and Zelensky discussed the restrictions during their meeting in Kyiv Wednesday. Blinken told reporters he would share that discussion with Biden.
“From day one, as you heard me say, we have adjusted and adapted as needs have changed, as the battlefield has changed, and I have no doubt that we’ll continue to do that as this evolves,” Blinken said at a news conference in Kyiv with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy.
Although the US has shifted its policy to allow limited cross-border strikes into Russia using US-provided weapons, the administration has yet to allow longer-ranger strikes. Officials have expressed concern about the potential for escalation and have argued that any one capability will be decisive in the war. A US official told CNN Tuesday that US intelligence shows that Russia has moved a number of assets outside of the reach of long-range strikes.
Asked about the concerns of escalation, Blinken said Wednesday that they are one factor, but “certainly not the only factor, and it’s not necessarily a dispositive factor.”
He also accused Russia of escalation with its acquisition of Iranian ballistic missiles.
“We’ve now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine, so if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,” said Blinken.
Meanwhile, there is a growing chorus of voices in Washington calling for the restrictions to be lifted. On Tuesday, the bipartisan congressional Ukraine caucus called on Biden to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with the long-range weapons.
“Unless these restrictions are lifted, Ukraine will continue to struggle to achieve victory in its fight to defend its sovereignty and its people. The Ukrainian people will continue to suffer unnecessary death, loss, and hardship as Russia capitalizes on this policy and escalates its bombardments across Ukraine,” the bipartisan lawmakers wrote.
A group of key House Republican also urged Biden to ease the restrictions in a letter on Monday. In a separate open letter, 17 former national security officials, including former US ambassadors to Ukraine and top military commanders, called on Blinken and Lammy to “act with alacrity.”
“A change in policy cannot come soon enough,” they wrote.
On Tuesday, asked if the US will lift the restrictions, Biden answered, “we’re working that out right now.”
Two US officials later told CNN that the Biden administration is not anticipating any policy changes when it comes to lifting restrictions. Still, others have said that the debate over the matter is ongoing.
In Kyiv on Wednesday, Blinken vowed support for Ukraine’s victory as he sought to make the case that assistance for Kyiv will endure regardless of the outcome of the US election.
His comments stand in stark contrast to remarks from Donald Trump at Wednesday’s debate, where the former president repeatedly refused to say he was committed to Ukraine’s victory.
“The bottom line is this: we want Ukraine to win, and we’re fully committed to keep marshaling the support that it needs for its brave defenders and citizens to do just that,” the top US diplomat said at a news conference in Kyiv.
“Support for Ukraine will endure because it doesn’t depend on any one country, any one party, any one election,” Blinken added. He reiterated NATO’s commitment to Ukraine’s “irreversible path” to membership in the alliance.
Asked about Trump’s comments, Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, also downplayed them.
“We will, without a doubt, have a new president of the United States, but we believe in steadfast support from the US nation, the American nation. We believe strongly in bipartisan support, and we clearly believe, and we are convinced, that fair, comprehensive, sustainable peace in Ukraine is also a strategic interest for the United States of America,” he said via an interpreter.
Blinken announced significant new funding for Ukraine: “$325 million in new funding to help repair Ukraine’s energy and electric grid,” “$290 million in new humanitarian support to help provide vital services like safe drinking, water, food, shelter, medicine”; and “$102 million in additional funding in humanitarian demining.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/republicans-urge-biden-lift-restrictions-ukraine-targets-inside-russia/index.html,Senior Republicans urge Biden to lift restrictions on Ukraine hitting targets deep inside Russia,2024-09-10 20:40:57,"A group of key House Republicans have written to President Joe Biden urging him to lift the restrictions on the use of US-provided long-range weapons systems and allow Kyiv to strike targets deep inside Russia.
The letter, dated Monday, echoes repeated appeals from the Ukrainian government itself, including President Volodymyr Zelensky. It was sent ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to the Ukrainian capital Wednesday and as the Biden administration continues to assess Kyiv’s request to carry out strikes deeper inside Russia.
US officials expect Blinken, who traveled to Ukraine Wednesday with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, to gather information during his trip to Kyiv on how these longer-range strikes would factor into Ukraine’s broader battlefield strategy. The UK is also considering whether to allow Ukraine to strike deeper inside Russia with its own long-range system, the Storm Shadow.
Blinken said he expects the topic to be discussed when Biden and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer meet Friday in Washington.
“We’ll be listening intently to our Ukrainian partners. We’ll both be reporting back to the prime minister, to President Biden in the coming days. And I fully anticipate this is something they’ll take up when they meet on Friday,” the top US diplomat said in London Tuesday.
Asked later Tuesday if the US will lift the restrictions, Biden answered, “we’re working that out right now.”
Two US officials later told CNN that the Biden administration is not anticipating any policy changes when it comes to lifting restrictions.
“No change to policy,” one senior administration official said, adding that there is currently no openness to lifting restrictions. Another US official echoed this, saying despite the fact that American and Ukrainian officials discuss this issue with regularity, the administration is not anticipating policy changes on ATACMS.
The Republican lawmakers argue that the restrictions “have hampered Ukraine’s ability to defeat Russia’s war of aggression and have given the Kremlin’s forces a sanctuary from which it can attack Ukraine with impunity.”
“It is far past time the administration reverses course and lifts the remaining restrictions on Ukraine’s use of U.S.-provided weapons against legitimate military targets in Russia,” the lawmakers wrote.
The letter was signed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Michael Turner, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, House Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Thomas Kean, and Helsinki Commissioner Richard Hudson. It hits out at decisions from the “Biden-Harris administration,” but stands in contrast to sentiments from the Republican presidential and vice presidential contenders, who have suggested they could stem assistance to Ukraine if elected. Former President Donald Trump has also repeatedly vowed to bring an end to the war.
Last week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pushed back on the notion that lifting the restrictions and hitting deeper into Russia is a silver bullet, saying that “there’s no one capability that will, in and of itself, be decisive in this campaign.”
“There are a lot of targets in Russia — a big country, obviously,” Austin said at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Friday. “And there’s a lot of capability that Ukraine has in terms of (unmanned aerial vehicles) and other things to address those targets.”
A US official said “several hundred” ATACMS have been transferred to Ukraine “and Ukraine has used most of them.”
As with previous steps the US has taken to bolster Ukraine on the battlefield, there are concerns within the administration that allowing Ukraine to strike further inside Russia could escalate the conflict and cause Russia to further accuse the US of being a part of the war.
However, the Republican lawmakers argued that “the administration’s concerns about escalation have been consistently invalidated since Day One of the war.”
“Neither Ukraine’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Russia nor its military incursion into Russia’s Kursk region – the first foreign occupation of Russian territory since World War II – have triggered a Russian escalatory response,” they wrote.
Debate ongoing with administration
The debate on Ukraine’s request is ongoing and some US officials expect the administration to green-light the Ukrainian ask, while others said it is possible the ultimate answer will be no.
A Ukrainian lawmaker told CNN that they hope that the transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia will be enough to tip the scales and shift the administration’s position. The US official noted that they had been tracking the expected delivery of the missiles for months and the US has “been accounting for it.”
Still, in London on Tuesday, Blinken indicated a willingness to change the US posture on the topic, saying that the US has routinely showed a willingness to adapt and adjust support for Ukraine based on “battlefield conditions.”
One objective of the trip will be learning from Zelensky “exactly how the Ukrainians see their needs in this moment, toward what objectives, and what we can do to support those needs,” Blinken said.
US intelligence assesses that more than 90% of Russian aircraft launching glide bombs and firing missiles against Ukraine are based at airfields that are at least 300 km from Ukrainian-controlled territory, putting them outside of ATACMS range, the US official explained.
“We expect this number to continue to increase. For example, Russia recently relocated its glide bomb missions from two airfields, which were located closer to the front, father east to airfields that are outside of range of ATCMS,” the official said.
In their letter, the Republican lawmakers argued that “there remain numerous other legitimate military targets in range in Russian territory.”
“The Institute for the Study of War assesses that, excluding airfields, there are over 200 legitimate military targets within range of U.S.-provided weapons to include military bases, logistics nodes, fuel depots, ammunition warehouses, and command and control systems,” they wrote.
Last month, senior Ukrainians presented US officials with targets they would like to strike in Russia during a visit to Washington. US officials reviewed their lists but did not ultimately give the Ukrainians a decision.
The US also has a limited stock of ATACMS available to provide Ukraine without impacting US military readiness, and using the weapons to strike far inside Russia would deplete Ukraine’s stockpile of ATACMS that could be used for other parts of their military campaign such as inside Crimea.
But the Ukrainians say there are weapons productions facilities that would be within reach of the ATACMS inside Russia that are worthy military targets, a source familiar with the Ukrainians position told CNN.
These discussions come as Ukraine has shown a willingness to possibly engage with Russia to begin talks to end the war. While US officials do not expect any talks to begin in the coming months, some are wary of Ukrainians going to the table with Russia before they are in the best possible position to begin those talks.
“It’s going to be up to President Zelensky if and when he wants to negotiate an end to this war, certainly a negotiated end is the most likely outcome here, but when that happens, and under what conditions and circumstances that’s going to be up to President Zelensky,” John Kirby, spokesman for the US National Security Council, said on Tuesday. “The point that Secretary Blinken will make is that that we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that if and when he’s ready to make that decision, that he does so from the best possible position. And so that’s what, that’s what this trip is really about. It’s not arm twisting. It’s about learning.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/europe/pokrovsk-ukraine-prisoners-enlist-soldiers-intl-cmd/index.html,"From convict to combatant, Ukraine enlists prisoners to fight Russian forces",2024-09-11 04:01:19,"Lurking in the bushes near Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is a unit of men who have two things in common: The short amount of time they have served defending their nation and time spent behind bars.
The 15 infantry men of the 59th Brigade, part of the Shkval – or wind gust - battalion are former prisoners. Convicted of a variety of crimes, they see their service in defense of Ukraine as redemption and a chance at a new life without a criminal record.
The catch for prisoners is that they are contracted to the military until the end of the war. There is also a considerable financial incentive: Wages range from $500 to $4,000 per month, depending on time spent on the front line, according to the Ukrainian defense ministry.
CNN was granted exclusive access to these recently recruited prisoners last week, near the crucial Donbas town of Pokrovsk. The city has become a focal point in recent weeks as part of the nearly 600-mile line of contact that is desperately short of men, ammunition and ever encroaching better supplied and vast Russian forces.
Among the recruits is Vitaly, 41, a recovered addict and a father-of-five. He asked to be identified by first name only for security reasons.
Vitaly told CNN that he had served 10 years in prison for four different crimes, most recently for grievous bodily harm.
Perched on a tree stump, Vitaly mumbles: “My life was crazy. I grew up with bandits, as did all of our guys (in the unit).”
But by joining the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, he saw an opportunity.
“I need to turn the page of my life. My life was a mess. It’s better to be useful here, to be around brothers … and a completely different social circle,” he said.
He’s been in the trenches for three months following a short, 21-day training period. Vitaly has no regrets about his choice to join the army, but he said he was naive about what to expect.
“Life is hard here, it’s fun … but I didn’t think it would be this hard,” he said.
Life as an infantry soldier is particularly dangerous with casualties higher than other members of the military. Infantry soldiers are often exposed to Russian drone attacks and storming trenches as they traverse large expanses of land by foot.
Vitaly recalls a particularly brutal drone attack on a comrade.
“He was taken apart. It is so hard to watch… but what can you do? You can’t help. You need to leave them behind because half of the man is already gone,” he said.
In June, the defense ministry launched an initiative that gives prisoners the chance to serve in the army, in exchange for freedom after the war.
There are strict rules around recruiting prisoners into the army, however. Convicts who have committed rape or any kind of sexual violence are prohibited from joining. The majority of the ex-cons CNN met had been jailed for offenses such as robbery or grievous bodily harm.
The Shkval battalion told CNN that they’re making legal requests to allow prisoners who have committed murder to join their ranks, because they feel those inmates may possess the skills needed on the battlefield.
Vitaly is one of 4,650 convicts, including 31 women, who have been released and called up for military service, Ukraine’s defense ministry told CNN. In total, 5,764 had expressed a desire to serve. The ministry did not say how many were currently serving on the front lines
The convict-to-combat initiative as well as a conscription reform are an attempt to bolster the faltering ranks of Ukrainian soldiers after two-and-half years of grinding war. But people CNN spoke to along the front line hinted at problems with the program, including inconsistent and short training periods. Those difficulties, coupled with chronic manpower shortages, are stunting Ukraine’s ability to repel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, they said.
With life on the front line more challenging than many expected, Vitaly now wishes that he’d paid closer attention during his short training. He thinks it may have better prepared him for what was to come.
“We were stupid and didn’t take it seriously. We were not responsible; it was a mistake not to listen or pay attention,” he said.
Keeping the peace
Ensuring there is no disruption to the peace in the unit is Oleksandr, the company commander.
Vitaly’s company commander Oleksandr is no stranger to convicts. He left his position as a prison guard in February 2022, when the war began. Now, despite his protestations, he is back in his old job – but this time, on the battlefield.
“They see me as a former prison guard, as a brother-in-arms, as a commander, everyone here lives as one family,” Oleksandr, who also asked to be identified only by his first name, said of the soldiers, adding, “I am a psychologist, father, mother, everything.”
Along with the 15 prisoners already in his unit, he’s expecting a further 25 from the prison where he used to work.
Oleksandr said that many convicts, like Vitaly, signed up with the aim of reforming themselves.
“Many of them have families in front of whom they were ashamed of what they did. They have children who are told that their father is a convict. When he joins the armed forces, he is no longer a convict – but a hero,” Oleksandr said.
During CNN’s time with the brigade in Pokrovsk, we were approached by another officer who said that morale was dwindling as the best Western weapons had been diverted towards the Kursk incursion, troops were lacking motivation and both soft-skin and armored vehicles were dwindling, complicating logistics and evacuations. The officer, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, said that a few days earlier they’d refused to fight alongside troops from a new brigade of freshly drafted men, due to their low morale and motivation to fight.
Still, morale may be Ukraine’s only hope in Pokrovsk as Russian forces zero in on the town.
At sundown in the town, the streets empty and the artillery barrages begin.
Russian forces are only 8 kilometers (5 miles) away, according to a map dated September 10 from DeepState, a group that monitors the progress of Russian forces in Ukraine that has links to Ukraine’s security services.
Pokrovsk is a vital supply town for eastern Ukrainian forces fighting back the tides of Russian soldiers. Its capture would be a coup for Putin as he looks to take control of the entire region of Donetsk. It could result in a withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Chasiv Yar and the line of contact moving closer to the much larger cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.
Oleksandr is aware of the unenviable task of holding the Russians at bay, but thinks his troops have a skill that others don’t.
“The convict sub-culture is used to surviving. This means physical endurance, moral endurance, plus cunning, logical thinking, much higher than those of ordinary civilians.”","['Sebastian Shukla', 'Frederik Pleitgen']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/iran-sanctions-ukraine-russia-blinken/index.html,US imposes new sanctions on Iran’s main airline over Tehran supplying missiles to Russia,2024-09-10 13:02:59,"The United States imposed new sanctions on Iran’s main airline as three key European allies announced they will move to do the same in response to Tehran’s transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken previewed the move to impose sanctions on Iran Air earlier Tuesday calling Iran’s supply of the missiles to Moscow “a dramatic escalation.”
The foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and Germany on Tuesday jointly called the missile transfer “a direct threat to European security.”
In addition to moving towards sanctions, they also said their countries “will be taking immediate steps to cancel bilateral air services agreements with Iran.” That move will restrict Iran Air’s ability to fly into Europe and the UK.
“The E3 has privately and publicly been clear that we would take new and significant measures against Iran if the transfers took place,” they said in a joint statement, using “E3” in reference to their trio of countries.
Tuesday is not the first time the US has imposed sanctions on Iran Air and it is unclear whether the latest punitive measures will actually serve to deter Tehran. Still, the joint actions are intended to send a sharp rebuke of Iran’s ongoing support of Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Beyond the additional sanctions on Iran Air, the US also imposed sanctions on Russian and Iranian officials and companies involved in the weapons transfers. They also identified “four vessels as blocked property that are enabling Iran’s delivery of weapons components and weapons systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and close-range ballistic missiles (CRBMs), to Russia,” the Treasury Department said in a press release Tuesday.
Blinken said in a press conference earlier Tuesday that “in recent days” the US has “been sharing intelligence behind these findings, with our allies and partners and working together to ensure that there will be significant economic consequences for Tehran’s actions.”
“Anyone who proves assistance to Russia … is perpetuating the war, is perpetuating the conflict,” he added, noting that “we’ve warned Tehran publicly, we’ve warned Tehran privately, that taking this step would constitute a dramatic escalation.”
“Dozens of Russian military personnel have been trained in Iran to use the FATH-360 close-range ballistic missile system, which has a maximum range of 75 miles. Russia has now received shipments of these ballistic missiles and will likely use them within weeks in Ukraine,” Blinken said alongside his British counterpart, David Lammy. Blinken said he expected Russia would begin using the missiles against Ukraine in the coming weeks.
Blinken explained that Iranian missiles will give Russia an “additional capability” and “additional flexibility,” explaining that Russia will now be able to use their own arsenal to hit targets beyond the front lines while they use the short-range ballistic missiles from Iran to hit closer targets.
Iran has already provided Russia with hundreds of drones that Russian forces have used in their war against Ukraine, and Russia has been building a drone-manufacturing facility in country with Iran’s help, CNN has reported. Iran has also trained Russia on how to use the drones.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani “strongly condemned the unusual statement of the Foreign Ministers of England, France and Germany regarding the cancellation of bilateral agreements for the provision of air services with the Islamic Republic of Iran and the sanctioning of Iran Air under the pretext of allegedly interfering in the conflict in Ukraine,” in a statement on Tuesday.
“This action of the three European countries is the continuation of the hostile policy of the West and economic terrorism against the people of Iran, which will face the corresponding and proportionate action of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Kanani said. “As it was emphasized before, any claim that the Islamic Republic of Iran has sold ballistic missiles to the Russian Federation is completely baseless and false,” he added.
“It adds to their capacity, and it fuels the war,” Blinken said of the new Iranian missiles Russia now has. “Anyone who is providing assistance to Russia, whether it’s direct lethal assistance like Iran or North Korea, whether it’s assistance to their defense industrial base, like China, is perpetuating the war, is fueling the conflict.”
In return for the new missiles, Russia will provide Iran with technology “including on nuclear issues, as well as some space information,” Blinken said. He called the relationship a “two-way street.”
“As Iran’s destabilizing activity spread, so does Russia, sowing even greater insecurity in their regions and around the world. In recent days, we’ve been sharing intelligence behind these findings, with our allies and partners and working together to ensure that there will be significant economic consequences for Tehran’s actions,” Blinken said.
The new sanctions include additional measures on Iran Air, the national airline, Blinken said. “Anyone who proves assistance to Russia … is perpetuating the war, is perpetuating the conflict,” he added.
Lammy similarly called Iran’s actions “a troubling pattern” and “a significant escalation.”
Blinken and Lammy said they would make a joint visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, later this week. Lammy described it as the “first joint visit of this kind for well over a decade.”
CNN previously reported that the shipment of the Iranian missiles had arrived in Russia. Iranian officials have denied that they sent missiles to Russia.

Ukraine managed to shoot down 58 of the 67 Shahed drones launched by Russia, the Ukrainian Air Force said in a Telegram post on Saturday. The attack targeted multiple locations including the northeastern city of Sumy, the southern city of Kherson, the central region of Poltava and the capital of Kyiv.
The head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhii Popko, described it as “another massive drone attack” on the city, in a post on his Telegram channel.
At least one drone appeared to have been shot down over the Ukrainian parliament as pictures shared online by the parliament showed debris scattered outside the building’s entrance.
Kyiv’s air defenses managed to shoot down all of the Russian drones which began approaching the city at around 3am local time (8pET), Popko said, with none of the drones managing to reach their targets.
There were no hits to critical or residential infrastructure during the attack, the region’s military chief, Ruslan Kravchenko said in a separate Telegram post. No casualties have been reported from the attack either, which saw air raid sirens sound for over eight hours, Kravchenko added.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been lobbying strongly in recent days for further air defenses for Ukraine in the face of a barrage of Russian attacks across the country.
Addressing a forum in Italy on Friday, Zelensky highlighted how Russia has launched “missiles, attack drones, and heavy aircraft bombs” against Ukrainian cities and villages. “Big, small, it doesn’t matter for them,” he added.","['Niamh Kennedy', 'Maria Kostenko']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/europe/ukraine-military-morale-desertion-intl-cmd/index.html,Ukraine’s military is struggling with low morale and desertion,2024-09-08 04:01:19,"Dima never puts out a cigarette until he smokes it right down to the filter, risking burning his fingers to squeeze out one more drag. He spent years on the Ukrainian front lines. He knows the price of a good smoke.
As a battalion commander, Dima was in charge of around 800 men who fought in some of the fiercest, bloodiest battles of the war – most recently near Pokrovsk, the strategic eastern town that is now on the brink of falling to Russia.
But with most of his troops now dead or severely injured, Dima decided he’d had enough. He quit and took another job with the military – in an office in Kyiv.
Standing outside that office, chain smoking and drinking sweet coffee, he told CNN he just couldn’t handle watching his men die anymore.
Two and half years of Russia’s grinding offensive have decimated many Ukrainian units. Reinforcements are few and far between, leaving some soldiers exhausted and demoralized. The situation is particularly dire among infantry units near Pokrovsk and elsewhere on the eastern front line, where Ukraine is struggling to stop Russia’s creeping advances.
CNN spoke to six commanders and officers who are or were until recently fighting or supervising units in the area. All six said desertion and insubordination are becoming a widespread problem, especially among newly recruited soldiers.
Four of the six, including Dima, have asked for their names to be changed or withheld due to the sensitive nature of the topic and because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
“Not all mobilized soldiers are leaving their positions, but the majority are. When new guys come here, they see how difficult it is. They see a lot of enemy drones, artillery and mortars,” one unit commander currently fighting in Pokrovsk told CNN. He also asked to remain anonymous.
“They go to the positions once and if they survive, they never return. They either leave their positions, refuse to go into battle, or try to find a way to leave the army,” he added.
Unlike those who volunteered earlier in the war, many of the new recruits didn’t have a choice in entering the conflict. They were called up after Ukraine’s new mobilization law came into force in the spring and can’t leave legally until after the government introduces demobilization, unless they get special permission to do so.
Yet the discipline problems clearly began way before this. Ukraine went through an extremely difficult patch during last winter and spring. Months of delay in getting US military assistance into the country led to a critical ammunition shortage and a major slump in morale.
Multiple soldiers told CNN at the time that they would often find themselves in a good position, with a clear view of the approaching enemy and no artillery rounds to fire. Some spoke of feeling guilty for not being able to provide adequate cover for their infantry units.
“The days are long, they live in a dugout, on duty around the clock and if they can’t shoot, the Russians have an advantage, they hear them advancing and they know that if they had fired it wouldn’t have happened,” said Andryi Horetskyi, a Ukrainian military officer whose unit is now fighting in Chasiv Yar, another eastern frontline hot spot.
Serhiy Tsehotskiy, an officer with the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, told CNN the unit tries to rotate soldiers in and out every three to four days. But drones, which have only increased in number over the course of the war, can make that too dangerous, forcing soldiers to stay put for longer. “The record is 20 days,” he said.
As the battlefield situation deteriorated, an increasing number of troops started to give up. In just the first four months of 2024, prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against almost 19,000 soldiers who either abandoned their posts or deserted, according to the Ukrainian parliament. More than a million Ukrainians serve in the country’s defense and security forces, although this number includes everyone, including people working in offices far away from the front lines.
It’s a staggering and – most likely – incomplete number. Several commanders told CNN that many officers would not report desertion and unauthorized absences, hoping instead to convince troops to return voluntarily, without facing punishment.
This approach became so common that Ukraine changed the law to decriminalize desertion and absence without leave, if committed for the first time.
Horetskyi told CNN that this move made sense. “Threats will only make things worse. A smart commander will delay threats, or even avoid them,” he said.
Pokrovsk has become the epicenter of the fight for Ukraine’s east. Russian forces have been inching towards the city for months, but their advances have sped up in recent weeks as Ukrainian defenses begin to crumble.
‘Everything feels the same’
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear his goal is to gain control over the entirety of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions and taking over Pokrovsk, an important military and supply hub, would be a major step towards that objective.
It sits on a key road that connects it to other military cities in the area and a railroad that links it with Dnipro. The last major coking coal mine still under Kyiv’s control is also just to the west of the city, supplying coke to make steel – an indispensable wartime resource.
Ukrainian soldiers in the area paint a grim picture of the situation. Kyiv’s forces are clearly outnumbered and outgunned, with some commanders estimating there are 10 Russian soldiers to each Ukrainian.
But they also appear to be struggling with problems of their own making.
An officer from a brigade fighting in Pokrovsk, who asked for their name to be withheld for security reasons, told CNN that poor communication between different units is a major issue there.
There have even been cases of troops not disclosing the full battlefield picture to other units out of fear it would make them look bad, the officer said.
One battalion commander in northern Donetsk said his flank was recently left exposed to Russian attacks after soldiers from neighboring units abandoned their positions without reporting it.
The high number of different units that Kyiv has sent to the eastern front lines has caused communication problems, according to several rank-and-file soldiers who were until recently fighting in Pokrovsk.
One said it was not unheard of to have Ukrainian signal jammers affecting vital coordination and drone launches because units from different brigades didn’t communicate properly.
A group of sappers – or combat engineers – spoke to CNN near the border between Ukraine and Russia’s Kursk region, where they have been recently redeployed from just south of Pokrovsk.
Kyiv launched its surprise incursion into Kursk last month, taking Moscow by surprise and quickly advancing some 30 kilometers (19 miles) into Russian territory.
Ukraine’s leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, said one of the goals of the operation was to prevent further attacks on northern Ukraine, while also showing Kyiv’s Western allies that, with the right support, the Ukrainian military can fight back and eventually win the war.
The operation also gave a major boost to an exhausted nation. Ukraine has been on the backfoot for most of the past year, enduring relentless attacks, blackouts and heartbreaking losses.
But the sappers were not too sure about the strategy. Having just finished a long mission over the border, they were slumped around a table outside a closed restaurant near the frontier, waiting for their car to turn up.
Chain smoking and trying to stay awake, they questioned why they were sent to Kursk when the eastern front line is in disarray.
“It felt weird entering Russia, because in this war we were supposed to defend our soil and our country, and now we’re fighting on the other country’s territory,” one of them said. CNN is not disclosing their identities because they were not authorized to speak to the media and due to the sensitive nature of their words.
All four have been fighting for more than two-and-half years and theirs is a tough job. As sappers, they spend days on the front lines, clearing mine fields, preparing defenses and conducting controlled explosions. They can find themselves under attack, ahead of even the first line of infantry, dragging around some 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of kit and four anti-tank mines, each weighing about 10 kilograms (22 pounds).
Speaking to CNN, they appeared completely exhausted. They had no rest between their Pokrovsk mission and the one in Kursk.
“It depends on each commander. Some units receive rotations and have time off, while others are just fighting non-stop, the whole system is not very fair,” one of the soldiers said. Asked if the advances in Kursk gave them the same boost as the rest of the nation, they remained skeptical.
“After three years of this, war, everything feels the same,” one of the men told CNN.
‘Rotten approach’
Speaking to CNN on Thursday, Ukraine’s Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted low morale is still an issue and said raising it was “a very important part” of his job.
“The Kursk operation… significantly improved the morale of not only the military but the entire Ukrainian population,” he said.
He said he had been going to the front lines regularly to meet with the soldiers there and do what he could to make them feel better. “We understand each other no matter who I am talking to, whether it is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander or a battalion commander… I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience. The front line is my life,” he said.
And Horetskyi – an officer specially trained to provide moral and psychological support to troops – is part of the plan to boost morale.
During recent leave in Kyiv, Horetskyi told CNN that while his role has existed for a while, it consisted mostly of paperwork. Now he spends a lot more time with his unit, checking in, making sure they are not burning out. Not that his help is always appreciated.
“They have this idea that I’m a shrink that will make them take thousands of tests and then tell them they are sick, so I try to break down the barriers,” he said, adding that little distractions can prevent a downward spiral.
In the monotony of war, any break from the routine can help, he said. This can include a wash in a real shower, a haircut or going for a swim in a lake. “It’s such a little thing, but it gets them out of the routine for half a day, it makes them happy, and they can return to their positions a bit more relaxed,” Horetskyi explained.
Even officers with many years of experience are finding the situation in the east difficult.
Some, like Dima, are transferring to posts away from the front lines. He said his decision to leave the battlefield was mostly down to disagreements with a new commander.
That, too, is increasingly common, several officers told CNN.
The ranks of Dima’s battalion grew thinner and thinner, until the unit disappeared.
They never received enough reinforcements, Dima says, something he blames squarely on the government and its reluctance to recruit more people.
The battalion suffered painful losses in the past year, fighting on multiple front lines before being sent to Pokrovsk without any rest. Dima saw so many of his men killed and wounded, he became numb.
Yet he told CNN he is determined to go back to the front lines, but will make one change first.
“I’ve now made the decision that I will stop getting attached to people emotionally. It’s a rotten approach, but it’s the most sensible one,” he said.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Kostya Gak']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/07/europe/ukraine-thermite-dragon-drones-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,Dragon drones: Ukraine’s thermite innovation rains molten metal on Russian positions,2024-09-07 04:01:19,"Ukraine appears to be calling on a fleet of fire-spewing “dragon drones” in its war with Russian invaders, putting a modern twist on a munition used to horrific effect in both world wars.
A series of videos posted on social media, including on Telegram from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry on Wednesday, show the low-flying drones dropping torrents of fire – actually molten metal – onto Russian-held positions in tree lines.
The white-hot mixture of aluminum powder and iron oxide, called thermite, burns at temperatures up to 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 degrees Celsius). It can quickly burn off trees and vegetation giving cover to Russian troops, if not killing or disabling the troops outright.
As it falls from the drone, the thermite resembles the fire coming from the mouth of the mythical dragon, giving the drones their nickname.
“Strike Drones are our wings of vengeance, bringing fire straight from the sky!” a social media post from Ukraine’s 60th Mechanized Brigade said.
“They become a real threat to the enemy, burning his positions with an accuracy that no other weapon can achieve,” the post continued.
“When our ‘Vidar’ works – the Russian woman will never sleep,” it added. Vidar is the Norse god of vengeance.
Creating that kind of fear is likely the main effect of Ukraine’s thermite drones, according to Nicholas Drummond, a defense industry analyst specializing in land warfare and a former British Army officer.
“It is very nasty stuff. Using a drone to deliver it is quite innovative. But used in that way its effect will have been psychological more than physical,” Drummond told CNN.
“I understand that Ukraine only possesses a limited capacity to deliver a thermite effect, so this is a niche capability rather than new mainstream weapon,” he said.
But he acknowledges the terror thermite can create.
“I would not have liked to have been on the receiving end,” Drummond said.
Incendiary weapons in war
Thermite can easily burn through almost anything, including metal, so there’s little protection from it.
It was discovered by a German chemist is the 1890s and was originally used to weld railroad tracks.
But its military potency soon became apparent, with the Germans dropping it from zeppelins as bombs over Britain in World War I, according to a history from McGill University in Montreal.
Both Germany and the Allies used thermite aerial bombs in World War II, and they also utilized it to disable captured artillery pieces, putting thermite into the breech and melting the weapon shut from the inside.
According to Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), a British anti-war advocacy group, Ukraine has previously used thermite dropped from drones to permanently disable Russian tanks.
The thermite is dropped “directly through the hatches, where the intense heat quickly ignites and destroys everything inside,” an AOAV report says.
“This precision, combined with the drone’s ability to bypass traditional defenses, makes thermite bombs a highly effective tool in modern warfare,” it says.
Thermite is just one type of incendiary weapon, with others including napalm and white phosphorus.
The United Nations Office for Disarmament says incendiary weapons can cause massive destruction and environmental damage.
“The fires produced by the weapon itself or ignited by it are difficult to predict and to contain. Therefore, incendiary weapons are often described as ‘area weapons’ due to their impact over a broad area,” it says on its website.
The United States used napalm to burn much of Japan’s capital to the ground in World War II’s infamous Tokyo fire raids. US forces also used it extensively in Vietnam.
The US military has also used thermite in grenades, with the US Army’s Pine Bluff Arsenal producing the weapons from the 1960s through 2014 and then resuming production again in 2023.
What thermite does to humans
Under international law, thermite is not banned for military combat, but its use on civilian targets is prohibited because of the horrible effects it can have on the human body.
In a 2022 report on incendiary weapons, such as thermite, Human Rights Watch called them “notorious for their horrific human cost,” including inflicting fourth- or fifth-degree burns.
“They can cause damage to muscles, ligaments, tendons, nerves, blood vessels, and even bones,” HRW said.
Treatment can last months and require daily attention. If victims survive, they are left with physical and psychological scars, HRW said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow’s initial push into Ukraine was stopped far short of capturing the capital of Kyiv, and the sides have fought over much of the same territory for most of the war.
Ukraine’s forces, outnumbered and outgunned by Russia, have proven adept at innovating with small drones to hammer Moscow’s troops and equipment.
A Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory near Kursk in August surprised Putin and has boosted Ukrainian confidence that it can prevail in the war.
Kyiv has accused Russian forces of using unspecified incendiary munitions on civilian targets earlier in the war, including on a village outside of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, in May 2022.
CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh went through that village, Cherkaski Tyshky, shortly after a Russian attack and described a scene of “homes, fields, even the air itself, torched.”
Ukrainian officers also accused Russia of using incendiaries in attacks on the city of Bakhmut last year.
Those uses of incendiaries haven’t led to quick victory for Russia, and Drummond doesn’t think they are a battlefield game changer for Ukraine either.
“If Ukraine wants to achieve real impact, it needs sufficient mass to force a proper breakthrough as it has in Kursk. This is what victory looks like,” Drummond said.
But thermite does give Russian troops another reason to be fearful of Ukrainian drones, he said.
“We have seen instances where Russian forces attacked by multiple drones have deserted their positions. The more Ukraine can instill a fear of drones the better its chances of success,” he said.
“Thermite keeps up the pressure.”",['Brad Lendon'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/europe/video-russia-surrendering-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-intl-cmd/index.html,Video footage appears to show Russians killing surrendering Ukrainian soldiers,2024-09-05 00:00:00,"Editor’s Note: This story contains images and descriptions of violence that are graphic.
The troops emerge and stagger into the middle of the dusty track, then onto their knees, their hands placed on their heads. Seconds later, the Ukrainian drone footage shows, they lie face down, motionless, dust trailing nearby.
Video obtained exclusively by CNN, filmed during fighting late August near the embattled city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, shows an apparent execution by Russian troops of three surrendering Ukrainians, after their trench was overrun.
The incident, described by a Ukrainian official who asked for some details to be withheld to protect the identity of the unit, is part of a pattern of apparent executions, seemingly increasing in pace this year.
Ukrainian defense intelligence sources have given CNN a list of 15 cases since November, most supported by drone video or audio intercepts, in which they say surrendering Ukrainian troops were killed by the Russians on the front lines, rather than being taken prisoner.
Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, told CNN on Wednesday his office was investigating at least 28 such incidents since the start of the war.
Following the publication of CNN’s report, Kostin posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that prosecutors had also launched an investigation into the footage obtained by CNN from near Pokrovsk, as well as video of another suspected killing of a captured Ukrainian soldier that was distributed Friday on Telegram.
Ukrainian prosecutors said Friday they were now investigating “the possible execution of 73 Ukrainian prisoners of war by the Russian military.”
The footage from Pokrovsk region appears to reflect the relentlessly brutal tactics of the Russian military as they continue to advance in Ukraine’s east.
Moscow’s grind towards the Ukrainian strategic military hub of Pokrovsk has continued, despite Kyiv’s recent gains in the Russian border region of Kursk fueling hopes the Kremlin would be forced to divert troops to defend Russia’s own borders.
Ukrainian prosecutors told CNN they believe the alleged killings are war crimes and part of an orchestrated policy by the Kremlin. “If prisoners of war surrender, if they show that they surrender, if they are without weapons in their hands, then summary execution is a war crime,” Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, told CNN.
Kostin argued that such crimes had been committed in different areas of Ukraine, by a variety of units, giving Kyiv “an opportunity to claim that such policy could be (elevated) to crimes against humanity. This policy is orchestrated by Kremlin. It’s an order of specific commanders.”
The Russian Ministry of Defense has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment on the allegations.
The emergence of videos showing what appears to be a growing Russian tactic has presented a dilemma for Ukrainian commanders, who face the unenviable task of warning their troops and the world of Russian savagery, at the risk of sapping already drained Ukrainian morale.
The Ukrainian official who provided the Pokrovsk drone footage said their unit was aware of multiple similar cases on the front lines that had not been publicized or investigated.
Some recent cases have been made public, with one unit in Toretsk claiming on Telegram it had drone video, which it published Tuesday, of three Ukrainian troops emerging from a basement, their hands raised in surrender, and then being gunned down by Russian troops. Prosecutors in the Donetsk region said they had opened an investigation into the “violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder.”
Several Russian servicemen have been put on trial accused of such killings, including one in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region. Ukrainian prosecutors allege the Russian was a convict, released from his sentence for theft in November to serve in the Russian military’s 127th motorised rifle division. Prosecutors have released drone footage supporting their claim the Russian shot a Ukrainian soldier in January as he emerged, arms raised, from his trench near Priyutne and then knelt.
CNN has obtained another drone video, also from Zaporizhzhia region, showing how in May this year, near the heavily contested village of Robotyne, Russian troops told three Ukrainian soldiers to lie face down after their dugout was overrun. Ukraine’s defence intelligence has given CNN audio transcripts of intercepts of what it says was the order from a Russian commander, known as “Turk,” to his subordinate in the field, “Maloy,” to kill the prisoners.
TURK: ⁠Take them f**king down, f***king zero them, zero them.
MALOY: ⁠Got it, copy.
TURK:⁠ ⁠Once you zero them, report back.
The drone video shows how, once all three Ukrainians are out of the trench and lying face down, the Russians fire.
While Russian President Vladimir Putin is the subject of an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court over his role in an alleged scheme to forcibly deport Ukrainian children to Russia, Kyiv is aggressively pursuing claims of genocide against Moscow. Kostin, the prosecutor general, suggested the systematic nature of these alleged battlefield executions meant they could become part of the wider genocide case.
The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Dr. Morris Tidball-Binz, visited Ukraine in May at the invitation of Kyiv, in part to examine reports of extrajudicial killings in combat.
A UN investigative source told CNN some of the apparent executions of Ukrainian soldiers had been subject to their examination. “There are many. There is a pattern. It suggests complacency, if not orders to give no quarter,” the source said, referring to the practice of showing no mercy.
“The killings are war crimes individually,” the source said, “and together could amount to crimes against humanity.”","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Kosta Gak', 'Victoria Butenko', 'Muhammad Darwish']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/ramstein-austin-zelensky-ukraine-intl/index.html,Zelensky sounds alarm on air defense shortfall as US announces more military aid,2024-09-06 08:59:10,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged international allies on Friday to speed up deliveries of promised air defenses, warning of a “significant” shortfall in vital aid.
Speaking at Ramstein Air Base in Germany at the opening of the 24th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, Zelensky said the weapons systems were essential to hold back Russian forces.
“I will not speak openly now about the number of systems they have received — thank you so much again — but the number of air defense systems that have not yet been delivered is significant,” Zelensky said.
“This is what was agreed upon, and this is what has not been fully implemented. The world has enough air defense systems to ensure that Russian terror does not have results, and I urge you to be more active in this war with us in air defense.”
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking alongside Zelensky, said the Biden administration would announce another $250 million security assistance package for Ukraine. Since the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in June, he said, the US has committed more than $4 billion in new security assistance for Kyiv.
Among the capabilities expected to be included in the aid package are 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, and spare equipment parts, according to a defense official.
But Austin continued to resist Ukraine’s calls for approval to use long-range strike capability within Russia, telling reporters later on Friday that that there was “no one capability” that would be a game changer on the battlefield.
The UDCG have met regularly since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Zelensky’s in-person appearance added extra relevance to the latest gathering.
Austin said Zelensky and the Ukrainian people had “inspired the world.”
Friday’s meeting comes amid an increased push by Ukrainian leaders for the loosening of restrictions to use long-range weapons inside Russia. A week ago, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov presented a list of targets inside Russia to the Biden administration during a visit to Washington. Days later, Russia launched one of the deadliest single attacks since the beginning of the war, killing dozens of people and injuring more than 200 more in a strike on a military educational facility in central Ukraine.
Last month Zelensky said he would be attending the United Nations General Assembly in September, where he would meet President Joe Biden. He added that the success of his so-called “plan for victory” largely depends on the US.
But Austin said he did not discuss that plan with Zelensky when they spoke at Friday’s meeting. “We talked about a number of things, but that specific piece we didn’t discuss,” he told reporters.
Canadian Minister of National Defense Bill Blair said Friday that his country supports Ukraine’s request to use long-range weapons on military targets inside Russia.
“One of the things that President Zelensky and his ministers have made very clear to us is that they are suffering significant attacks from airbases and military installations located within Russia, that those attacks are aimed towards their cities, their citizenry, and their critical infrastructure,” Blair said.
“And in order to properly defend themselves they have asked for permission to use long range fire capabilities that are being provided by the UDCG… I believe very sincerely that that will enable them to do a better job of protecting themselves.”
And while the US has said that much of the high-value targets inside Russia, such as the aircraft launching glide bombs, are outside of the range of long-range weapons like ATACMS — which have been a primary request from Ukraine — Blair said Russia moving capabilities out of that range is a win in itself.
“By moving them [glide bombs] further back, it’s made them less effective and has decreased the vulnerability of Ukraine’s cities and critical infrastructure,” he said. “And so if the Russians are being responsive to that potential threat, then I think that could be a very positive thing as well if it makes the Ukrainians’ situation more defensible and safer.”
Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas also said that Lithuania supports the lifting of restrictions on long-range strike capabilities, and added that “many” other countries do as well, though he didn’t name them. He blamed “Russian propaganda” for concerns about escalating the fight in Russia if Ukraine were to get the approval to strike military targets in the country.
“They are using it as a deterrence for more support to Ukraine, so I would recommend not to be convinced by this Russian propaganda and to do what we need to do to support Ukraine as much as possible,” he said.
Austin noted that Kyiv was continuing to “seize the initiative on the battlefield,” a clear reference to Ukraine’s ongoing offensive in Russia’s Kursk region.
“The Kremlin’s army of aggression is now on the defensive on its own turf,” Austin said. “But we know that Putin’s malice runs deep. Moscow continues its offensive in the east of Ukraine, especially around Pokrovsk. And Putin is repositioning his troops in Kursk. And the Kremlin continues to bombard Ukraine’s cities and to target Ukraine’s cities and to target Ukraine civilians.”
“That’s an outrage,” he said. “But Ukraine refuses to bend.”
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius added that he is “a little bit disappointed too” that more air defense systems haven’t yet made their way to Ukraine.
“We agreed in Washington to deliver more Patriot systems, air defense systems of any kind,” he said, “and up until now they haven’t yet arrived in Kyiv.”
On the sidelines of the meeting in Ramstein, Pistorius said Germany will deliver an additional 12 self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine.",['Haley Britzky'],en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/ukraine-army-chief-kursk-incursion-exclusive-intl/index.html,Exclusive: Ukraine army chief reveals the strategy behind Kursk incursion,2024-09-05 17:00:31,"Russia had been planning to launch a new attack on Ukraine from the Kursk region before Kyiv’s surprise cross-border incursion, Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday.
In his first television interview since becoming military chief in February, the general told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that he believed the Kursk operation had been a success.
“It reduced the threat of an enemy offensive. We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy’s territory so that [the enemy] could feel what we feel every day,” Syrskyi said, in a rare interview that offered a candid assessment of the war.
Last month, Ukrainian forces stormed into Kursk in a cross-border incursion that caught even American officials by surprise. It signaled that, despite Russia’s advantage in terms of men and armor, its military has vulnerabilities.
In what is the most detailed explanation of the rationale behind the incursion, Syrskyi outlined the key objectives of the operation: to stop Russia from using Kursk as a launchpad for a new offensive, to divert Moscow’s forces from other areas, to create a security zone and prevent cross-border shelling of civilian objects, to take prisoners of war and to boost the morale of the Ukrainian troops and the nation overall.
Speaking to Amanpour at an undisclosed location near the frontline, the general, who took over as army chief in February, said Moscow moved tens of thousands of troops to Kursk, including some of its best airborne assault troops.
And while admitting that Ukraine was under immense pressure in the area around Pokrovsk, the strategic city that has for weeks been the epicenter of war in eastern Ukraine, Syrskyi said his troops have now managed to stall the Russian advances there.
“Over the last six days the enemy hasn’t advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk direction. In other words, our strategy is working.” he said.
“We’ve taken away their ability to maneuver and to deploy their reinforcement forces from other directions … and this weakening has definitely been felt in other areas. We note the amount of artillery shelling as well as the intensity of the offensive have decreased,” he said.
‘The frontline is my life’
Speaking to Amanpour just after inspecting the frontlines on Thursday, Syrskyi said that there’s no doubt that Ukraine is outgunned and outmanned as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression.
“The enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course, in personnel, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles,” he said.
But Syrskyi also said the fact that Russia has such a material advantage has forced Ukraine to become smarter and more efficient in the way it’s fighting the war.
“We cannot fight in the same way as they do, so we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures and also, to use technical superiority,” he said, highlighting Ukraine’s advanced drone program and other home-grown high-tech weaponry.
Syrskyi was named Ukraine’s commander in chief in February, after President Volodymyr Zelensky fired Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. He took over at a particularly difficult time for Ukraine.
The months-long delays in the delivery of US military assistance caused critical ammunition shortages.
At the same time, Ukraine was struggling to replenish its troops, exhausted and diminished after fighting Russia’s relentless offensive for two years.
Syrskyi said recruiting more soldiers was a priority. The Ukrainian government then passed a controversial mobilization law, requiring all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine’s military and to carry their registration documents on them at all times – an effort to make the recruitment process more transparent and fair.
Seven months later, the new recruits are arriving to the frontlines. But several commanders have told CNN that not all of the new soldiers are ready to fight and are routinely abandoning their positions.
Syrskyi admitted his troops are heading to the battlefield after receiving less training than he’d like them to.
“Of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best, so we train highly qualified professional military personnel,” he said. “At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible,” he added, explaining that new recruits get one month of basic military training followed by half a month to a full month of more specialized training before they are sent to fight.
Syrskyi told Amanpour that the delays in US military assistance did cause major setbacks on the battlefield and led to a slump in morale – something he admitted was still an issue.
He said he takes frequent trips to the frontlines and makes sure he spends time with his troops.
“We speak the same language … we understand each other no matter who I am talking to – whether this is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander, or a battalion commander,” he said.
“I have been in this war since 2014,” he said, referring to Russia’s incursion into the Donbas 10 years ago. “In other words, the frontline is my life. We understand each other, I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience,” he added.
Syrskyi ended the candid interview by thanking Ukraine’s Western allies for their support. Switching from Ukrainian to English, he said: “Together we are stronger. Together we can win.”",['Ivana Kottasová'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ukraine-foreign-minister-kuleba-resigns-intl-hnk/index.html,Ukraine’s foreign minister tenders resignation ahead of expected cabinet reshuffle as Russian missiles kill at least 7,2024-09-04 06:32:28,"Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba became the latest top official to tender his resignation on Wednesday, ahead of a major government reshuffle, as yet another wave of Russian attacks overnight killed at least seven people, including a child.
As Ukraine’s top diplomat, Kuleba has been a prominent fixture in Zelensky’s administration and one of the most public-facing, especially dealing with overseas officials. He was seen as a capable politician and a safe pair of hands, one of the strongest members of Zelensky’s cabinet. His offer to resign comes ahead of an expected visit by the president to the United States this month.
Kuleba’s was the latest in a flurry of resignations. Two of Ukraine’s vice premiers, three ministers, the head of the State Property Fund and a top official in Zelensky’s Presidential Office have all quit within the last day or so.
The parliament approved Kuleba’s resignation on Thursday and Andrii Sybiha was sworn in as foreign minister to replace him. Sybiha has previously served as ambassador to Turkey and deputy head of the presidential office.
The resignations of the three other ministers and one of the vice premiers were approved on Wednesday.
Zelensky has not yet given any explanation for the reshuffle, but said in his nightly address on Tuesday that the coming fall will be “extremely important for Ukraine” and as such “our state institutions must be set up so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need.”
Kuleba and others who tendered their resignations are widely expected to be appointed into other roles in the Zelensky administration. The reshuffle comes at a precarious time for Ukraine. Its troops are under increasing pressure on the eastern frontlines, especially around the strategic city of Pokrovsk that is on the brink of falling to Russia.
It seems likely that Zelensky wants to have his new team in place for his trip to the US later this month, where he is expected to attend the United Nation General Assembly and meet the US President Joe Biden. Zelensky said last week that he intends to present Biden with a new four-part “victory plan” – without providing details.
The last major change Zelensky made to the top echelon of Ukraine’s leadership came in February, when he replaced the former Commander in Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi with Oleksander Syrskyi. Zaluzhnyi currently serves as Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Ukrainian political scientist Mykola Davydiuk said there were no major disagreements within the government. Instead, Zelensky is likely trying to send a signal that he is injecting new energy into his government.
“(The president’s office) wanted to do this last fall, then in December, then in May. They spoke about it so they need to do something, otherwise people will not believe them,” he said, adding that Zelensky likely sensed a window of opportunity for the reshuffle. “The West can’t criticize him now because they have a lot of domestic issues to deal with – the US election, election trouble in Germany and France,” he added.
Davyd Arakhamia, the majority leader of Ukraine’s parliament, said Tuesday that there would be major changes expected in the cabinet this week.
“As promised, a major government reset can be expected this week. More than 50% of the Cabinet of Ministers’ staff will be changed,” Arakhamia said on Telegram, adding that new members would be appointed imminently.
Among those who have resigned was the Minister for Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin, who was in charge of weapons production. He is expected to assume another defense role, Reuters reported.
The resignations also include the justice, environment and reintegration ministers.
“To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government… I am also counting on a slightly different weight for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy,” Arakhamia said.
Speaking to CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour Tuesday, Kuleba said he expects Putin to continue increasing air attacks on Ukraine before winter sets in.
“Putin still has the same purpose to freeze people, to destroy our economy and this is his strategy. So I’m afraid he will continue with his barrage of missile and drone attacks over the course of the autumn,” he said.
The attacks, Kuleba said, are “just another reason why delivery of air defense systems to Ukraine must be expedited.”
Missiles hit Lviv
The expected reshuffle came as Russian missiles continued to rain down on Ukrainian cities. Just a day after two ballistic missiles hit an educational facility in Poltava in central Ukraine, a major attack struck Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that has long been considered a safe haven in the war-torn country.
Lviv’s mayor Andriy Sadovyi said seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, were killed and 25 were injured in the attacks.
A 15-month-old child suffered “moderate” injuries and four other children have minor injuries, according to the head of the city’s regional military administration Maksym Kozytskyi.
Lviv, in Ukraine’s far west, is generally far away from Russian borders, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach it – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down. Many people from eastern regions relocated there to seek safety.
Kozytskyi said that at least seven “architectural monuments of local importance,” including houses located in a historic part of the city and inside a UNESCO buffer zone, were also damaged in the attack.
On Tuesday, a Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 54 people and injured nearly 300 others, according to the state emergency service of Ukraine. It was one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Ukraine’s Air Force said Wednesday it shot down 22 attack drones and seven cruise missiles.
At the same time, Ukraine is still reeling from a massive wave of attacks against the energy infrastructure last week. Power cuts are still impacting lives across Ukraine, with millions suffering from power cuts every day.
At least five people were killed and more than 10 wounded in Russian attacks in the central city of Kryvyi Rih after a hotel building was destroyed, according to the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration Serhiy Lysak.
The strike on Kryvyi Rih appears to be part of a wave of Russian attacks targeting hotels. Facilities in Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia, and another one in Kryvyi Rih were all hit by strikes in the past week or so.
Speaking about the attacks, Zelensky again appealed for Kyiv’s allies to supply Ukraine with more air defenses and to lift restrictions on the use of western weapons on targets in Russia.
Nuclear power plant worries
Meanwhile, the chief of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday.
Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that the situation at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe was “very fragile.” The Ukrainian energy company Energoatom said one of two power supply lines to the plant was damaged on Monday following Russian strikes in the region.
“Today we have one of the two existing power lines down, which means that the station is again on the verge of being on a blackout,” Grossi told reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday, before heading to Zaporizhzhia.
Explaining why a power cut could cause a serious accident at the plant, Grossi said: “Blackout, no power… No power, no cooling… No cooling, maybe you have a disaster.”

Of the five members of her family, only Yaroslav, Daryna’s father, is now alive, a lone survivor of a Russian strike on their home in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Wednesday.
According to eyewitnesses, Daryna, 18, her sisters Yaryna, 21, and Emilia, 7, and their 43-year-old mother Yevhenia were killed while sheltering in the staircase of their residential building, the Ukrainian emergency services said.
It is likely that Yaroslav survived only because he was in the family apartment when the missile hit the building. He popped over to grab some water for the family — it was him who went because the staircase was meant to be the safe place.
The deaths of the three sisters and their mother caused a huge outpouring of grief among people in Lviv and across Ukraine.
Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, said the eldest girl, Yaryna, worked in the town hall as part of the “Lviv - Youth Capital of Europe 2025” initiative.
Daryna, the middle sister, was a scholarship student of Ukrainian culture at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv. She had just began her second year.
“This is a great and irreparable loss. There are no words that can describe this grief. Let us pray for the souls of the innocent victims. Let us pray for Yaroslav, the father,” the university said in a statement.
Yevhenia, the mother, and the two older girls were members of the Ukrainian Scouts movement. In a statement, the Scouts described Yevhenia as a “creative, intelligent, positive and bright personality.”
Tragic week for Ukraine
The staircase where the Bazylevyches died was meant to be a safe place in a safe city.
Lviv lies in western Ukraine, near the border with Poland, and it has always been seen as one of the safest places in the country.
Tens of thousands of internally displaced people from eastern parts of Ukraine are living in Lviv. Russia is far away, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach the city – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down.
It has been an exceptionally deadly week for Ukraine — the four members of the Bazylevych family were among seven people killed in Lviv on Wednesday. On Tuesday, two Russian missiles hit a military educational facility in Poltava, killing 53 people and injuring more than 270 others.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Svitlana Vlasova']",en

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/ukraine-poltava-russia-attack-intl/index.html,"Poltava, Ukraine: Dozens killed in Russian strike on military educational facility",2024-09-03 11:39:38,"A Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 51 people and injured more than 200 others, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office, in one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said preliminary information indicated two ballistic missiles hit the facility in the city of Poltava and a nearby hospital on Tuesday morning.
“We say again and again to everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not somewhere in a warehouse,” Zelensky said in a statement.
The head of the Poltava region military administration, Filip Pronin, announced the latest death toll on Telegram, adding that that rescue crews continue to clear and search through the debris at the site. Pronin said authorities believe up to 18 more people may be under the rubble.
At least 10 residential buildings were also damaged in Poltava, he said.
Moscow has not commented on the attack, but a well-known Russian military blogger Vladimir Rogov reported earlier on Tuesday that Russia struck a military school in Poltava.
Speaking about the attack, President Zelensky repeated his call on Ukraine’s Western allies to supply Kyiv with more air defenses and lift restrictions on his country’s military using their weapons to strike inside Russia.
“Long-range strikes that can protect against Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,” he added.
‘We will never forget this’
Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the missile reached the target in a very short period of time. People were struck down as they were trying to get into the bomb shelter, officials said.
“The only way to intercept them was to have the Patriot system or a SAMP/T air defense system because they are the only one capable of intercepting ballistic missiles,” said Kuleba, who added that he originally came from the Poltava region.
Ukraine has received a handful of Patriot air defense systems from the United States and Germany, although Kyiv has consistently said the number was insufficient to allow it to effectively defend itself.
The Biden administration said in June it was prioritizing critical air defense capabilities for Ukraine over other countries to “ensure Ukraine’s survival.” But Kuleba made it clear on Tuesday that new weapons cannot come soon enough.
“I don’t know how many more tragedies like this have to occur for all promises to be fulfilled and for all new commitments to be made,” Kuleba added, reiterating Zelensky’s calls for more defense systems to be sent to Ukraine.
Local authorities said Tuesday was a “terrible day for Poltava” and declared three days of mourning. No more details would be released about the strike due to “security issues,” they said.
Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, described the attack as a “terrible tragedy for the whole of Ukraine,” as Western allies condemned the scale and force of the Russian strike.
“My deepest condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the Russian missile attack on Poltava,” Zelenska said. “Russia is taking away our most valuable asset – our lives. We will never forget this.”
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy paid tribute to those killed, in a post on X. “Russia’s strikes on Poltava are the latest sickening act of aggression in Putin’s abhorrent and illegal war in Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. “We stand with Ukraine.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/ukraine-big-drone-attack-russia-intl-hnk/index.html,Ukraine carries out one of its biggest-ever drone attacks on Russia,2024-09-02 05:11:46,"Ukraine launched one of its biggest-ever drone attacks on Russia over the weekend, hitting a refinery and power station deep inside the country, according to videos posted on social media and geolocated by CNN.
The short videos show plumes of smoke rising from targets in Moscow and the neighboring Tver region.
The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged the size of the Ukrainian attack, but downplayed its effectiveness, saying Sunday that 158 Ukrainian UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) “were destroyed and intercepted by on-duty air defense” overnight in 15 regions, including over the capital.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said two drones were shot down in the area of the Moscow Oil Refinery. No casualties were reported, but the second downed drone damaged a technical building at the refinery and caused a fire, which the mayor said had been localized and did not affect the plant’s operation.
The Tver region’s governor, Igor Rudenya, said on social media that a fire caused by the drone attack on the Konakovo district has been extinguished and that gas and electricity services to the area were operating normally.
The Ukrainian drone strikes follow others in the past week, including one last Thursday that set fire to oil reservoirs at a refinery in the Rostov region of Russia, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.
Social media video geolocated by CNN showed a large cloud of black smoke billowing from the Atlas oil depot in Rostov following the strike.
The recent wave of Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory began last month, when Kyiv’s troops launched a cross-border incursion into the Kursk region on August 6.
Just on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that “people are going through tough ordeals, especially in the Kursk region,” as Ukrainian forces attempt to “destabilize the situation along the border.” But the attack has not stifled Russia’s offensive in the eastern Donbas region, added Putin.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the Kursk offensive is going “according to plan,” but admitted “difficulty” in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk.
Zelensky said the most recent drone assaults deep inside Russia were justified by Moscow’s repeated attacks on his country.
“Just in the past week, Russia has launched over 160 missiles of various types, 780 guided aerial bombs, and 400 strike UAVs of different kinds against our people,” Zelensky said in a post on X.
On Monday, at least three people were wounded by strikes in Kyiv, as well as the eastern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, according to Ukrainian authorities. Those came after 41 people were injured following a Russian attack on civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, local authorities said.
“Russia is once again terrorizing Kharkiv, striking civilian infrastructure and the city itself,” Zelensky said on X, calling on allies to “give Ukraine everything it needs to defend itself.”
“It is entirely justified for Ukrainians to respond to Russian terror by any means necessary to stop it,” Zelensky said, reiterating his call for Western countries to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, which have that prevented their use to hit targets inside Russia.
“This includes decisions to carry out long-range strikes on Russia’s missile launch sites, destroy Russian military logistics, and conduct joint efforts to shoot down missiles and drones – everything that will help us resist Russian evil,” Zelensky said.
Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with missile and drone attacks since its invasion.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told CNN last week that he has presented the Biden administration with a list of targets inside Russia that Kyiv wants to hit with US-supplied long-range weapons, including the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).
Fired from mobile launchers, ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles) and can deploy single high-explosive warheads or up to 900 submunitions, according to the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also urged allies to “abandon baseless fears” and “lift restrictions on the country’s legitimate right to self-defense.”
“Ukraine is forced to fight with hands tied behind its back,” Kuleba said on Monday.
“We have explained what kind of capabilities we need to protect the citizens against the Russian terror that Russians are causing us, so I hope we were heard,” Umerov said in an interview with CNN’s Alex Marquardt.
But a US official said many of Ukraine’s high-value targets in Russia are outside the range of ATACMS. Russia’s military has pulled its high-value military assets far away from the front lines, including the aircraft launching glide bombs that have wreaked havoc on Ukrainian targets.
Umerov has pushed back on the assessments, saying Ukraine has presented the US a list of targets they would use ATACMS to strike.
An analysis last month from a Washington-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), supported Ukrainian claims there are high-value targets inside Russia within range of ATAMCS.
ISW said it had identified 233 Russian targets – “large military bases, communications stations, logistics centers, repair facilities, fuel depots, ammunition warehouses, and permanent headquarters” – in range of ATACMS that are immobile assets, meaning Moscow cannot move them out of harm’s way.
And ISW said Ukraine would only need to use ATACMS to strike some of those targets to have a significant impact on Russia’s ability to fight on the front lines.
While it pushes for the US to lift the ATACMS restrictions, Ukraine has been developing new longer-range indigenous weapons.
Zelensky announced last month that his country has a new jet-powered drone that can strike deep into Russia.
He said the Palianytsia “missile-drone” had been used in combat for the first time and was much faster and more powerful than the country’s existing fleet of drones, according to Ukrainian state media.
The Ukrainian president said he wouldn’t give any more specific details on the Palianytsia. But he hailed the new weapon’s “long-range” capabilities, hinting that it may surpass the up to 1,500-kilometer (932 miles) range of Ukraine’s current drone fleet.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/europe/russian-bomb-attack-kharkiv-intl/index.html,"Russian bomb attacks on Ukraine’s Kharkiv leave at least 8 dead, more than 100 injured",2024-08-30 00:00:00,"A day of mourning has been declared in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, following Russian bomb attacks that killed at least eight civilians, including a child in a playground.
Six people were killed and at least 97 people were injured, including 24 children, when Moscow struck the city with five guided aerial bombs on Friday, according to Ukrainian authorities, in one of the most impactful Russian attacks on the region over the summer. Among the dead was 14-year-old named Sofia, who was in a playground when she was killed, according to Ukrainian authorities.
On Saturday, a further two people were killed and at least 10 injured, including two children, when Russian forces struck the Cherkaska Lozova village, also in Kharkiv.
“These horrific, cowardly Russian strikes targeted ordinary homes and a city park. Russia will be held accountable for all its evil deeds,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the attack on Friday, again pressing Western allies to step up their military support.
“We need decisions – decisions that our partners can make, decisions from those countries that have the power to ensure we have the capability to destroy Russian military aircraft at their bases, where eliminating these terrorists and their aircraft will be most effective,” he said.
Russian forces conducted Friday’s “massive bombardment” of the city using Su-34 fight jets that were deployed from the border Belgorod region, according to the head of the Kharkiv regional prosecutor’s office, Oleksandr Filchakov.
The 500 kilogram (1,100 lb) guided aerial bombs were launched from Russian territory and are very difficult to intercept, according to Ukrainian officials.
“This is a bomb with a control module, which means that the enemy was specifically targeting residential infrastructure,” the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said Saturday.
Striking the airplanes that carry those bombs is the most effective way to prevent such attacks, Zelensky has argued, as he continues to urge the United States and Western partners to lift restrictions on using long-range weapons to hit military targets on Russian territory.
The guided aerial bombs hit civilian infrastructure in four districts of the city in the Friday afternoon attack, Filchakov said, adding that 82 apartment buildings, 11 private houses, three administrative buildings, two educational establishments, 47 shopping facilities, 57 cars, two warehouses, 10 garages and an enterprise facility were damaged.
In the strike Saturday, the Russian military used a guided FAB-500 bomb, which damaged about 20 houses, the regional prosecutor’s office said.
“A woman who was in the immediate epicenter of the explosion was killed, as well as her neighbor,” it said.
Meanwhile, civilian evacuations continue in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces aim to take control of the strategic town of Pokrovsk. The town serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military because of its easy access to Kostiantynivka, another military center. Ukraine uses the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties.
Over the last three days, 86 children have been evacuated from Kostiantynivka and nearby areas along with their parents as Russian shelling intensifies, regional officials said Saturday. There were nearly 2,130 children living in the community prior to the mandatory evacuation.
Children and their parents are being taken out by armored vehicles from settlements located less than 10 kilometers (about 6.2 miles) from the front line, according to Ukraine’s National Police.
“We didn’t even think about leaving. We didn’t want to leave what we have. We are leaving because of the children, to keep them safe,” one of the evacuated mothers said.
At least one person has been killed in Kostiantynivka and at least 11 injured over the past week, according to police.
Ukraine strikes Russia’s Belgorod
Meanwhile, Ukrainian attacks across the border into Russia continued on Saturday.
At least five people were killed and more than 50 injured across Russia’s Belgorod region over the last 24 hours, the regional governor said Saturday.
Most of the casualties occurred in the city of Belgorod, where three people were killed and 31 civilians, including three children, were injured. More than 20 people remained hospitalized on Saturday, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.
Civilian infrastructure across the region was damaged, he said.
Ukrainian attacks in Russia’s Kursk region also continued, Moscow said Saturday. Kyiv’s forces have made further advancements in their incursion into the border region, Ukraine’s army chief said Friday.
Kyiv’s troops have advanced up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) further in some areas over the past 24 hours, taking control of an additional 5 square kilometers of the territory, Ukraine’s top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said Friday.
In addition to the casualties in Kharkiv, Russian attacks on Ukrainian territory have killed at least three people and injured 16 over the past 24 hours, according to officials.
The Ukrainian Air Force said Saturday that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine overnight with an Iskander-M ballistic missile launched from Voronezh region, four S-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles launched from occupied parts of the Donetsk region, and 52 Shahed drones launched from Kursk region.",['Radina Gigova'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/30/world/deadly-russian-strike-kills-child-on-playground-ukrainian-officials-say/index.html,"Ukraine’s Zelensky fires Air Force chief, days after fatal F-16 crash",2024-08-30 00:00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fired his Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk on Friday, a day after the Air Force announced one of Ukraine’s top pilots had died when a US-made F-16 fighter jet crashed.
Zelensky said the command level of the Air Force needed to “strengthen,” but did not say whether his decision to sack Oleshchuk was related to the F-16 crash on Monday.
“I am infinitely grateful to all our military pilots, engineers, soldiers of mobile fire groups, air defense units. To everyone who really fights for Ukraine. And it is necessary also at the command level: We must strengthen. And protect people. Protect personnel. Take care of all our soldiers,” the Ukrainian leader said in his nightly address on Friday.
Lieutenant General Anatoliy Kryvonozhka will serve as acting Air Force commander, he said.
Ukraine’s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov denied that Oleshchuk’s firing was connected to the death of the pilot. “I would probably say this is a rotation,” said Umerov in an interview with CNN’s Alex Marquardt on “The Situation Room.”
“This is two separate issues… at this stage, I would not connect them,” he said, calling the pilot’s death “unfortunate” and that Ukraine is investigating what happened.
Ukraine’s air defenses have been under intense pressure, with Russia pummeling its neighbor with aerial assaults. F-16 pilot Oleksiy Mes, known as “Moonfish,” was killed in the crash while “repelling the biggest ever aerial attack” by Russia against Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian military source.
His death was a particularly hard blow for Ukraine; the first F-16s only arrived in the country earlier this month and Moonfish was one of the few pilots trained to fly them. The Ukrainian Defense Forces do not believe pilot error was behind the incident, the source added.
Earlier on Friday, Zelensky cited recent attacks to again press Western countries to step up their military support for Ukraine.
A deadly strike in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Friday “would not have happened if our Defense Forces had the ability to destroy Russian military aircraft where they are based. We need strong decisions from our partners to stop this terror,” he said.
“This is an absolutely fair need. And there is no rational reason to limit Ukraine’s defense. We need long-range capabilities.”
The Friday strike killed a child in a playground and left others dead in a residential building, Ukrainian authorities said. At least five people were killed and 28 wounded in the attack, according to local authorities.
“The occupiers killed a child right on the playground. A girl,” Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said, adding that others died in a burning high-rise building in the city’s industrial district. A gliding bomb also struck the city center, Terekhov said.
Moscow strikes as Kyiv advances
Moscow’s decision to ramp up strikes on Ukraine comes amid Kyiv’s continued push into Russian territory, an embarrassing assault for President Vladimir Putin.
Ukraine’s army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Friday that Kyiv’s forces have made further advances in their incursion into Russia’s western Kursk region, pushing up to two kilometers (about 1.2 miles) further into the border region over the past 24 hours.
Syrskyi relayed the information during a staff meeting, in which Zelensky added that the replenishment of the “exchange fund” of forces was “extremely important for strengthening our positions.”
The Ukrainian offensive and the Russian aerial response have distracted attention from the ground campaign in eastern Ukraine, but Syrskyi said fighting “of varying intensity” was continuing along the entire front line.
“The most difficult situation remains in the Pokrovsk sector. The enemy is trying to break through the defenses of our troops, but as of this morning all attacks have been repelled, the enemy has not succeeded,” he said.
Russian forces have been pushing hard to capture Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, even as Moscow struggles to contain the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region.
The front line has moved so close to Pokrovsk that the fighting was audible in the city center, according to a CNN team that reported from the town earlier this week.
Pokrovsk, a strategic target for Moscow, sits on a key supply road that connects the town with other military hubs, and forms the backbone of Ukrainian defenses in the part of Donetsk region that is still under Kyiv’s control.
Fierce fighting is also ongoing in the town of Karlivka, about 30 kilometers (or 18.6 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.
“Today the enemy is actively trying to enter Karlivka. The fighting is ongoing right now, there are many of them,” a serviceman of Ukraine’s 59th brigade told CNN on Friday. The Russian forces don’t have control over the town yet, he said, “but the situation is difficult. ”
Long-range weapons use
Speaking with CNN, Umerov said the Biden administration was still considering his request, repeated Friday in his meetings with administration officials including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, for the US to lift restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons to strike deeper inside Russian territory.
“We have explained what kind of capabilities we need to protect the citizens against the Russian terror that Russians are causing us, so I hope we were heard,” said Umerov.
Umerov pushed back against an assessment from a US official to CNN that many of Ukraine’s high value targets in Russia are outside the range of long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).
“We are showing that the airfields that they are using to hit our cities are within the range of deep strikes,” said Umerov.
Asked about whether Ukraine was aiming to trade the Russian territory it has captured in Kursk for territory Russia has captured in Ukraine, Umerov said Ukraine was more focused on the “capabilities” that territory allows them.
“We are focused to increase our capabilities to withstand, to repel the Russians from the temporary occupied territories,” said Umerov.","['Radina Gigova', 'Rob Picheta']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/30/americas/colombian-foreign-fighters-detained-russia-intl-latam/index.html,They vanished for weeks. Now Russia says it detained two Colombian men on suspicion of fighting for Ukraine,2024-08-31 04:01:02,"Russian authorities say they have detained two Colombian men suspected of fighting for the Ukrainian military – a shocking twist in the weeks-long case of their disappearance since mid-July.
The last time Cielo Imbachí heard from her husband was more than 40 days ago, while he was on a layover in the Venezuelan capital Caracas. At the time, Jose Aron Medina was on his way back to Colombia after spending around nine months in Ukraine, she says.
He never made it home.
On Friday, Medina and his friend, fellow Colombian Alexander Ante, appeared in a video released by the Russian Federal Security Service, which accused them both of “participating in hostilities on the side of Ukraine against the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as mercenaries.”
The Colombians were carrying “documents confirming their illegal activities,” said the FSB statement, and clothing with the insignia of the Ukrainian Carpathian Sich battalion.
State TV channel Russia 1 reported that Ante and Medina were in Venezuela when they were detained and extradited to Russia. Their detention in Moscow was ordered by the city’s Lefortovsky District Court on August 28 and they are being held until October 22, the court’s press service told state news agency TASS.
The two men’s detention and apparent extradition highlight the strong economic and military ties Russia has with Venezuela while also serving as a warning to foreign fighters, estimated to number in the thousands, who flocked to help Ukraine in the war effort.
Reached for comment by CNN, Ukraine’s International Legion said it does not provide any information about potential, current, future, or former servicemen. It said it is reaching out “to other units where Colombians are serving,” adding that the “whole story sounds weird and unlikely.”
In the meantime, Imbachí says she received no information from any of the countries involved.
“I still haven’t been able to speak with him: the last time I spoke with my husband was that fateful day, 18th of July… from then nothing. And we just saw the videos of him in a Moscow court,” Imbachí told CNN.
“Venezuela just took them and deported them to Russia, and we don’t understand the reason why they were deported,” she said.
Venezuela’s foreign minister did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
A Colombian government source told CNN its foreign ministry is waiting for official reports from the consulates in Caracas and Moscow to understand how best to assist the pair. The ministry also told CNN that it has requested and is awaiting more information from Moscow through diplomatic channels.
‘We are desperate’
Imbachí and Medina, 36, have a nine-year-old daughter and a son from her previous marriage. Both men, Medina and Ante, come from the western Colombian city of Popayán, and they live close to each other, she said.
Imbachí said her husband left for Ukraine last November, joining Ante who was already there. Medina decided to return home this July. She said he flew from Warsaw in Poland to Madrid, Spain, and then onwards to Venezuela. His destination was Popayán.
It remains unclear why the two men traveled through Venezuela, as there are several direct flight options between Spain and Colombia. Traveling through Venezuela is difficult due to sanctions imposed by the United States against the Latin American country.
Imbachí thinks her husband went via Caracas as it was the cheapest option. “Flights from Spain to Colombia are really expensive, while I think Venezuela was cheaper.” She does not know how they were planning to get from Caracas to Popayán.
A missing-person flyer from Colombia’s attorney general, with photos of the two men, said that their last known location was a Venezuelan airport on July 18 where they were seen “wearing camouflaged clothing from the Ukrainian Army.”
Imbachí and Colombian congressman Jose Uscategui went to the Venezuelan embassy in Colombia’s capital Bogota on July 26 to “make a formal request for the safe return of these individuals to their home,” according to a tweet from Uscategui.
CNN is attempting to contact Ante’s family.
Venezuela has grown closer to Russia over the last several years as Nicolas Maduro seeks Russia’s support to shore up his embattled presidency. The two countries have signed several bilateral agreements, including an extradition treaty.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/30/politics/umerov-ukraine-targets-cnntv/index.html,Ukrainian defense minister tells CNN ‘I hope we were heard’ after presenting list of targets inside Russia to US officials,2024-08-30 23:03:03,"Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told CNN the Biden administration is still considering his request to lift restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons to strike deeper inside Russian territory and confirmed he’d presented a list of targets in meetings with senior officials in Washington on Friday
“We have explained what kind of capabilities we need to protect the citizens against the Russian terror that Russians are causing us, so I hope we were heard,” Umerov said in an interview with CNN’s Alex Marquardt on “The Situation Room.”
Despite repeated requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the US is not currently expected to loosen restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).
“You’ve heard us say that the Ukrainians can use US security assistance to defend themselves from cross-border attacks, in other words counterfire. But as it relates to long-range strike, deep strikes into Russia, our policy has not changed,” said Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder on Tuesday.
Ukraine only has a limited supply of US-provided long-range missiles, and the US has made it clear that Kyiv should not expect another significant delivery of ATACMS because of the finite number in US inventories and the long production time of the weapon, according to a US official.
Speaking before the meeting between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Umerov, the US official said many of Ukraine’s high value targets in Russia are outside the range of ATACMS. Russia’s military has pulled its high value military assets far away from the front line, including the aircraft launching glide bombs that have wreaked havoc on Ukrainian targets.
But Umerov pushed back on such assessments, saying Ukraine has presented the US a list of targets they would use ATACMS to strike.
“We are showing that the airfields that they are using to hit our cities are within the range of deep strikes,” Umerov said on CNN.
Ukraine has used its existing supply of ATACMS to target high-value Russian assets in occupied Crimea, including air defenses, ammo depots and airfields. The entire Crimean Peninsula falls within range of ATACMS, making it a prime area to use the US-manufactured missile, the US official said.
Umerov said Ukraine is pushing to lift the ATACMS restrictions to protect Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.
“They’re killing our citizens. That’s why we want to deter them, we want to stop them, we don’t want [to] allow their aviation to come closer to our borders to bomb the cities,” said Umerov.
The US remains focused on critically needed air defenses, which the Biden administration has provided in nearly every military aid package. The US has also placed Ukraine at the top of the priority list for air defenses, the US official said, diverting $2 billion in air defense assets to Kyiv that was originally slated to go to other countries.
Umerov also denied that the firing of the Ukrainian Air Force commander was connected to the death of one of Ukraine’s top pilots when a US-made F-16 fighter jet crashed just days earlier.
“I would probably say this is a rotation,” said Umerov “This is two separate issues… at this stage, I would not connect them.”
Zelensky did not say whether his decision to fire Mykola Oleshchuk was related to the F-16 crash on Monday, but said the command level of the Air Force needed to “strengthen.”
Umerov called the death of the pilot “unfortunate” and said that Ukraine is investigating what happened.
“We’re analyzing what has happened,” said Umerov. “We’ve also opened this file to our partners so they are also analyzing this and investigating along with us.”
With all eyes on the Ukrainian incursion into the Russian oblast of Kursk, Umerov said Ukraine is more focused on the “capabilities” that area allows them rather than holding the Russian territory to trade for land Russia has captured from Ukraine.
“We are focused to increase our capabilities to withstand, to repel the Russians from the temporary occupied territories,” said Umerov.
Ukraine’s top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said Friday that Ukrainian forces have advanced up to two kilometers (about 1.2 miles) further into Kursk over the last 24 hours.
“Over the [past] day, our troops advanced up to 2 kilometers in some areas, taking control of 5 square kilometers of the territory,” Syrskyi told Zelensky and other officials in a staff meeting.
But as Ukraine pushes further into Kursk, Russian forces are slowly gaining ground in eastern Ukraine, inching toward the city of Pokrovsk, a strategic city that sits on a key supply road between military hubs. The city forms the backbone of Ukraine’s defenses in the area, a valuable prize for the Russian military, but one the Kremlin is pursuing at an extremely high cost. The US official said Russia is suffering 1,000 casualties a day as they grind forward in eastern Ukraine, the highest casualty rate of the conflict.","['Michael Conte', 'Oren Liebermann']",en

The Ukrainian Defense Forces do not believe pilot error was behind the incident, the source added.
Pilot Oleksiy Mes, known as “Moonfish,” was killed in the crash while “repelling the biggest ever aerial attack” by Russia against Ukraine, said the source, adding that the pilot was buried on Thursday.
The crash is being investigated and international experts will be invited to participate in the probe, the source added.
The General Staff of Ukraine’s army said later on Thursday that several F-16 jets were deployed alongside anti-aircraft missile units to fight the Russian attack.
“During the approach to the next target, communication with one of the aircraft was lost. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died,” the General Staff said in the update.
The death of the pilot is a major blow for Ukraine. The first F-16s only arrived in the country earlier this month and Moonfish was one of the few pilots trained to fly them.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that the Ukrainian Air Force used the F-16 to destroy missiles and drones launched by Russia on Monday, the first time any Ukrainian official confirmed the jets were being used in combat.
Kyiv waited a long time to get hold of the F-16s, and Zelensky has been asking its Western allies for the fighter jets since the start of the full-scale invasion.
But as with other equipment, Western countries hesitated before finally agreeing to provide F-16s. The Netherlands and Denmark pledged to provide them early summer in 2023, but it took another few weeks for the United States to green-light the transfer.
When they arrived earlier this summer, Zelensky said he and his government held “hundreds of meetings and negotiations” to secure the jets.
A group of Ukrainian pilots started their F-16 training in the US in the fall. While it can take years to get fully trained up to fly the planes, Moonfish and others had to do it in six months.
Ukraine is hoping the F-16 will give it a much-needed boost. The jets are multi-role: they can provide air cover for troops, attack ground targets, take on enemy planes and intercept missiles. With the right armament, F-16s could deter Russian fighter-bombers from approaching the battlefield.
Still, the jets are no silver bullet. Ukraine can use them to deny Russia control over the skies, but experts say their capabilities are inferior to the most modern Russian combat aircraft that would likely prevail in an air battle with the F-16.
Moonfish: Top pilot who lobbied hard for F-16
Moonfish and another pilot Andriy Pilshchikov, known by the call sign “Juice,” became the faces of Ukraine’s campaign to get the F-16s.
It was an uphill battle, but Juice and Moonfish pulled through it together. They were young and enthusiastic, spoke good English and were willing to fight to get the US jets into Ukrainian skies.
Flying the F-16 was their dream and when Juice died in a plane crash during a combat mission last August, Moonfish made it his goal to fulfill it.
Of the two, Moonfish was the quiet one: an aviation geek not keen on publicity. But when Juice died, Moonfish had to take his place. In a rare interview with CNN, he admitted that if Juice were alive, he’d be giving interviews.
A man of few words, passionate about his job, he had his emotions under control. A straight talker who knew everything about F-16s.
“Andriy was the ‘ideas man’ and the main driving force behind it all,” Moonfish said. “And I feel responsible to him for ensuring these planes arrive.”
Speaking to CNN while in training, he said it was necessary for him and other Ukrainian pilots to undergo a truncated version of the training. “We would have had a lot of time to study the jet completely in peacetime, but we do not have the time,” he said.
In a statement issued later on Thursday, the Ukrainian Air Force said Moonfish destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack drone on Monday, before he was killed in the crash. The air force said he was posthumously awarded the rank of colonel.","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Daria Tarasova-Markina']",en

Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, will meet with US officials “to try to concretely convince the White House to lift restrictions on long-range weapons strikes on Russian territory,” the lawmaker said.
“They will provide a list of priority targets, without which it will be difficult to change the course of the war in Ukraine’s favor.”
Umerov will meet Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday, US officials told CNN. It’s unclear who Yermak will meet. In previous visits to Washington, he has met Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.
Politico first reported that a list will be presented.
On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky once again called for allowing Ukraine to carry out strikes deeper inside Russia and “lifting the restrictions on long-range strikes for Ukraine now,” arguing it would end the war sooner “for Ukraine and the world as a whole.”
Ukraine is making a concerted push to pressure the US ahead of the presidential election in November with Kiev concerned that a victory for former President Donald Trump could mean the US would withdraw support its war effort.
The visit comes after Ukraine launched a surprise offensive into Russian territory earlier this month. The operation in the Kursk region has so far been limited to a box the US drew in Russia to which the use of American weaponry would be limited, even as one US official acknowledged earlier this month the offensive was “not what we had in mind.”
Kyiv has repeatedly pushed to use American and Western weapons to strike targets deeper in Russia, especially as the Russian military has moved its high value assets, such as military aircraft and control nodes, farther from the front lines.
‘No difference how deep the targets are’
“We consider strikes deep into Russian territory with American weapons no more provocative than strikes with American weapons on Russian territory near the border,” the Ukrainian lawmaker told CNN. “Both are Russian territory and it makes no difference how deep the targets are.”
Instead, Ukraine has used its long-range US weapons, such as Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), to take out advanced Russian air defenses inside occupied Crimea.
Previously, the US has allowed Ukraine to use American weaponry to strike Russian forces near the border as Kyiv defended itself against cross-border attacks. Russia launched a new offensive in the Kharkiv region in May, but after seizing some new territory, Ukraine was able to slow advancing Russian forces, particularly as the Biden administrated eased some restrictions on the use of US weapons.
But the Biden administration has refused to allow Ukraine to use US weapons for long-range strikes deep into Russian territory.
“You’ve heard us say that the Ukrainians can use US security assistance to defend themselves from cross-border attacks, in other words counter-fire,” said Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder on Tuesday. “But as it relates to long-range strike, deep strikes into Russia, our policy has not changed.”
A senior US official told CNN the Biden administration welcomes the engagement as it works to get a better understanding of Ukraine’s strategy and how the incursion could change the nature of the conflict. Given Ukraine’s difficulty recruiting and training soldiers, the US had expected that such a move would not have been possible for Zelensky to carry out until the spring.
Zelensky said publicly at a conference in Ukraine that the incursion is the first step of a multi-phase effort described as a “powerful package of forcing Russia to end the war in a diplomatic way,” according to a translation of his remarks. Zelensky referenced a broader vision for an endgame – and plans to reveal that vision in September to Biden, Harris and, possibly Trump – an approach that also seemed to take the White House by surprise.
“We need to hear from him directly,” a senior US official told CNN. “He was in public discussing the terms of an endgame … that’s the type of (private) conversation that would be helpful to have.”
Biden last spoke to Zelensky on August 23 – and released a new tranche of military aid – in the leadup to Ukraine’s Independence Day.
The Ukrainian seizure of Russian land in Kursk earlier this month injected a fresh wrinkle of uncertainty in what had become a grinding war of attrition with only small incremental gains apparently possible for either side.
Putin facing difficult decisions
While US officials expect that Russian President Vladimir Putin will eventually mount a counteroffensive to retake Kursk, the “expectation is that that will be a difficult fight for the Russians,” CIA Deputy Director David Cohen said on Wednesday.
That may force Russia to make some difficult decisions about where it allocates troops that could create manpower challenges for him along the frontline in Ukraine – even as Ukraine may have to contend with precisely the same issue in order to hold Kursk, as it now appears committed to doing for at least a period of time.
One US military official in the region said that Russia will likely need a three-to-one ratio to eject the Ukrainians, a critical mass of forces that will likely take Moscow at least three weeks to put together.
Multiple US and western officials told CNN that there is no sense that the Ukrainian offensive crossed any kind of “red line” for the Russian president that might cause him to take dramatic action outside of the bounds of convention warfighting, like using a tactical nuke, for example.
Still, although its impact is yet unknown, the fight for Kursk could have a potentially significant impact on the overall strategic outcome of the war, Cohen and others said.
Putin “is not only going to have to face the fact that there is a front line now within Russian territory that he’s going to have to deal with,” Cohen said. “He has to deal with reverberations back in his own society that they have lost a piece of Russian territory.”
Recent analysis from the open-source intelligence firm Filter Labs found that sentiment on Russia social media towards Putin has been “deteriorating” since the Ukrainian seizure of Kursk.
But longtime Russia watchers point out that Putin has faced popularity hits before in the face of significant “embarrassments” – the Ukrainian sinking of the Moskva, or Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin’s march on Moscow, for example – and he has not been forced or persuaded to change course in Ukraine.","['Jennifer Hansler', 'Oren Liebermann', 'Katie Bo Lillis', 'Kayla Tausche']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/28/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-strategy-us-election-intl/index.html,Zelensky is rolling the dice on the battlefield with one eye on the US election,2024-08-28 15:19:27,"The past few weeks in the Ukraine war have felt like, to borrow an adage often attributed to Lenin, that decades have happened in them. It is perhaps the fastest moment of change in the conflict since it began, and heralds Kyiv throwing everything it has down on the table to try and bring palpable results before the US election alters its fate, maybe irrevocably.
Since the surprise invasion of Russia’s Kursk region in early August, Ukraine’s risk tolerance has rocketed. Its top brass unveiled Tuesday it had taken 100 Russian settlements, as reports emerged of its forces trying to break into Belgorod region too.
The shock incursion is now turning into a longer-term project, although Kyiv insists it is a buffer zone it seeks, and not a revenge occupation. It is remarkable how powerless the Kremlin appears to be to halt Ukraine’s progress, now three weeks in, despite having diverted 30,000 troops in that direction, according to a Ukrainian assessment given during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s annual news conference Tuesday. But this bold move has company.
The past months have seen Ukraine targeting Russia’s deepest infrastructure at will. Airfields. Oil refineries. Ammunition hubs. All daily. A Ukrainian drone attack last Wednesday seemed to get close to Murmansk, the northern naval hub on the Arctic circle, where much of Moscow’s nuclear submarine force is based, according to a local Russian official.
This Wednesday, flights were reportedly interrupted in Kazan, a city east of Moscow halfway to the Urals, after another apparent drone threat. The reach of Kyiv’s drones is a complication unimaginable to Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2022 when he was told his war of choice would see his forces in Kyiv in a matter of days. Billowing smoke is not uncommon in Russia’s western and southern regions now. At some point, Moscow’s increased vulnerability, and the vast damage itself, will pierce the sanitary cordon of what state media allows to be said.
Zelensky also let slip that another new capability has had an impact: the newly arrived NATO F-16 fighter jets, which he opaquely said had intercepted Russian missiles this week. This step change in Kyiv’s abilities to project air power will only grow in the months ahead and stymie Russia’s singular, long-term advantage – control of the skies and the ability to bomb at will. Moscow has responded to attacks on its territory and infrastructure with the only way it has known – in strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, hotels, and civilian targets, in horrifying waves night after night. Bu the numbers of dead have been relatively small and those of interceptions large, Kyiv has insisted.
And while Zelensky appears to be throwing all he can into the fight, Putin seems stuck peddling a familiar tune. The Kremlin is casting the Kursk debacle as if it were a natural disaster, some analysts have noted. The billowing smoke is something local officials must extinguish but Putin seems able to mostly ignore. Moscow talks of foreign mercenaries assisting Kyiv while its missiles target Western journalists in a Donetsk hotel.
It may be clumsy and ignorant as a response, but Russia’s wider aim remains unchanged and in reach. Tens of thousands of Russian troops are bearing down on the Ukrainian military hub of Pokrovsk, as they have been since Moscow captured the last small-ish town in the east, Avdiivka, in February. The goal, the tactics, the geography, the pace – always the same. Yet it is usually successful.
This is the wider gamble Zelensky appears comfortable with. The fall of Pokrovsk may be weeks away, by current assessments of the pace of Russian advance and speed of Ukrainian collapse in both positions and morale. It may, at best, submit to another slow, horrific winterlong grind before it falls. But the fall appears likely.
After Pokrovsk, there is truly nothing to defend – no major town or position – until the city of Dnipro itself, on the other side of the vast Zaporizhzhia region, about a two-hour drive away. Unless the Kursk gambit causes Russia to stretch so thin that its Donetsk operations stall, Kyiv will need to wildly fortify the rear behind Pokrovsk, or risk a pacy Russian advance across open ground that could truly alter the future shape of Ukraine.
Zelensky is, it seems, happy to accept that risk and has calculated that the damage he can do to Putin’s prestige – by taking out oil infrastructure and military targets deep inside the Motherland and annexing part of his borders – is a necessary and an urgent war aim, regardless of how oblivious Putin and his public seem to be to this embarrassment.
It gives Ukraine a “win,” at least, which may fix two of Kyiv’s urgent problems: the will of NATO allies to provide arms to a losing campaign, and the willingness of Ukrainian men to fight in a losing war. He has assessed that the loss of Pokrovsk may be inevitable, and a sacrifice Ukraine can make in the pursuit of wider damage to the Kremlin’s borders.
The heavy intwining with US politics was also evident when Zelensky said Tuesday he would in September present his ‘secret’ plan for victory – likely intense drone strikes, perhaps also using US-supplied longer-range weapons – to President Joe Biden, and candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. He is daring them to refuse him this chance, and trying to make being a Russia hawk part of the November election calculus. It may backfire, but more likely lead to some silent acquiescence, and Kyiv inflicting what damage it can as Moscow adapts again.
Yet an unfamiliar new paradigm is emerging, one which Zelensky addressed directly too. The threat of Russian escalation is almost absent in the conversation. It is as if the limit of their conventional powers has been exposed by the humiliation of Kursk, along with the emptiness of their nuclear rhetoric. The latter cannot be entirely ignored, if the Kremlin feels an existential threat so grave it is willing to risk the overwhelming conventional NATO response it will likely face from nuclear escalation. But Putin’s powers appear very diminished.
Zelensky has divined Ukraine’s moment is now, and that after November there is a 50% chance Trump will impose an unpleasant peace, or that NATO cohesion will slowly erode, or that he will struggle to fill his own trenches with willing Ukrainian soldiers. And in the weeks ahead, he is willing to leave huge swaths of territory vulnerable, as well as cross every one of Russia’s red lines – once hallowed yet now shifting daily – in the pursuit of a point at which Moscow breaks and decides to yield. He must hope the pressure is being felt as acutely by Putin.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/27/europe/world-war-two-battle-of-kursk-1943-soviet-victory-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,Kursk: Ukraine’s front inside Russia was the site of key Soviet World War II victory,2024-08-28 01:03:14,"Ukraine’s military incursion into Russian territory in the Kursk region is covering some of the same territory on which the Soviet Union scored one of its most important victories over German invaders in World War II, one that some historians say turned the tide of the war in Europe almost a year before the D-Day invasion of Normandy.
The June 6, 1944, landings on the beaches of France are often thought of in the West as the turning point in Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s conquest of Europe, but the die was cast for Germany’s defeat from July 5 to August 23, 1943, when millions of troops and thousands of tanks and armored guns did battle around Kursk, the historians say.
With victory in Kursk, “the Soviets seized the initiative in the east and never surrendered it until the end of the war,” said Michael Bell, executive director of the Jenny Craig Institute for the Study of War and Democracy at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans.
What was the Battle of Kursk?
In the spring of 1943, Hitler’s army in the east was badly wounded by the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Germans lost almost a million men in their attempt to take the city on the Volga River, rout a battered Soviet army, and capture oil fields in the southern Caucasus that could provide the fuel for Germany’s full conquest of Europe.
Soviet leader Josef Stalin ordered Stalingrad defended at all costs and German advances during the late summer and fall of 1942 were pushed back during the winter, and what was left of the German forces in the city surrendered by February 1943.
As German forces were pushed back along the Eastern Front after Stalingrad, Hitler’s generals looked for a way to regain the initiative in the east and settled on trying to pinch off a Soviet salient, a 150-mile, north-to-south bulge in the German lines, defended by more than a million men and centered on Kursk.
The generals wanted to attack in the spring, but Hitler pushed back the start of the operation, dubbed Operation Citadel, so some of Germany’s newest tanks could be dispatched to the battlefront.
This gave the Soviets ample time to prepare defenses for what was an obvious point for an attack, said Peter Mansoor, a professor of history at The Ohio State University and former US Army armored cavalry commander.
“It was pretty easy to tell that the Germans would have an interest in squeezing this bulge out of the front,” Mansoor said.
Germany would commit as many as 800,000 troops and around 3,000 tanks to take that salient.
But they faced formidable defenses.
Bell, from the World War II museum, said the Soviets prepared a series of defensive lines, dug 3,000 miles of anti-tank ditches and laid 400,000 land mines to defend the bulge, while putting 75% of its armor and 40% of its manpower on the Eastern Front in the Kursk salient or in reserve behind it.
While the new tanks Hitler wanted in the battle were more powerful than Soviet armor, Stalin’s forces had the numerical advantage, Bell said.
“The Germans have some superior equipment, but the superiority in numbers is clearly on the Soviet side,” Bell said.
Some estimates of Soviet strength in the Battle of Kursk surpass 2 million troops and more than 7,000 tanks.
The numerical advantage tipped even further to the Soviet side when on July 9, Allied forces landed on the Italian island of Sicily, opening a new front Hitler had to defend and prompting him to transfer some forces from the Eastern Front to Italy, the historians said.
The German forces that remained could not break the Soviet defenses, falling well short of objectives and never penetrating deep into rear areas.
The cost to Hitler’s forces was steep, with casualty figures ranging up to 200,000 or more killed and around 1,000 tanks lost, according to histories of the battle.
“The Germans were never able to mass forces again to the magnitude that they attempt with this battle,” Bell said.
“What Kursk did was eliminate the German armor reserves and thereby made it impossible for the Germans to successfully defend the Russian front for the rest of the war,” Mansoor said.
“After Kursk, the Germans could no longer replace their manpower losses and they lost the cream of their armored corps there,” he said.
The Kursk battlefield today
When Ukrainian forces crossed the border into the Kursk region on August 6, they had an advantage that the Germans didn’t have in 1943 – surprise.
The offensive was planned in complete secrecy, and troop movements were made to look like reinforcements of defensive positions or an exercise inside Ukraine.
And Russia was not prepared to defend that territory like it was in portions of Ukraine which it has taken, Mansoor said.
In fact, the defenses Russia set up – layers of trenches, mines, anti-tank weapons backed by artillery and armor – in parts of the Donbas region of Ukraine which it occupies are much like the Soviet defenses of Kursk in 1943, he said.
“The Russians have not changed their way of war all that much,” Mansoor said.
And that may play to Ukraine’s advantage today, said the former US Army armored cavalry officer.
Ukraine has created maneuver space inside Russian territory using combined arms warfare – successfully synchronizing infantry, long-range artillery and aviation in support of each other – something Kyiv’s forces had not been able to do before.
“It really changes the nature of the war, at least in that area of the front line,” Mansoor said.",['Brad Lendon'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/27/americas/ukraine-zelensky-victory-plan-biden-unga-intl-latam/index.html,Ukraine’s Zelensky says Russia incursion is part of ‘victory plan’ he intends to show Biden,2024-08-27 22:32:08,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the incursion into Russia’s Kursk region was the first part of Kyiv’s victory plan, which he intends to present to US President Joe Biden in September.
At a press conference in Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, Zelensky said he plans on attending the United Nations General Assembly in September, where he would meet Biden. He added that the plan’s success largely depends on the US.
“The success of this plan depends on him. Will they give what we have in this plan or not. Will we be free to use what we have in this plan or not,” he asked.
He said the plan would be presented to both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. “As we don’t know who the president of the US will be and we want to conduct this plan,” he said.
While light on details, Zelensky said the four-stage plan began with the cross-border incursion into Kursk, which he said “is already done.”
“Second direction is Ukraine’s strategic place in the security infrastructure of the world,” Zelensky continued. “Third direction is the powerful package of forcing Russia to end the war in a diplomatic way, and the fourth direction is economical.”
“Kursk region is part of our plan. The plan of our victory. It may sound ambitious for someone, but it’s a very important plan for us,” he said.
He stopped short of giving more information, saying “he can’t say everything.”
Ukraine’s surprise military incursion this month left Russia struggling to shore up its own territory. Kyiv seems to have multiple goals with the assault, from boosting morale after a torrid few months to stretching Russia’s resources.
It also raised questions on how it would end aggressions as Russia has continued to advance in eastern Ukraine and is closing in on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region, where authorities are scrambling to evacuate tens of thousands of residents
Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN that one of the objectives of the Kursk offensive was to divert Russian forces away from other Ukrainian cities, primarily Pokrovsk and Kurakhovo.
“Of course, the enemy understands this, so it continues to focus its main efforts on the Pokrovsk direction, where its most capable units are concentrated,” Syrskyi said on Tuesday in response to a CNN question.
Speaking at the heads of state institutions forum in Kyiv, Syrskyi claimed around 30,000 Russian forces have already been redeployed to Kursk, adding that the “figure is growing.”
CNN cannot independently verify this number.
At the same forum, Zelensky hailed Ukraine’s development of what he described as a new long-range rocket drone, called “Palianytsia,” which he has previously suggested was Ukraine’s “own way to take real action” amid restrictions by Western allies on the use of long-range weapons within Russia.
“Palianytsia” is a Ukrainian word for a type of bread that is typically reputed to be difficult to pronounce by Russians. Since the start of the war, Ukrainians have used the word to identify saboteurs or members of the Russian military.
As the fighting continues on several fronts, Russia launched its biggest ever aerial attack against Ukraine on Monday, hitting energy infrastructure across the country. More strikes landed on Tuesday morning, killing five people and raising the death toll from this week’s attacks to 12.

The water supply was cut immediately after that.
She knew immediately the day would turn into a struggle. She works from her home in Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, and no power means no work.
But living at war gives her a different perspective. “We don’t mind the fact that there is no electricity or water, we are more worried about our lives,” Novorzhytska told CNN in an interview.
Russia launched its biggest ever aerial attack against Ukraine on Monday, hitting energy infrastructure across the country. More strikes landed on Tuesday morning, killing five people and raising the death toll from this week’s attacks to 12.
The Ukrainian government and the country’s major energy companies would not disclose the scale of the disruption from the onslaught, but it is clear it knocked out power for millions.
Ukraine’s largest private energy company DTEK announced rolling blackouts for number of regions on Monday, including Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk.
For people on the western outskirts of the capital, this meant six hours of darkness followed by two hours of power between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
The scheduled cuts add inconvenience to people’s lives, but they at least allow them to plan around power outages – so that residents of high-rise apartment blocks don’t get stuck outside when the elevators are not working, and that people charge up vital electronic devices while the power is on.
That these blackouts are already needed in the summer is particularly worrying. This situation could be far worse in a few months’ time, when demand for electricity tends to be higher in the cold, dark winter.
“The key task is to get through the winter, to provide energy supply to critical infrastructure, people and the economy,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told reporters on Tuesday.
Shmyhal said the focus now was on repair and rebuilding. “We do this all the time, after each Russian shelling billions are allocated (and) equipment is brought to Ukraine.”
Powering up
Ukrainians have become used to living under the constant threat of blackouts. Monday’s attack stood out because of its massive scale, but it was not unusual in terms of the means Moscow used and the targets it chose. Energy infrastructure has long suffered from Russian strikes.
In Kyiv, authorities have set up “points of invincibility,” tents and other areas where people can charge their electronics and use the internet during power cuts.
CNN visited several invincibility points on Monday and they were all empty. Many people carry personal power banks, carrying the back-up energy supply around along with their other essentials: keys, phone, wallet, power bank.
The frequent attacks on energy infrastructure have also led many Ukrainian cities to invest in solar power. Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said the city has been subsidising the purchase of generators and solar panels by housing cooperatives and condominiums so that they can be independent of the energy network. The government has also put tax cuts and grants into place to help people get the equipment.
The vast majority of businesses, from tiny food stalls to huge shopping malls, now have their own generators, their deep rumble synonymous with blackouts.
Maksym Holubchenko, a 25-year-old barista in Kyiv said his cafe’s generator saves it from having to shut down every time there is a power cut after Russian strikes. It happens about once a month at the moment, he said.
Kyiv was hot on Monday and the thermometer on the wall in Holubchenko’s cafe showed 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees Fahrenheit). The generator is not powerful enough to cover the needs of a normal service in the the cafe, so Holubchenko has to make compromises.
“In the winter we have enough power from the generator. In the summer we have to switch off the air conditioner and… parts of the coffee machine,” he said.
The cafe has sockets ready for customers who need to charge up their phones and other gadgets, as well as use the internet during power cuts.
For 87-year old Inna from Odesa, the current blackouts bring back memories from her childhood. “I already survived World War II, so I have some experience … I bought some candles and I wish we win this this war as soon as possible. With minimum casualties. This has to be over,” she told CNN.
Russia has been targeting Ukraine’s energy grid since its full-scale invasion in February 2022 but this year Moscow began specifically targeting power generation facilities: thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations and even energy storage facilities.
Olha Matskiv, a legal expert at Global Rights Compliance, an international NGO that is advising Ukraine on investigating and prosecuting war crimes, said the attacks are “creating conditions inside Ukraine that are incompatible with life.”
“This is a tactic that the Russian army is using to drain Ukraine’s internal reserves, both human and financial, slowing down the country’s economy, which cannot develop when businesses are closing due to lack of electricity,” she added.
The government has been trying to fortify Ukraine’s energy network so that it can withstand strikes, first wrapping them to protect them from shrapnel and then using reinforced concrete defenses that can withstand some direct hits.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Smyhal said the measures are working. “Dozens of missiles attacked substations on Monday and we lost a very small amount of our equipment out of dozens of hits yesterday thanks to the protection,” he told reporters.
He added that Ukraine is experimenting with huge protective structures the size of three football fields to cover bigger power stations.
“They are extremely expensive, and their economic feasibility is still not clear. The cost of such protection for six substations is 188 billion hryvnia ($4.5 billion). This is an incredible amount of money that partners are not ready to give and that is not in the state budget,” Smyhal said.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en

Moscow has since followed that with a second wave of strikes early Tuesday morning.
Monday’s onslaught, which killed at least seven people and caused power outages in several cities, marked Russia’s “most massive air attack” in more than two-and-a-half years of conflict, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk.
The nationwide strikes used “more than 100 missiles of various types and around 100 Shahed drones,” Zelensky said. Ukraine shot down 102 of the missiles and 99 attack drones, Oleshchuk said.
At least 15 regions were targeted by a combination of drones, cruise missiles and hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, officials said, from the frontline eastern regions of Kharkiv and Dnipro to the southern port city of Odesa, as well as the capital, Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky vowed to retaliate against Russia for the attack during a daily address as he implored allies to lift restrictions on using Western weapons for long-range strikes inside Russian territory.
Long-range strikes are instrumental in “destroying” Russian forces “exactly in the areas” from where they launch strikes on Ukraine, Zelensky said. “This is the optimal counter-terrorism tactic,” he added.
Russia’s Tuesday strikes killed at least five people and injured more than 10 across Ukraine, according to officials. Of those, two died after a missile attack on a hotel in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, and three were killed in the Zaporizhzhia region.
Zelensky said those strikes used more than 90 aerial weapons, including 81 Shahed drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles.
Ukraine had been bracing for a major Russian attack for weeks, in response to Kyiv’s shock incursion into the border region of Kursk – the first foreign invasion of Russia since World War II. Ahead of Ukraine’s Independence Day on Saturday, the US Embassy in Kyiv had warned of an increased risk of Russian drone and missile attacks.
Monday’s overnight assault came hours after Ukraine’s foreign ministry called on Belarus to withdraw what it described as a “significant” buildup of Belarusian forces and equipment at their shared border. Kyiv also reported that former Wagner mercenaries were among the troops at the border and urged Minsk “not to make tragic mistakes for their country under Moscow’s pressure.”
Throughout the conflict, Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, attempting to plunge its citizens into darkness and use freezing winter temperatures as a weapon of war. After Monday’s attack, Ukraine’s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said “the energy sector is in the crosshairs” and the extent of the damage was being investigated.
“Russian terrorists have once again targeted energy infrastructure,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Telegram Monday.
Ukraine’s national energy company, Ukrenergo, has been forced to implement emergency power cuts to stabilize the system, Shmyhal said. Power outages have been recorded in several cities, including Kyiv and Dnipro, according to Serhii Kovalenko, chief executive of the Yasno energy company.
Later Monday, Russia’s Defense Ministry confirmed it had launched “a massive strike with long-range precision air and sea-based weapons” against Ukraine’s power grid and rail lines, which it said disrupted the transport of weapons and ammunition to the frontlines. “All designated targets were hit,” the ministry said.
Deaths from Monday’s strikes were reported in the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Volyn, Zhytomyr and Kharkiv regions, according to Ukrainian authorities. At least 47 people were injured in the attacks, including four children, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said.
CNN teams in Kyiv and Dnipro heard several explosions overnight into Monday.
In Kyiv, the head of the city military administration said air defenses were working in the region and the outskirts of the capital and advised people to stay in shelters. In Kharkiv, emergency services were working at an undisclosed number of sites targeted in the attacks, according to its regional military head.
Although Kyiv’s Western allies have provided Ukraine with vast amounts of military equipment, they have placed strict conditions on how this can be used. Fearing Russian escalation, Western countries have prohibited Ukraine from using the weapons it has been given to strike missile and drone launch sites deep inside Russia, meaning Kyiv has to rely mostly on its air defenses to stem Moscow’s attacks.
Following Monday’s strikes, Ukrainian officials once again asked their allies to allow them to strike deeper into Russia.
“Every leader, every one of our partners, knows the decisive actions required to end this war justly. Ukraine cannot be constrained in its long-range capabilities when the terrorists face no such limitations,” Zelensky said.
Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry, Dmytro Kuleba, also made two requests of Kyiv’s allies: “First, affirming Ukraine’s long-range strikes on all legitimate military targets on Russian territory. Second, agreeing to use partners’ air defense capabilities to shoot down missiles and drones close to their airspace.”
West of Ukraine, Poland’s military said it is searching for what is believed to be a drone that likely entered its territory during Russia’s overnight assault, according to Polish state media.
The Polish armed forces were ready for a possible shooting down of this object, which was not a rocket, that crossed the border on Monday morning but weather conditions did not allow for visual identification, a spokesperson for the Polish army’s operational command Jacek Goryszewski said Monday. He added that no explosions were recorded.
The widespread aerial assault comes two days after a Russian strike on a hotel in the Donetsk region killed a British safety adviser and wounded two journalists over the weekend.
Ryan Evans, a former soldier, had been working with Reuters since 2022 and advised its journalists on safety around the world including in Ukraine, Israel and at the Paris Olympics, the news agency said.
Residents without power
When Kyiv experiences blackouts, a constant, deep roar can be heard over the city – the sound of generators humming in front of shops, as business owners try to minimize the impact of the latest attack.
Maksym Holubchenko a 25-year old barista in Kyiv, was still at home when Russia launched Monday’s early-morning barrage, but he said he went to work anyway.
“This is the reality for us, it’s been nearly three years. Everyone is used to it. Just a normal day, well… it’s not normal – this shouldn’t be happening in the 21st century,” he told CNN.
While the generator keeps the cafe running, it adds extra cost and work. Holubchenko said at the moment, power cuts like the one on Monday happen roughly once a month.
“You need to change oil, the barista has to start it, service it, when we come to work we just want to make coffee and work with people but have to get busy with other things,” he said. With the generator needing some 3.5 liters of fuel every hour, fuel canisters are lined up at the back of the cafe, ready to top it up.
Lights were out in many parts of Kyiv on Monday, with residents saying they lost power after hearing several loud explosions.
“There is nowhere to go and to hide,” Katerina, 35, told CNN by phone on Monday.
She had recently left the city with her child to avoid shelling and is now living without power or water on the capital’s outskirts.
“The explosions were so powerful that the house was shaking and the windows were shaking,” she said. “After four or five explosions, my husband and I decided to wake up the baby and go outside. Since the house was not new and there was no shelter or cellar to hide in, it was not safe to stay inside, because of the shrapnel from the windows.”
Anna, who lives on the right bank of Kyiv, woke up to an air-raid alarm followed by explosions.
“The bulk of the missiles were shot down in the region, but even from there I could hear the sounds of explosions and the work of the air defense. My friends from other parts of the city wrote that their electricity and water were cut off,” she said.
In Kyiv metro station, which has been used throughout the war as an air-raid shelter, residents told CNN how they had woken in fear to the sound of sirens.
“I woke up from explosions and immediately came to the subway,” Dmytro, 18, told CNN. “It was scary to hear the sound of explosions. Kyiv hasn’t been shelled for a long period.”","['Ivana Kottasová', 'Christian Edwards']",en

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law a bill banning religious groups with ties to Russia Saturday, Ukraine’s Independence Day. The bill’s main target is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) which has historically been linked to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Zelensky referenced the bill in his nightly address, saying “Ukrainian orthodoxy today is taking a step toward liberation from the devils of Moscow.”
The new law gives the UOC and other religious groups nine months to cut ties with Russia or risk being shut down by court order. The law passed Ukraine’s parliament on August 20, with 265 lawmakers voting for and 29 voting against.
While the UOC claims to have cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church in 2022, Ukraine’s State Service for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience says the links are still intact and the church remains in Moscow’s orbit.
Ukraine’s Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has accused the UOC of spreading pro-Moscow propaganda. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the SBU has opened criminal proceedings against more than 100 clergymen of the UOC. Nearly 50 have already been charged and 26 have received sentences, according to the SBU.
One of the clerics convicted used his sermons to defend the full-scale invasion of Russia and the seizure of parts of Ukraine. In conversations with parishioners, the cleric tried to persuade them to go to Russia or occupied regions to help Russians. He was sentenced to five years.
The purpose of this law is to ban the activities of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine “which is an instrument of Russian influence and propaganda” according to Mykyta Poturaiev, a Ukrainian member of Parliament who sponsored the bill.
“The Moscow Patriarchate is not an inspiration but a participant in the war,” Poturaiev said.
The majority of Ukrainians are Orthodox. For centuries, Ukrainian churches were subordinate to and administered by the Moscow Patriarchate. But with Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine’s Orthodox churches split. In 2019, the spiritual leader of the Orthodox world Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople officially recognized an independent Kyiv-based Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
For the leader of Ukraine’s Kyiv-based church Metropolitan Epiphanius, the law provides an opportunity “to protect the Ukrainian spiritual space from the yoke of the Russian world.”
“Everyone can see that in Russia, religious centers, not only the Moscow Patriarchate, but also the centers of Muslims, Protestants, and Buddhists, are under the full control of the Kremlin. They spread the ideology of the Russian world, justify the war against Ukraine, and say that it is a so-called holy war. That the destruction of Ukraine is a morally justified goal and even a duty of Russian troops,” he said.
According to a survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in April 2024, 83% of Ukrainians believed that the state should intervene in the activities of the UOC to one degree or another. In particular, 63% believe that Ukrainian Orthodox Church should be completely banned in Ukraine.
Metropolitan Clement, spokesperson of the UOC criticized the bill in a statement on Facebook, calling the law as an attempt “to divide people into right and wrong citizens.”
Outside a UOC church in Kyiv, a 47-year-old parishioner said recent moves against his church were stifling. “The government is now creeping into my soul. It is up to me to decide how I pray. They have gone completely crazy,” the parishioner – who refused to give his name for fear of reprisal – told CNN.
Ihor, a Ukrainian officer, used to worship in the UOC but said he has stopped going to church altogether.
While he doesn’t think politics should get involved with religion, he acknowledges “there are many priests in Ukrainian Orthodox Church who support Russia and war in Ukraine. For this they must answer for before God.”

Just as importantly, it’s also sent a political message to Kyiv’s allies that has changed the prevailing narrative of the war - that Ukrainian forces are doomed to fight an endless rearguard action against superior Russian firepower.
Suddenly, Moscow’s oft-repeated insistence that all the goals of what President Vladimir Putin still calls the “special military operation” will be achieved ring hollow. Ukrainian forces claim to have taken almost as much territory in Russia this month (some 1,200 square kilometers by their own estimates) as the Russians have won inside Ukraine all year.
Moscow has seen setbacks ever since it launched its 2022 invasion, which was designed to capture Kyiv in less than a week. But the goals – and the methods to pursue them – have not changed. Massive bombardment accompanied by costly use of infantry have gradually eaten into Ukrainian territory.
Analysis by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think-tank, said “Putin likely assesses that as long as Russia can retain the initiative and prevent Ukraine from conducting operationally significant counteroffensive operations, Russia can inflict decisive losses on Ukraine over the long term, while outlasting Western security assistance to Ukraine and Ukrainian efforts to mobilize more of Ukraine’s economy and population for the war effort.”
Mathieu Boulegue, Senior Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, agreed that “if you look at the grand strategy for each country, perhaps not much has changed.”
“But for the first time in many months this operation has forced a different narrative on the Kremlin, the first cracks in Putin’s narrative,” Boulegue told CNN.
Turning the tide of the war
The Ukrainian military has confounded a growing consensus among Ukraine’s supporters that it had little chance of recovering much – if any – of its own territory. In Kyiv’s view, Kursk demonstrates its military deserves continuing, faster and better support from allies because it can change the direction of the war.
President Volodymyr Zelensky made this point in an address last week: “We’ve already expanded and will continue to expand the circle of those who support a just end to this war. It’s essential that Ukraine enters this fall even stronger than before.”
Mick Ryan, a former general in Australia and author of the Futura Doctrina blog, said Kursk “has demonstrated Ukrainian learning and adaptation after the failure of its 2023 counteroffensive,” referring to the much-hyped assault that delivered few gains for Kyiv.
“The Ukrainian aim here is to demonstrate that Russian victory is not inevitable, and that Ukraine can fight and win,” added Ryan – persuading the doubters to sustain support and perhaps more importantly further relax restrictions on how and where their weapons can be used.
The Ukrainians have persistently sought to overcome hesitation among allies about supplying systems that might escalate the conflict - first with artillery and battle-tanks, later with F16 combat jets and longer-range missiles such as HIMARS and ATACMs.
Until May, the use of US weapons to strike Russian soil was a red line for a Biden administration apprehensive of escalation. Then came Russia’s incursion into Kharkiv region, aided by long-range strikes from well within Russian territory. The Ukrainians were in effect fighting with one hand behind their back; the city of Kharkiv was vulnerable.
The ban was relaxed, allowing some US systems to target Russian territory. In Kursk the Ukrainians have further eroded it by using armor inside Russia. US, German and UK-provided armored vehicles and tanks have been seen barreling through the Russian countryside; western missiles have brought down bridges that might otherwise abet Russian defenders.
Zelensky has said that Russia’s bluff has been called. “The whole naive, illusory concept of the so-called red lines in relation to Russia, which prevailed in the assessments of the war of some of our partners, crumbled in these days somewhere near Sudzha,” he said.
“Ukraine has demonstrated, again, that the various red lines projected by the Russian president are nothing but a chimera designed to reinforce Western political timidity about decision-making on the war,” Ryan said.
Boulegue argued the Kursk operation is a valuable way for both Ukraine’s allies “to test Putin’s pain threshold, a really good way to test Russia’s other forms of deterrence using a proxy.”
“Russian red lines are fluid, and this is another incidence of raising the temperature gradually.”
The Ukrainians have won an important political argument here: there have been no public objections from Western capitals to the opening of this new front, and indeed plaudits from many members of NATO, including Germany, the UK and the United States.
“As they see attacks coming across the border, they have to be able to have the capabilities to respond,” Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters earlier this month.
The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, went further, saying on X Wednesday that “Lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities vs the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would have several important effects: -Strengthen Ukrainian self-defense by ending Russia’s sanctuary for its attacks and bombardments of Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine. Help advance peace efforts.”
But there is a limit to the West’s level of comfort. Ukraine would like to target airfields deep inside Russia with longer-range ATACM missiles; Washington does not seem inclined to agree.
Zelensky has countered that “If our partners lifted all existing restrictions on using such weapons on Russian territory, then we wouldn’t need physically to enter the Kursk region with the aim of protecting our Ukrainian citizens in border regions and destroying the Russian aggression potential.”
But taking Russian land improves Ukraine’s bargaining position at any negotiations, and also works as a hedge should former President Donald Trump win the US election and seek to force a peace settlement on Ukraine.
Western way of fighting
The success of the Kursk incursion was not just down to Western hardware: Ukrainian intelligence gathering, planning and special forces executed the operation, along with plenty of Ukrainian-made drones, artillery, electronic warfare and even thermobaric weapons.
That “highlights Ukraine’s agency, thereby undermining Russia’s portrayal of the conflict as a proxy war with the West,” noted Olga Tatariuk at Chatham House. It also offers allies reassurance that the Ukrainians are not doomed always to be on the defensive; that they are learning the Western way of fighting after the high hopes for 2023’s counter-offensive were shattered.
As one Ukrainian soldier in Kursk described it: “This operation was very well planned. I don’t know who worked on the plan but they did a good job. We were moving in the center, we had support left and right from us. Great operation.”
The Kursk operation remains a high-stakes gamble for Ukraine at a time when Russian forces are closing in on two important hubs in eastern Donetsk: the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. But Ukrainian forces have shown that the conflict is not a one-way street.
“We don’t know yet whether this will be a footnote or a game changer,” said the analyst Boulegue. For the Ukrainians, sustaining the operation as Russia brings more artillery and aviation to bear will become increasingly difficult.
But for every passing day that Ukrainian forces control an area of Russian territory the size of Hong Kong, the Kursk incursion becomes less of a footnote.",['Tim Lister'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/politics/us-sanctions-russia/index.html,US unveils major tranche of sanctions targeting Russia,2024-08-23 15:02:20,"The United States on Friday unveiled a massive tranche of sanctions in the latest effort to target Russia’s war machine and President Joe Biden announced additional aid for Kyiv as the war in Ukraine continues.
The sanctions from the US Treasury and State Departments hit nearly 400 people and entities both in and outside Russia, including China.
The sanctions – unveiled ahead of Ukrainian Independence Day – specifically target those supporting the Russian supply chain and defense base, as well as those helping Moscow to evade current sanctions. In a further show of support for Ukraine, Biden on Friday announced a new aid package that includes air defense missiles and counter-drone equipment.
“When Russia’s senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country,” Biden wrote in a lengthy statement. “Today, it is still a free country. And the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free, sovereign, and independent country.”
Biden, who spoke Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said that for two and a half years, the Ukrainian people had “repelled Russia’s vicious onslaught, including retaking more than half of the territory Russian forces seized in the initial days of the war” and had “remained unbowed in the face of Russia’s heinous war crimes and atrocities.”
“And day after day, they have defended the values that unite people across both of our nations and around the world—including independence,” Biden wrote. “That is why I am proud we will announce a new package of military aid for Ukraine today.”
In addition to air defense equipment, the package includes anti-armor missiles and ammunition.
“Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict,” he wrote. “The independent people of Ukraine will prevail—and the United States, our Allies, and our partners, will continue to stand with them every step of the way.”
“We continue to support Ukraine’s fight for their independence, and independence that that they have had to defend pretty mightily here over the last two and a half years,” National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told reporters Friday morning. “And so, I suspect that as we officially mark their Independence Day … you’ll see that we will back up that philosophical support for their independence with more tangible support as well, including in particular more security assistance coming to Ukraine to help them as they defend themselves.”
‘Enduring commitment’
Friday’s slew of sanctions – which Biden called “part of our enduring commitment to hold Russia accountable for its aggression” – specifically crack down on a number of Chinese-based companies. The US and its European partners have expressed strong concern about Beijing’s support for Russia’s war economy and its export of dual-use items for use in the war in Ukraine.
July’s NATO Summit declaration called Beijing “a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine” and warned that China “cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.” US officials said they had warned their Chinese counterparts about the risk of supporting Moscow’s war effort.
A State Department fact sheet said it remains “concerned by the magnitude of dual-use goods exports from the PRC to Russia,” using the acronym for China’s formal name, the People’s Republic of China.
“Russia continues to leverage sanctions evasion and circumvention networks” to get microelectronics and machine tools “which it uses to make weapons,” it said. “Imports from the PRC are filling critical gaps in Russia’s defense production cycle, thereby enabling it to produce weapons, ramp up defense production, and bolster its military-industrial base.”
“Today, the Department is also designating several PRC-based entities that have supplied goods supporting Russia’s war effort, including ones responsible for developing, producing, and supplying manufacturing equipment to entities based in Russia,” the fact sheet said.
Treasury said it is targeting “numerous transnational networks, including those involved in procuring ammunition and military materiel for Russia, facilitating sanctions evasion for Russian oligarchs through offshore trust and corporate formation services, evading sanctions imposed on Russia’s cyber actors, laundering gold for a sanctioned Russian gold company, and supporting Russia’s military-industrial base by procuring sensitive and critical items such as advanced machine tools and electronic components.”
It is “also targeting Russian financial technology companies that provide necessary software and IT solutions for Russia’s financial sector,” the press release said.
At the same time, the State Department “is targeting entities and individuals involved in Russia’s future energy, metals, and mining production and exports; sanctions evasion; Russia’s military-industrial base, including armed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) production, Belarusian support for Russia’s war effort, and air logistics entities; additional subsidiaries of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom; and malign actors involved in the attempted, forcible ‘re-education’ of Ukraine’s children,” the Treasury Department press release said.
The new round of sanctions come as Ukraine has launched an audacious incursion into Russia’s Kursk region that has left Moscow on the back foot for the first time in months. On Tuesday, Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said troops had advanced up to 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 93 settlements.
Kirby said Friday that “it’s too soon to know whether what’s going on in Kursk … the potential impact that that could have in terms of escalation, but it is something that we remain concerned about.”

https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/europe/modi-zelensky-ukraine-india-intl-hnk/index.html,India’s Modi arrives in Ukraine for talks with Zelensky weeks after Putin meeting,2024-08-23 06:20:32,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kyiv on Friday for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that will be keenly watched in Russia as its assault on its neighbor grinds on.
Modi’s visit, the first by an Indian leader since Ukrainian independence, comes just weeks after he traveled to Moscow in a symbolic first overseas trip of his new term as leader, where he held talks with President Vladimir Putin that were criticized by Kyiv.
After talks concluded, India’s Minister of External Affairs, S. Jaishankar, stressed that India is committed to helping end the war. “We are very, very keen that this conflict should come to an end,” Jaishankar said at a press briefing.
Despite repeatedly called for a ceasefire and peace in Ukraine, New Delhi has refrained from condemning Russia’s invasion as it seeks to maintain relations with Moscow – a major supplier of its arms and a longstanding partner it sees as key to balancing its strained relationship with China.
India has also acted as an economic lifeline for Russia, ramping up purchases of its crude oil after countries around the world slapped sanctions on Moscow, isolating it economically.
India overtook China as the world’s biggest importer of Russian oil last month, according to Reuters, citing data from trade and industry sources.
Jaishankar defended India’s purchasing of oil from Russia, saying it was not indicative of a wider political posture.
“India is a big oil consumer, it is a big oil importer, because we do not have oil. It is not like there is a political strategy to buy oil, there is an oil strategy to buy oil, there is a market strategy to buy oil,” Jaishankar said.
Ukraine, throughout the war, has sought to convince countries that maintain close relationships with Russia — such as India and China — to push Putin toward Kyiv’s terms for peace. Zelensky hailed Modi’s visit as “historic” and “symbolic,” thanking India for its “support of our sovereignty and territorial integrity” over two-and-a-half years of war.
The Indian leader’s arrival in Kyiv — a day ahead of Ukraine’s independence day — follows his two-day trip to Poland, where he elevated India’s ties with the NATO member. Referencing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East during a press conference in Warsaw, Modi reiterated India’s stance that “no problem can be solved on the battlefield.”
“We support dialogue and diplomacy for the early restoration of peace and stability. For this, India, along with its friendly countries, is ready to provide all possible support,” Modi said Thursday alongside Polish counterpart Donald Tusk.
Tusk praised Modi’s “intention to help end the war in Ukraine in a quick, peaceful and fair manner.”
‘Landmark visit’
Modi’s visit to Ukraine also comes at a key inflection point in the two-and-a-half-year war, as Ukrainian forces earlier this month launched an unprecedented offensive into Russian territory that Moscow is scrambling to counter.
Zelensky and Kyiv officials are urgently working to expand global backing for their peace formula, which is predicated on the withdrawal of Russian troops from their land. The upcoming US presidential election has raised concerns that crucial American backing could be cut if Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has been critical of NATO and US support for Kyiv, is elected.
Ukraine, throughout the war, has sought to convince countries that maintain close relationships with Russia — such as India and China — to push Putin toward Kyiv’s terms for peace.
But while India attended a Kyiv-backed international peace summit in Switzerland in June, it stopped short of endorsing the gathering’s communique, saying that resolution requires a “sincere and practical engagement between the two parties to the conflict.”
During his visit to Ukraine, Modi is expected to discuss with Zelensky what India’s Foreign Ministry described as “the entire gamut of bilateral relations,” including trade, infrastructure and defense.
“This landmark visit, of course, takes place against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which will also form part of discussions,” the ministry’s secretary for the West, Tanmaya Lal, said Monday.
The Ukrainian presidential office said Modi and Zelensky would “discuss issues of bilateral and multilateral cooperation” and that documents would be signed. Later, Jaishankar confirmed that the leaders signed four agreements, covering community development projects, drug control standards, cultural exchange and agriculture.
Officials from both countries have in recent months expressed interest in restoring trade, which has dropped during the war, according to annual data from Ukraine.
Modi and Zelensky have met twice on the sidelines of G7 summits since the start of the war, including in June in Italy.
Zelensky last month condemned Modi’s meeting with Putin, which coincided with a Russian assault on several Ukrainian cities and a deadly strike on a children’s hospital.
Then, the Ukrainian leader described Modi’s rapport with Putin as a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.”
Modi did not directly address the strikes at the time, but he made what appeared to be some of his most critical comments to date on the war, saying “any person who believes in humanity is troubled when there are deaths, especially when innocent children die.”
He also called for a “path to peace through dialogue.”",['Simone McCarthy'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/world/putin-response-ukraine-kursk-intl/index.html,Ukraine’s march into Russia exposes Putin’s crisis management problem,2024-08-23 11:35:56,"Russia’s President Vladimir Putin likes to project himself as a strongman. But his track record of handling recent crises in Russia reveals a different side of his presidential persona: one of paralysis and indecision.
A day and a half after Ukrainian troops stormed a Russian border crossing and continued, almost unimpeded, across the wide green fields of the southern Kursk region, Putin finally made his first public remarks on the matter. He called the incursion a “massive provocation”, accused Ukraine of indiscriminately firing on civilians, and then moved on quickly to other government business, including how to mark Russia’s “Construction Worker’s Day.”
It would take another five days, and the loss of nearly 30 settlements, before he promised a military response. There was no visit to the region to meet the tens of thousands of evacuees, no declaration of martial law.
In March, after the terror attack at the Crocus City concert hall in Moscow, Russia’s deadliest in decades, it took Putin more than 24 hours to address the nation. Despite a claim of responsibility from ISIS-K, he continued to insist that Ukraine, and the West had played a role. The US had in fact warned Russia an attack could be imminent. Putin never visited the site of the attack, or survivors in hospital.
When Evgeny Prigozhin, then the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, launched his aborted mutiny last June, the Russian leader’s response was marked by inconsistency. After initially slamming the incident as “treachery,” Putin left it two days before speaking publicly again, at which point he thanked the Wagner troops involved for standing down, and offered them military contracts. Then he invited Prigozhin to tea at the Kremlin. Two months later Prigozhin was killed in a mysterious plane crash in Russia.
More distant parallels are also easy to find, and Putin chose this week to highlight one himself. For the first time in 16 years he visited School No.1 in Beslan, more than a week before the 20th anniversary of the terror attack on the school that killed more than 300 people, many of them children. In 2017 the European Court of Human Rights found that not only had the Russian authorities failed to act on prior knowledge of an imminent attack, but that the security operation was “disorganized and suffered from a lack of leadership.”
“He is not good at resolving crises,” Boris Bondarev, a former Russian diplomat who resigned two years ago in protest over the war in Ukraine, and is still living outside Russia, told CNN. “It’s risky, it’s not predictable. Putin likes comfort, he likes it when he is making the crisis for others, when he controls the situation.”
Shock offensive left Kremlin reeling
Experts say Russia’s military response in Kursk has somewhat mirrored the fumbling reactions of its president.
“The initial response when they got over the shock of what was happening would have been who have we got in the cupboard left to defend,” retired Australian Major General Mick Ryan, the author of a new book “The War for Ukraine: Strategy and Adaptation Under Fire,” told CNN. “Whether it’s conscripts, whether it’s understrength battalions from the Ukrainian theater, or strategic reserves.”
Battlefield accounts have backed up the sense that a motley selection of Russian troops were rushed in, as Moscow grappled with the dilemma of how to balance defending its own soil with keeping up the slow momentum on the eastern front. Ukrainian officials said some troops were redeployed from Kharkiv region and the southern front. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claimed early on that his special forces unit, the Akhmat brigade, had been deployed. Naval infantry officers from the Black Sea fleet in Crimea are also involved.
The diverse groupings complicated Russian efforts to coordinate its resistance, with one pro-Russian military blogger even noting on August 14 that Ukraine was deliberately creating disruptions and then retreating, “taking advantage of the fact that our diverse forces, who don’t always have good communications with each other, were activated to repel this invasion.”
Russia’s bureaucratic response to the incursion has been equally unwieldy. Defense Minister Andrei Belousov set up a coordinating council to handle security in the border regions and this week announced he was dividing up responsibilities between no fewer than five different officials.
This, according to the Institute for the Study of War, “will likely create additional confusion within the Russian MoD and friction among the Russian MoD, FSB, and Rosgvardia [Russia’s national guard], all of which are attempting to operate in Kursk Oblast,” and could jeopardize Russia’s ability to mount an effective counterattack.
Still, more than two weeks in, there are now signs of a more coordinated resistance. Dmytro Kholod, commander of Ukraine’s “Nightingale” battalion, currently in Kursk, told CNN by phone on Wednesday that he has noticed a shift in the behavior of Russian troops. “Now, the forces they have brought to this area are trying to storm us somehow,” he told CNN. “They no longer surrender by the hundreds. They are trying to shoot and fight back, but they still surrender when we attack them.”
Ryan, the Australian retired general, agrees Russia is moving beyond the initial knee-jerk response phase, and it should start to look more organized in the days and weeks ahead. But, he believes the past two weeks have also laid bare Putin’s priorities and his own people are not currently top of the list.
“The decision will be Putin’s: What is the most dangerous to him? Ukrainians in Kursk or not succeeding in the Donbas. I think at the moment he’s decided that it’s more dangerous to not make this progress in the Donbas than to throw everything at Kursk.”
Experts agree the Kursk incursion has not fundamentally changed Putin’s overarching strategy of attrition – to exhaust Ukraine, and try to outlast its allies. And yet, Ukraine’s surprise move has emboldened those who had previously questioned the West’s policy of limiting certain types of military aid, and their use inside Russia.
And that may well have been part of Ukraine’s strategy. On August 19, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky allowed his closely held veil of gratitude towards his Western allies to lift momentarily.
“The entire naïve, illusory concept of so-called red lines regarding Russia, which dominated the assessment of the war by some of our partners, has crumbled these days somewhere near Sudzha,” he told a gathering of Ukrainian diplomats, referring to a Russian town that Ukrainian troops had occupied.
His point is that Western fears that Russia may interpret the use of American or British long-range missiles on its soil as a conventional threat worthy of a nuclear response – Russian nuclear doctrine does allow for this – are now more remote than ever, given its lack of a coherent military response to its first foreign occupation since World War II.
“The current NATO strategy for helping Ukraine is a strategy for defeat. It is just a strategy for perpetuating war and allowing Russia to wait us all out,” said Ryan. “We need a fundamental reassessment.”
Former Russian diplomat Bondarev argues Putin’s own reaction serves as further proof that the West needs to formulate a more robust response to Putin’s aggression.
“When some Westerners say we shouldn’t corner Putin because he will become a cornered rat and will fight back with all his might,” he told CNN. “Now we see that when he’s really presented with a crisis, he’s not a cornered rat, he’s just like an imposter.
“And that’s why he should not be feared so much.”",['Clare Sebastian'],en

Communities in and around Pokrovsk are being urged to flee within the next two weeks as Russian forces push forward – which comes despite Ukraine’s own incursion into Russian territory that has taken Moscow by surprise.
On Thursday, Russia insisted it had thwarted another Ukrainian attempt to push into the border region of Bryansk, as Ukraine continues to make advances into the Kursk region.
Roughly 600 to 700 people have been evacuating daily, the administration said. On Thursday, the national rail network said at least 371 people evacuated from Prokrovsk by train, with the network having to add nine carriages to accommodate the large crowds.
Evheniya, a 65-year-old resident in Pokrovsk who worked as a chef at a local restaurant, told CNN how she hears the sounds of blasts at night, but has no plans to leave the city.
“At night [I hear] blasts and I sit up [in my bed]. [It’s] so scary when you are alone. I wait till it calms down, and just as I lay down – again,” Evheniya said.
Meanwhile Natalya, a 69-year-old Pokrovsk resident, plans to flee soon with her son telling CNN that her “nerves are on the edge.”
“When they declared evacuation the previous time, I didn’t leave,” she said. “It was more quiet, now situation is very different, much more tense.”
In Ukraine’s Donetsk region, children with their parents or other legal guardians will be forcibly evacuated from certain districts, including Pokrovsk, according to the ministry responsible for the reintegration of regions that previously fell under Russian control.
Pokrovsk is not a large city – about 60,000 people lived there before the war, and many have left since the start of the full-scale invasion. But it serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military thanks to its easy access to Kostiantynivka, another military center.
The Ukrainian military said Wednesday that Pokrovsk is now “the hottest” front of the war. Troops are repelling Russian attacks and fighting in multiple locations. The entire community encompasses Pokrovsk city, the nearby town of Myrnohrad and 39 surrounding villages.
“Don’t wait. It will not get better, it will only get worse. Leave,” was the stark warning from local official Yurii Tretiak, head of the military administration in Myrnohrad, which is now less than 3 miles from the frontline.
But Tretiak said many people are still reluctant to leave – even going so far as to hide their children from local authorities, promoting the military administration to make house visits.
“We have cases when parents hide their children. Today (August 20) we will have a meeting with the police to discuss how we will work with such people, how we will search for such parents who hide children and give false information that the children have long since left,” he said, noting that dangers are increasing with some areas of town facing daily attacks.
“Those who hesitated a week ago have mostly decided and are leaving en masse,” he said, noting that for residents who have yet to evacuate, “the most common argument is that ‘I have nowhere to go’ or ‘no one needs me.’”
“The enemy is advancing faster than expected,” Tretiak said in a radio interview on Tuesday. “So we are trying to do as much as possible to evacuate people by the end of the week.”
Ukrainian troops use the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties toward Dnipro.
Many of those evacuating Pokrovsk include children. One evacuee, Kateryna, is set to leave the city with her teenage son and toddler daughter, according to a statement by Ukraine’s rail operator.
“I have lived here for 30 years, since I was born. Can you imagine what it’s like to live here all your life and suddenly give up everything?” she said in the statement.
While the communities in and around Pokrovsk remain under fire, the Russian Ministry of Defense on Thursday said Russian troops have occupied the eastern Ukrainian village of Mezhove as part of their ongoing offensive in the area.
The ministry claimed that units from the Center group of Russian armed forces seized control of Mezhove, in the Donetsk region that was illegally annexed by Russia. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the situation in the village.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces are being reinforced in the eastern region to repel a potential Russian advance.
In his nightly address, Zelensky said: “The frontline is our position, first of all Pokrovsk direction, our Donetsk region. We understand the moves of the enemy and are strengthening ourselves.”
Russia claims attempted incursion
Meanwhile, Russian forces repelled a Ukrainian incursion attempt into the border region of Bryansk on Wednesday, according to the local governor.
“On August 21, an attempt to infiltrate the Ukrainian DRG into the territory of the Russian Federation was stopped in the Klimovsky district of the Bryansk region,” regional governor Alexander Bogomaz said on his official Telegram channel Thursday.
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) forces and military units responded to the Ukrainian attempt to break through, Bogomaz said, adding the area where the clashes took place is now stable and under Russian control.
Last Sunday, Zelensky said Ukraine’s military incursion into Kursk aims to create a “buffer zone” to prevent cross-border attacks by Moscow’s forces.
Ukraine has previously targeted the Bryansk region in operations launched since its incursion into Russia more than two weeks ago.
Ukraine’s bold cross-border advance in Russia’s Kursk region has seen Kyiv’s troops claim over 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory and take out key bridges in the western part of the country.
The assault – which poses a major embarrassment for the Kremlin – represents a notable change in tactics for Kyiv, marking the first time foreign troops have entered Russian territory since World War II.

Modi’s tour comes weeks after he traveled to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a symbolic first bilateral visit of the Indian prime minister’s new term – a trip that drew criticism from Kyiv as it defends against Russia’s grinding invasion.
Speaking to members of the Indian diaspora in Warsaw after his arrival Tuesday, Modi said India is stressing “diplomacy and dialogue.”
“India’s view is absolutely clear – this is not the era of war,” Modi said, adding that the country was a “big advocate of permanent peace in this region.”
“This is the time to unite to deal with the challenges which pose the greatest threat to humanity,” he said.
Modi’s expected meetings this week – with leaders from Poland, a key NATO member, on Thursday and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday – come during an inflection point in the war. Ukrainian forces earlier this month launched an unprecedented offensive into Russian territory, nearly two and half years after Moscow’s invasion.
New Delhi has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but refrained from condemning Russia’s assault as it seeks to maintain relations with Moscow – a long-standing partner it sees as key to balancing a strained relationship with China.
Historic visits
In Poland, Modi was meeting President Andrzej Duda and taking part in talks with Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The discussions were due to focus on enhancing cooperation, as well as “regional and global issues of mutual interest,” according to India’s Foreign Ministry, which said this was the first visit of an Indian prime minister to the Eastern European country in 45 years.
During his visit to Ukraine, Modi is expected to meet Zelensky and hold discussions on what India’s foreign ministry described as “the entire gamut of bilateral relations,” including economic ties, infrastructure and defense.
“This landmark visit, of course, takes place against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which will also form part of discussions,” ministry secretary for the West, Tanmaya Lal, said in a briefing on Monday.
International efforts to find a path to ending the war have so far fallen flat.
The US and its NATO allies have continued to stress unwavering support for Kyiv, which maintains that peace must be predicated on the withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory. Major Global South countries, including India as well as China and Brazil, have increasingly tried to position themselves as potential peace brokers – typically calling for both sides to be engaged in dialogue toward peace conditions.
Modi has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Ukraine, without condemning Russia. India has also abstained from all United Nations resolutions calling for Russian withdrawal and condemning its actions.
Heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment, India has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil since the start of the war, giving Putin a financial lifeline as he faces Western sanctions.
India attended a Ukraine-backed international peace summit in Switzerland in June but, like several major economies of the Global South, did not endorse a joint communique at the end of the gathering. China did not attend, citing Russia’s exclusion.
Modi’s visit to Russia last month coincided with a Russian assault on several Ukrainian cities and a deadly strike on a children’s hospital. The prime minister did not directly address the strikes, but made what appeared to be some of his most critical comments to date on the war.
“Whether it’s conflict, war or terror, any person who believes in humanity is troubled when there are deaths, especially when innocent children die,” Modi said then, while calling for a “path to peace through dialogue.”
Zelensky condemned that meeting, describing it as a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.”
Modi and Zelensky have met twice on the sidelines of G7 summits since the start of the war, including this past June in Italy.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/europe/china-li-qiang-russia-belarus-trip-intl-hnk/index.html,Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s No. 2 official Li Qiang praise deepening ties as Ukraine war grinds on,2024-08-21 05:46:44,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hailed “flourishing” trade ties with China during a meeting with a top Chinese official in Moscow as the two countries bolster their partnership in the face of mounting frictions with the West.
Speaking to Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Putin said Russia-China “large-scale joint plans and projects” in economic and humanitarian areas would “continue for many years,” according to a Kremlin readout.
Li, China’s No. 2 official under leader Xi Jinping, had traveled to Moscow for a longstanding annual meeting with Russia’s prime minister, which focused on economic and practical cooperation as the Kremlin continues to look to Beijing for economic partnership as its war with Ukraine grinds on.
In his remarks to Putin, the Chinese premier hailed efforts by the Russian leader and Xi to “inject strong momentum” into “deepening bilateral relations and cooperation,” according to Chinese state media.
Li’s four-day trip, which will include a stop in Russian ally Belarus, is the first visit to Russia by a high-level Chinese official since the Kremlin’s war with Ukraine took on a new dimension following a surprise, ongoing military incursion by Ukrainian forces into the Russian border region of Kursk two weeks ago.
Russia has been scrambling to repel that assault, which marks the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II and comes amid mounting pressure for a conclusion to the war in Ukraine, which began in 2022 with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor.
The Kremlin has become increasingly reliant on China’s market, goods and investment since the start of the war, when it was slapped with broad international sanctions – and both Moscow and Beijing see the other as a key counterweight against a West they see as seeking to suppress their development.
In his meeting Wednesday with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Li said China was ready to work with Russia to strengthen “all-round practical cooperation” and stressed that the countries’ relations did not “target any third party.”
The two nominal heads of government agreed to expand bilateral economic and trade cooperation and pledged to oppose any attempt to restrict their “economic development, technological progress, and international development,” according to Chinese state media.
“Certain countries” obstruct the “collective rise of emerging markets and developing countries,” the two officials said, using typical language to refer to their shared view on the United States and its allies.
An official readout from the meeting released by China’s Foreign Ministry did not mention the war in Ukraine.
Speaking to Li, Mishustin said Russia and China were “in a difficult external situation” as Western countries impose “illegitimate sanctions under far-fetched pretexts” and seek to “contain the economic and technological potential of Russia and China.”
“That is why it is important to concentrate efforts on protecting our common interests, building a multipolar world order and strengthening coordination on international platforms,” he said, according to Russian state media.
Record trade
Beijing has faced mounting scrutiny and pressure from the West to curtail the export of dual-use goods such as aerospace, manufacturing and technology equipment to Russia, which Western leaders and Kyiv have alleged are propping up the Russian war effort.
Chinese officials have sought to present the country as a neutral, aspiring peace broker in the war, but have had limited high-level contact with Kyiv while continuing to deepen relations with Moscow across trade, diplomacy and security.
China last month hosted a top Ukrainian official for the first time since Russia’s invasion of the country nearly two and half years ago.
Last week, in response to a media inquiry on the situation in Kursk, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry called on “all parties” not to expand the battlefield, escalate fighting and “fuel the flame,” saying China would continue to work for a “political settlement of the crisis.”
Wednesday’s meeting between Li and Mishustin is part of annual talks held since 1996, typically focused on economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation and seen as a means to implement broader policy direction set by Xi and Putin.
Following Wednesday’s talks, the two sides signed a host of cooperation documents in areas including science and technology, chemical industry, maritime search and rescue, and cross-border cargo transport, according to Chinese state media.
Trade between China and Russia hit record highs last year, surpassing a target of $240 billion ahead of schedule. Russia has grown hugely reliant on China’s market, goods and investment since it was slapped with broad international sanctions following its Ukraine invasion.
Bilateral trade increased by more than a quarter year-on-year in 2023 from 2022, but has only grown about 1.6% between January and July this year over the same period last year, according to China’s customs data.
Li is expected to end his four-day trip in Belarus, where he will meet Belarusian Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko for an “in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields,” China’s Foreign Ministry said Monday.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/fact-check-trump-harris-putin-meeting-ukraine/index.html,Fact check: Trump falsely claims Harris met with Putin before Ukraine invasion,2024-08-21 23:13:54,"Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that his Democratic opponent in the presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin just days before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
Trump said in a speech in North Carolina: “Remember when Biden sent Kamala to Europe to stop the war in Ukraine. She met with Putin, and then three days later, he attacked. How did she do? Do you think she did a good job? She met with Putin to tell him, ‘Don’t do it.’ And three days later, he attacked; that’s when the attack started. Did you know that, General?” (Retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was at the North Carolina event.)
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference.
“Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said last month, according to a state-owned Russian news agency.
The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.”
CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.”",['Daniel Dale'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/world/russia-dating-apps-border-intl/index.html,"Quit dating apps, Russia tells border region citizens over security fears",2024-08-21 10:12:30,"Russian authorities have urged people in the border regions to stop using dating apps and limit their use of social media to prevent Ukrainian forces from gathering intelligence as it presses on with its incursion into the Kursk region.
Russia’s interior ministry issued the plea on Tuesday, telling residents of Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod regions as well as military and police personnel stationed in the area territories to refrain from using “online dating services” and be mindful of streaming videos from sensitive locations.
“The enemy actively uses such resources for information gathering,” the ministry said in a post on its official Telegram channel.
As Ukrainian troops continued their advances through Russian territory, the ministry issued a long list of recommendations, advising people not to open any hyperlinks in messages received from strangers and not to stream videos from roads where military vehicles were present.
Authorities also warned citizens that Ukrainian forces were connecting to “unprotected CCTV cameras remotely, viewing everything – from private yards to roads and highways of strategic importance.”
Troops and police officers were advised to remove all geo-tagging on their social media, as “the enemy monitors social networks in real time by these tags and reveals the actual location of military and security forces.”
Ukriane’s offensive into the Kursk region has left Russia struggling to shore up its own territory. On Tuesday, Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops had advanced up to 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault last week, capturing 93 settlements.
More than 121,000 Kursk residents have been evacuated, Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations wrote on Telegram Monday.
Ukraine’s operations also targeted the Bryansk and Belgorod regions.
Apps reveal sensitive information
The security risk stemming from social media use is not hypothetical — there is a history of soldiers inadvertently revealing sensitive information by using their phones in conflict zones.
The United States and its “Five Eyes” intelligence allies – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom – warned last year that Russian military hackers had been targeting Ukrainian soldiers’ mobile devices in a bid to steal battlefield information.
And when a high-profile Russian submarine commander was shot dead while jogging in 2023, Russian media reported he may have been targeted by an assailant tracking him on Strava, a popular running app.
The officer, Stanislav Rzhitsky, was using a public profile under his own name to track his running and cycling routes. He was killed while out jogging on one of his regular circuits.
And after a Ukrainian strike that killed nearly 100 Russian troops in the occupied Ukrainian city of Makiivka on New Year’s Day last year, Russia’s defense ministry said the “main cause” of the strike was the widespread use of cell phones by Russian soldiers, although some officials questioned that assessment.
Last month, Russian state media TASS reported that the country’s lower house of parliament proposed punishing Russian soldiers caught using smartphones while fighting in Ukraine.
The lawmakers suggested that carrying internet-connected cell phones that can help identify Russian troops or the location of forces should be classified as a “gross disciplinary offense” and be punishable by up to 10 days’ imprisonment. Multiple offenses could lead to up to 15 days in prison.
The law would also prohibit the use of other electronic devices meant for “household purposes” that allow for video and audio recording and the transmission of geolocation data.
It’s not just Russia and Ukraine though. The US Department of Defense banned military personnel from using geolocation features in 2018 after it emerged that Strava and other fitness tracking apps could pose security risks for forces around the world.","['Olga Voitovych', 'Edward Szekeres', 'Ivana Kottasová']",en

The defected soldier – with the call sign “Silver” – was an active serviceman for the unit “Storm” before volunteering for the Freedom for Russia Legion during the “winter of 2024,” the legion, a group of Russian dissidents fighting for Ukraine, said.
Silver, a 24-year-old from Siberia who joined the Russian army in 2021, gave his reasons for defecting in an interview posted on YouTube by the “I Want to Live” project – a Ukrainian government initiative which receives appeals from Russian servicemen in Ukraine wishing to surrender.
“I wanted to serve in the army, I gave an oath to protect my motherland. My motherland is there [in Russia] and no-one attacked it. I didn’t want to serve for Russia during the war and didn’t want to die for Putin,” he said.
Silver took part in the fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Avdiivka area from the Russian side of the border as a drone operator, he explained in the interview. He had also previously served on China’s border with Russia.
“Silver was a member of the resistance for several months and transmitted important operational information to us (the location of forces and equipment, plans, tasks in a specific section of the front, etc.),” the Freedom for Russia Legion said.
Escaping the Storm unit, Silver “activated explosive devices” in the unit’s headquarters, seriously injuring the commander and several senior officers, according to the legion.
The legion posted a video to its YouTube channel taken from a hidden camera claiming to show the operation. Several men are seen in the video in army uniforms before an explosion erupts, causing a fire.
“During the retreat, Silver mined the path and went along the agreed route. The legion command, together with the ‘I Want to Live’ team, organized Silver’s exit from the combat line. Now he is undergoing a basic training course as a legion recruit,” the Legion said.
Ukraine’s intelligence department said the operation to get Silver out was named “Ocheret.”
“The Russian was motivated to cooperate with Ukraine by the systematic war crimes and other crimes of the command, including extrajudicial executions, beatings, and robberies in the occupation unit,” the Defense Intelligence said on Telegram on Tuesday.
Silver claimed in the interview that he had seen some Russian soldiers killed by their own commander.
CNN is unable to verify this claim but has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment.
The Defense Intelligence said Ukraine was able to obtain valuable intelligence on the location, number, and intentions of Russian forces “in a particular frontline area” because of the interaction with Silver.","['Eve Brennan', 'Olga Voitovych', 'Anna Chernova', 'Kostyantyn Hak']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/18/europe/zelensky-kursk-incursion-second-bridge-intl/index.html,"Ukraine aims to create Kursk ‘buffer zone,’ Zelensky says, as Kyiv’s forces blow up second Russian bridge",2024-08-18 15:45:21,"Ukraine’s military incursion into Kursk aims to create a “buffer zone” to prevent cross-border attacks by Moscow’s forces, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed Sunday, as his troops blew up a second bridge in the Russian border region.
Ukrainian forces are inching forward in Kursk amid fighting following the launch of their surprise military operation there nearly two weeks ago. But Ukraine also remains under pressure in its occupied east as Russian forces advance toward a key military hub.
The Kursk offensive has left Russia struggling to shore up its own territory. Kyiv seems to have multiple goals with the assault, from boosting morale after a torrid few months to stretching Russia’s resources. A Ukrainian presidential aide said the incursion aimed at ensuring a “fair” negotiation process.
For the first time, Zelensky on Sunday stated the strategic ambitions of the operation, saying, “It is now our primary task in defensive operations overall: to destroy as much Russian war potential as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions.”
Those include “creating a buffer zone on the aggressor’s territory,” the president said in his latest address.
“Everything that inflicts losses on the Russian army, Russian state, their military-industrial complex, and their economy helps prevent the war from expanding and brings us closer to a just end to this aggression,” Zelensky said.
Speaking on Monday, Zelensky also suggested the incursion could give Ukraine leverage in securing the release of prisoners of war.
During a meeting to discuss Ukraine’s incursion, acting Kursk governor Alexei Smirnov told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Kyiv’s forces had penetrated 12 kilometers (about 7.5 miles) inside Russia and now control 28 settlements within the Kursk region.
More than 121,000 Kursk residents have been evacuated, Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations wrote Monday on Telegram, with more than 650 people leaving the region in the past 24 hours.
Despite the shock of Kyiv’s incursion, Russia has continued to advance in eastern Ukraine and is closing in on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region, where authorities are scrambling to evacuate tens of thousands of residents.
Kyiv’s foothold in Kursk is “getting stronger” with troops reinforcing their positions, according to Zelensky. Kyiv says it controls nearly 1,000 square kilometers (about 621 square miles) of Russian territory, and both Russia and Ukraine have urged residents to evacuate from areas where heavy fighting is ongoing.
As part of efforts to cripple Moscow’s logistical capabilities and disrupt supply routes, Ukrainian forces said Sunday they blew up another bridge over the Seym river in the Kursk region, with “precision airstrikes.”
“The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistics capabilities with precision airstrikes, which significantly affects the course of combat operations,” Ukrainian Air Force commander Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk said in a social media post that included a video showing plumes of smoke engulfing parts of the bridge.
The attack comes two days after Ukrainian forces destroyed a first bridge over the Seym. Russia’s foreign ministry said Ukraine had used Western rockets to carry out that attack, which were likely US-made HIMARS.
HIMARS, or the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, has perhaps been the most revered and feared piece of weaponry in Kyiv’s fight and since arriving has helped Ukraine to take back significant swaths of territory from Russia.
The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said Sunday that Kyiv is making further gains in Kursk and shared a still image from a video, also geolocated by CNN, of what it said was a Ukrainian Defense Forces tank in the village of Olgovka, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the town of Sudzha.
Kyiv’s forces took control of Sudzha last week and established a military commandant’s office there, according to Ukrainian military officials.
On Sunday, Ukrainian armed forces published a video of what they said were “Sivalka” flamethrower systems “engaged in active combat operations” in the Kursk direction.
Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from frontline fighting in occupied Ukraine to address the territorial loss in Kursk.
And residents who fled the area due to the fighting have been warned not to go back.
“The operational situation on the territory of our district remains complicated. Some citizens are not giving up their attempts to return home, thus hindering the work of our military,” said the head of Kursk’s Korenevsky district, Marina Degtyareva, on Sunday. “Returning to the area so far is impossible for local residents, and sometimes results in terrible tragedies.”
Authorities would tell residents when it is safe to return, she added.
“I appeal to all residents of Korenevsky district, let’s be patient and let our military deal with the enemy, let’s not interfere with our defenders,” she said.
Russians reach outskirts of key city
Despite Kyiv’s push further into Kursk, Russian forces are also advancing in eastern Ukraine.
Russia’s army has moved closer to the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, which serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military because of its easy access to the town of Kostiantynivka, another military center. Ukraine uses the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties.
Vadym Filashkin, head of the Donetsk military administration, said Monday that officials in Pokrovsk have started the “forced evacuation” of children and their parents as Russian troops close in on the city. More than 53,000 people remain in Pokrovsk, including 4,000 children, according to local officials.
Serhii Dobriak, head of the Pokrovsk city military administration, warned earlier that residents have “1-2 weeks to leave, no more.”
“The Russians are close, up to 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the outskirts of the town. The town is getting ready,” Dobriak said on Sunday.
“Every town in Donetsk region has a combat unit assigned to it, and defense plans have been developed. We are working with the military to build fortifications. This is a continuous process.”
Zelensky said Sunday that Ukrainian units “are doing everything to hold the positions” amid dozens of attacks on the front lines in Donetsk.
The evacuation of civilians from Pokrovsk has been accelerated because of the approach of Russian troops. Nearly 1,800 people have been evacuated from the city over the past week alone; until recently 450-500 residents were being evacuated every month.
“The Russians are destroying our towns and villages, killing civilians, so we need to think about our safety and evacuate,” Dobriak said. “Currently, the town is being hit by missiles, MLRS, and there have been several guided aerial bomb attacks.”
Ukraine’s Vice Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk on Sunday urged residents of Pokrovsk and other settlements “in the immediate vicinity of the front line” to evacuate and “leave for safer regions.”
Vereshchuk said she understood residents would have to leave their jobs, homes and property, but “nevertheless, the lives and health of you and your children are more valuable,” and staying in the area would interfere with the work of the defense forces.
Intense fighting is also underway around the villages of Pivnichne and Zalizne in Donetsk, about 64 kilometers (40 miles) east of Pokrovsk, where Russian forces launched “a massive assault” Sunday morning, Ukraine’s General Staff said.
“The Russian invaders, supported by an armored group of 12 vehicles, attempted to break through the Ukrainian military positions and advance toward Toretsk,” the General Staff said, referring to another strategic town that could open the way for Russian forces to advance toward Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.
Over the past week, Russia used more than 40 missiles, 750 guided aerial bombs and 200 attack drones against Ukrainian cities and villages, Zelensky said Sunday.
“For such terror, the occupier must be held accountable before the courts and history. They are already facing the strength of our warriors,” Zelensky said.
Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the Ukrainian army chief, told Zelensky, “Our guys are doing great on all fronts,” but he called for Ukraine’s Western partners including the United States, the United Kingdom and France to deliver supplies quicker.
“There are no vacations in war,” Syrskyi said.

US officials told CNN that Russia has diverted thousands of troops from occupied territory inside Ukraine to counter the threat. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has had to bring in conscripts, backpeddling on a promise he made not to use them on the frontline.
A sizeable trench has been dug across countryside near the town of Selektsionnyi, around 45 kilometers (about 28 miles) from the border, in Kursk, satellite imagery showed. Online job adverts for trench diggers have emerged. “Payment every week,” promised one.
Experts told CNN that Ukraine’s bold gambit to breach Russia’s border, planned in complete secrecy, had stunned even Kyiv’s closest allies, including the United States, shifting the playing field of a more than two-year-old war.
But after months on the backfoot, losing ground in grinding battles in their own territory, just how were the Ukrainians able to catch Moscow by surprise and penetrate the Russian homeland?
First: superb operational security. Nothing about the operation leaked. Based on videos from the ground and satellite imagery of their advance, the troop movements almost seemed like an exercise or a defensive reinforcement.
“[Ukraine has] demonstrated that they can pull off such a secretive and significant operation successfully, they can penetrate Russian territory so this is no longer the red line, and they … are still very much committed to fight for their country, that there is no such thing as war fatigue, and they’re willing to take these, in a way, extreme measures for the sake of defending their country,” Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the UK’s Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies (RUSI), told CNN.
The force was built up under cover of thick summer foliage along the rural roads of Sumy region, in northeast Ukraine. Experienced, battle-hardened units were brought up or diverted from other areas. Units such as the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, which had until recently been fighting in nearby Kharkiv region, were pulled into the mission to breach the border, according to multiple videos and social media accounts.
Among the detailed preparations was precise intelligence on the readiness and ability of Russian units on the border, and the number of obstacles that lay ahead, from minefields to tank traps. There weren’t many.
Ukrainian forces also used detailed knowledge of the geography to launch the attack, using forest belts for cover and roads for speed. It was only in the last days before the incursion began that commanders were briefed on the mission.
“The key, in terms of Ukraine’s success, [was that] they managed to penetrate Russian territory quite easily with little to no resistance. It was a complete surprise for the Russians, and it demonstrates that Russian intelligence services really failed to foresee any sort of Ukrainian incursion into the region,” said Seskuria.
Having established weak points in Russian defenses, the first Ukrainian units stormed into Kursk on the afternoon of August 6.
Videos on social media, which were geolocated by CNN, appear to show dozens of Russian soldiers immediately surrendering at the heavily damaged border crossing south-west of the town of Sudzha, located 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of the city of Kursk.
Serhii Sternenko, a Ukrainian vlogger who shared the video on his Twitter and Telegram channels, said it showed at least 22 Russian soldiers “surrender” in the Kursk region. CNN was unable to confirm the identity of those shown in the footage.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had taken control of Sudzha – the first official confirmation that the troops, which have been in the town since last Wednesday, had captured it.
The town is an important transit point for gas supples from Russia to Europe via Ukraine. Satellite images showed a gas terminal at a nearby border point in ruins.
In their charge across the border, Ukrainians have used fast, resilient western-made armored vehicles: Strykers and Marders. Small mobile groups of special forces swiftly fanned out to dozens of locations as the Russian military scrambled to assess the strength of the assault.
Key to their success: air defenses and supporting artillery, as well as jamming to prevent the Russian military from communicating. Thermal protection for their body armor also helped soldiers evade heat-detecting drones.
Within hours of crossing the border, the Ukrainians were close to Sudzha. Many of its residents were sent scrambling on hair-raising escapes, some cursing the Russian military for abandoning them.
As the operation unfolded, Ukrainian soldiers posted video of themselves in front of village signs before vanishing, part of a parallel campaign of psychological warfare.
CNN geolocated numerous videos showing Ukrainian forces posing in front of road signs and taking down Russian flags at village halls across the Kursk region, including in Porozovsky, Plekhovo, Sverdlikovo, Guyevo and Sudzha.
“I think that has a great value in terms of information warfare because these images, videos that we see … that is a really good morale boost for Ukrainians,” said RUSI’s Seskuria.
Rather than confront Russian units head-on, advanced Ukrainian units bypassed them, cutting them off. The Russian military command struggled to keep up with where the threat was emanating from.
At the same time, the Ukrainians trained their attention on Russian reinforcements, wiping out one convoy of 14 Russian military vehicles near Rylsk with a missile attack. Video shared on social media, which CNN geolocated to the village of Oktyabr’skoe in the Kursk region, showed the dead bodies of Russian soldiers in destroyed and burned-out trucks along a section of road.
The head of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Thursday that Ukrainian forces had captured 1,150 square kilometers (about 444 square miles) of territory and 82 settlements since the start of the surprise incursion.
More than a week after the incursion began, the Ukrainians were still probing for weaknesses, consolidating their hold on a band of territory 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) deep – even providing Russian civilians with emergency food aid.
Seskuria told CNN that Ukraine’s incursion is partly a “self-defense measure … because Kursk region, due to its location, has been used many times to launch missiles on Ukrainian territory.”
“[Ukraine’s] strategic aim would be to divert Russian forces from offensive operations in the Donetsk oblast, where Russians have been making some advances in the recent months… that would be an obvious intention, to ease the military pressure in Ukraine.”
Seskuria added that Ukraine’s recent activity might provide Ukraine with “a better negotiating position when it comes to any sort of peace talks in the future.” Indeed Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Zelensky, said the incursion was aimed at persuading Russia to enter a “fair negotiation process.”
Russian military bloggers are apoplectic about the lack of readiness and the slow response to the incursion.
The Russian Defense Ministry insisted this week it was repelling Ukrainian advances and taking prisoners, but Russia’s reinforcements were struggling to retake ground, outmaneuvered and hit with missiles and artillery.
Can Kasapoğlu, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute, a think tank based in Washington, DC, told CNN he did not foresee a Ukrainian withdrawal anytime soon.
“The offensive is culminating, and the battleground is stabilizing. Nonetheless, the Ukrainian military has already secured operational depth. If they can set robust defensive positions … they can stay inside Russian territory for a long time,” he said.
Kursk would be Ukraine’s “crown jewel” when negotiating an end to the conflict, Kasapoğlu added, if Kyiv manages to hold on to the seized territory.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/politics/us-watch-ukraine-push-into-russia/index.html,US watches closely as Ukrainian forces push into Russia with US-provided arms,2024-08-16 23:45:59,"The US has watched closely as Ukrainian forces pushed deeper into Russian territory, powered in part by US-provided arms and equipment that have raised questions about whether Kyiv has abided by the Biden administration’s restrictions on the use of American weaponry.
Ukraine has used US weaponry and vehicles as part of its offensive, according to officials, even though the Biden administration did put boundaries on the use of US weaponry in Russia, according to two US officials. The officials would not detail the exact boundaries the US drew but said Ukraine had not “technically” breached the US-imposed limitations.
US-made Humvees were seen entering Russia’s Kursk oblast through the Ukraine-Russia border crossing near Sudzha, Russia, on Tuesday in a Reuters photograph.
Ukraine has also used HIMARS rocket launchers as part of the operation, officials said, but the vehicles appear to have remained in Ukrainian territory, using the range of its GMLRS missile to hit Russia.
The Russian Ministry of Defense released drone video on Thursday, showing a HIMARS rocket-launching vehicle firing missiles in a wooded area just under five miles from the Russia-Ukraine border. The US’ restrictions on the use of long-range ATACMS missile has not changed, US officials said. Ukraine has used the missiles to strike Russian air defense systems in Russian-occupied Crimea.
On Friday, Russia’s foreign ministry said Ukraine had likely used HIMARS to destroy a bridge over the Seym river in the Kursk region, adding the strike killed volunteers trying to evacuate civilians.
It’s unclear to what extent the US vehicles have been used so far in the operation in Kursk.
Pro-Russian Telegram channels have circulated images claiming to show a destroyed Ukrainian convoy in the Kursk oblast. CNN is unable to determine the exact location where the photos were taken, but one of the destroyed vehicles is a US-made Cougar MRAP.
One US official said Ukraine’s military has used US-made Stryker combat vehicles capable of moving infantry across a battlefield. Video released by the Russian Ministry of Defense claims to show a military strike hitting a US-made Stryker vehicle in a wooded area, but CNN could not verify the claim.
On Friday, Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ssaid the Ukrainian military, already some 35 kilometers into Russian territory, is still advancing “in some areas from 1 to 3 kilometers.” The operation has put the Kremlin on the defensive, forcing Russia to bring in troops from the front lines to repel the ongoing Ukrainian raid.
“Overall, the situation is under control. All activities are being carried out according to plan,” Syrskyi said.
The US drew a box north of Ukraine from which Russian forces were carrying out attacks and instructed Kyiv to keep their use of American weapons contained to that area, according to two US officials. The officials would not describe the exact location of the geographic box or its size, but they said Ukraine’s incursion has remained within its borders, and the operation has not violated US policy regarding the use of American weapons on Russia.
Because the operation has remained within the agreed upon area, officials say it has not “technically” breached US-imposed limitations. One official said the Ukrainian offensive follows the “letter of the law” when it comes to US policy but acknowledged it’s “not what we had in mind.”
The US has not publicly taken a position on Ukraine’s maneuver, which officials say has had a “surprising” amount of success.
The Biden administration has not instructed Kyiv to pull back its forces into Ukraine, nor has it thrown its full support behind the operation. Instead, the administration has been careful in stating openly that it will continue to back Ukraine’s ability to defend itself.
“They’re going to continue to have American support for the defense of their territory for defeating Russian aggression,” John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, told CNN Friday.
Equally surprising, officials said, is the Kremlin’s slow response to the incursion, the first time Russia has lost sovereign territory since invading Ukraine more than two years ago.
Russia appears to have diverted at least several thousand troops away from front-line fighting in occupied Ukraine in order to address the territorial loss in the Kursk region. One US official said Russia will likely end up having to send more troops to the area to strengthen its own defenses, as the US watches to see where Russia will find the manpower.
Meanwhile, senior US officials have tried to gain a better understanding of Kyiv’s goal in carrying out the offensive into Russia. Ukraine did not inform the US in advance of the incursion, and the US is still not clear on what the long-term goal is for the operation.
On Friday, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the cross-border incursion is aimed at creating a “fair negotiation process” and inflicting “significant tactical defeats” on Russia.
“Negative changes in the psychological state of the Russian population will be another argument for the start of negotiations,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, on social media.
Russia’s reaction may be delayed, officials said, but there is little doubt that a response is coming. Ukraine says it has seized approximately 400 square miles of territory inside Russia, forcing Russian authorities to declare emergencies and carry out large-scale evacuations.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, Wednesday and tried to learn more about the objectives of the offensive, launched nearly two weeks ago.
“Throughout the department, we are engaging with the Ukrainians trying to get a better understanding of their objectives,” said deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.
Pressed on whether Austin told Umerov that he supports the operation, Singh demurred.
“What I can tell you is where we are supportive and that is Ukraine continuing to defend itself,” she said.","['Oren Liebermann', 'Paul Murphy']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/17/europe/russia-approaching-key-ukraine-city-intl-hnk/index.html,Russia ‘rapidly approaching’ key Ukraine city despite Kursk setback,2024-08-03 00:00:00,"Russia is “rapidly approaching” a key military hub in eastern Ukraine, a local official has said, as Moscow continues its advances despite Kyiv’s surprise gains in its enemy’s Kursk region.
While Pokrovsk is not a major city – about 60,000 people lived there before the war and many have left since the start of the full-scale invasion – it serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military thanks to its easy access to Kostiantynivka, another military center.
Ukrainian troops use the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties toward Dnipro.
Serhii Dobriak, head of the Pokrovsk city military administration, urged the community there to evacuate without delay.
“The enemy is rapidly approaching the outskirts of Pokrovsk,” he said in a Telegram post on Thursday.
His warning is proof that Moscow has not relented in its attack on other parts of Ukraine, despite Kyiv’s successful incursion across the border over the past week, a major development after two-and-a-half years of open conflict.
Ukraine said it has captured more than 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory since the start of its surprise assault, forcing tens of thousands of Russians from their homes.
On Friday, Russia’s foreign ministry said Ukraine had used Western rockets for the first time to destroy a bridge over the Seym river in the Kursk region, adding the strike killed volunteers trying to evacuate civilians.
HIMARS, or the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, has perhaps been the most revered and feared piece of weaponry in Ukraine’s fight and since arriving have helped Ukraine to take back significant swaths of territory from Russia.
Ukraine has used US weaponry and vehicles as part of its push into Russian territory, according to US officials, even though the Biden administration did put boundaries on the use of US weaponry in Russia.
Ukraine officials said its military, already some 35 kilometers into Russian territory, is still advancing “in some areas from 1 to 3 kilometers,” on Friday.
Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from frontline fighting in occupied Ukraine in order to address the territorial loss in the Kursk region.
But according to Dobriak, the enemy is “almost right up close” to Pokrovsk, Ukraine’s key logistics and military hub that has become the focus of the Russian offensive in the Donetsk region.
“They are a bit more than 10 kilometers (about 6.2 miles) from the outskirts of Pokrovsk,” he said, adding that the situation “is only getting worse.”
For months, Russia has been stretching Ukrainian defenses across the entire front line, trying to capture as much territory as possible before new Ukrainian recruits and fresh batches of Western weapons start arriving on the battlefield.
The gains made by Russia have been largely incremental – the front line has barely moved in the past few months – but the recent advance toward Pokrovsk has Ukraine and its allies worried.
The city’s capture would bring Russian President Vladimir Putin closer to his goal of seizing all of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Kostiantynivka is the southernmost part of a belt of four Ukrainian cities – with Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – that form the backbone of Ukraine’s defenses of the region, so any progress of Russian troops toward the city is significant.
Officer of Ukraine’s 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade Serhii Tsehotskyi told Ukrainian national broadcaster Suspilne on Friday that Ukraine’s incursion into Russia had not led to a decrease in Moscow’s attacks in the Donetsk region.
He said Russian attempts to advance do not stop “for a minute,” and “the battles continue around the clock.”
“Taking into consideration the events in the Kursk region, they (the Russian forces) are trying to do everything in order to be successful at least somewhere,” he said.
Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged Friday that “intense fighting” is taking place in the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk.
The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Thursday that Russian forces are “maintaining their relatively high offensive tempo” in Donetsk, “demonstrating that the Russian military command continues to prioritize advances in eastern Ukraine even as Ukraine is pressuring Russian forces within” the Kursk region.

The Ukrainian military had no editorial control.
Bodies decomposing in the street. Bullet-marked civilian cars lining the road. Half of Lenin’s face blown away from the statue on the square. Streets littered with shrapnel. Locals huddling in a bomb shelter.
The smell of death, in buildings torn open.
It is a scene achingly familiar to Ukraine, yet until now alien to Russia. But the border town of Sudzha was assaulted by Ukraine eleven days ago and claimed by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday as under their control. When Russian President Vladimir Putin began his war of choice two years ago, Russia did not expect to get invaded back.
CNN crossed into Russia accompanied by the Ukrainian military, past the border post torn to shreds by Ukraine’s first attack. With the skyline ahead occasionally marred by black smoke from explosions, the road itself was surreally calm. On either side, tranquil fields once protected by a Cold War superpower that had not seen an invasion since the Nazis.
The turnoff into Sudzha was marked with a huge Orthodox Christian cross, upon which was written “God save and protect us.” Yards away lay the wreckage of two tanks and other armor from the intense fighting days earlier.
The town’s streets were mostly vacant, yet echoed with the storm raging around them. Small arms fire and outgoing artillery broke the silence, but at a distance.
Our Ukrainian escort said the Russian attack drones that had blighted Ukraine’s progress on the front lines in the past months were simply too busy at the frontline battles to harass Kyiv’s forces at the border and in Sudzha. Their conspicuous absence, and that of Russian air power, suggested a possible improvement in Ukraine’s capabilities for this surprise assault. The ubiquity of Western-supplied armored vehicles on the roads into Russia showed Ukraine was throwing resources it had long claimed it lacked into this fight.
Sudzha was not completely deserted. At one large building, outside the basement entrance, a large cardboard hand-written sign announced, “Here are peaceful people in the basement, no military.” Inna, 68, sat outside. There were 60 other civilians downstairs, she said.
“They brought a lot of boxes, their food,” she said of the Ukrainian forces.
In the basement was a scene we have witnessed in dozens of Ukrainian towns over the past two years, and still as saddening in Russia.
At the entrance to the shelter was Stanislav, who stroked his gray beard when asked how life was. “See, this is not life. It is existing. It is not life.”
In the dark, subterranean dank were the infirm, isolated, and confused. One elderly woman, still in her wig and bright red summer dress, rocked slightly as she intoned: “And now I don’t know how it will end. At least a truce so we can live peacefully. We don’t need anything. It’s my crutch, I can’t walk. It’s very hard.” Flies buzzed around her face, in humid gloom.
In the next room, the light flickered on a family of six. The man said, “A week. No news. We don’t know what’s happening around us.” His son sat silent next to him, his white face stony.
At the end of the corridor, talking to one of our Ukrainian escorts was Yefimov, who said he was in his 90s. His daughter, niece and grandchildren are married to Ukrainian men and live in Ukraine, yet he cannot reach them.
“To Ukraine,” he said, when asked where he wanted to flee. “You are the first to mention it. People talked about it but you are the first to come.” The idea of evacuation would be arduous for many here in peacetime.
On the street outside is Nina, 74, searching for her medication. The shops are shredded and pharmacies closed. She insists she does not want to leave, with the same passionate defense of her right to live where she always has as so many Ukrainian women of her age, in similar scarred towns.
“If I wanted to I would. Why would I leave where I lived 50 years? My daughter and mother are in the graveyard and my son was born (here), my grandkids… I live on my land. I don’t know where I live. I don’t know whose land this is, I don’t understand anything.”
It is unclear how and where this fast, successful and surprise assault ends, or when Russian forces arrive. Yet they will be too late to reverse another dent in Russia’s pride since it began an invasion meant to take only a matter of days in February 2022.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en

Kyiv’s forces have been in the town, located 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of the city of Kursk, since last Wednesday, but this is the first confirmation from the Ukrainian president that his army had captured it.
Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops have advanced 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 1,150 square kilometers of territory and 82 settlements.
Syrskyi said a military commandant’s office has been set up in Sudzha “to maintain law and order and meet the priority needs of the population in the controlled territories.”
Sudzha is located next to a Russian gas terminal, a key point for supplying gas from Russia, via Ukraine, to Europe. This has prompted speculation that one of Kyiv’s goals could be to curtail a lucrative source of funding for Moscow.
Ukraine’s ground incursion has forced tens of thousands of Russians from their homes and put Russia on the back foot as it scrambles to repel Kyiv’s troops.
Wednesday saw Ukrainian drones target four Russian airfields in the largest such attack of the war. A source in Ukraine’s security service told CNN the attack targeted four bases in the southwest regions of Kursk and Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow.
Russia’s defense ministry said it destroyed 117 “aircraft-type” drones and four tactical missiles over Kursk and neighboring regions.
Ukraine’s assault – which poses a major embarrassment for the Kremlin – represents a notable change in tactics for Kyiv, marking the first time foreign troops have entered Russian territory since World War II.
Russia has pulled reserves from key battleground areas in Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea to repel Kyiv’s advances, a Ukrainian military commander told CNN Wednesday.
The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed in an update posted on Telegram Thursday to have recaptured the first village from Ukrainian forces in Kursk region – the settlement of Krupets.
Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed on Monday to “kick the enemy out” of Russia after it emerged that dozens of Russian villages were under Ukrainian control.
Ukraine meanwhile continues its struggle along the eastern front, where Russian forces have been making incremental gains for months. Ukraine on Thursday reported the heaviest fighting in weeks near the eastern city of Pokrovsk. Serhii Dobriak, head of Pokrovsk city military administration, wrote on Telegram that the enemy was “almost right up close to our community” and little more than 6 miles (10km) from the city.
Dobriak continued to urge all citizens to “evacuate without delay.”","['Caitlin Danaher', 'Sophie Tanno']",en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/russia-has-diverted-several-thousand-troops-from-occupied-ukraine-to-counter-kursk-offensive-us-officials-say/index.html,"Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from occupied Ukraine to counter Kursk offensive, US officials say",2024-08-15 16:54:00,"Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from occupied territory inside Ukraine to counter a surprisingly successful Ukrainian offensive inside Russian borders in a move that potentially weakens Moscow’s war effort, two senior US officials told CNN.
The development has drawn American attention and US officials are now working to determine precisely how many troops Russia is moving, but sources said multiple brigade-sized elements made up of at least 1,000 troops each appeared to have shifted to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an operation last week.
“It is apparent to us that Mr. Putin and the Russian military are diverting some resources, some units, towards the Kursk Oblast to ostensibly counter what the Ukrainians are doing,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Thursday.
The Russian troop movements away from Ukraine “doesn’t mean that Mr. Putin has given up military operations in the northeast part of Ukraine or even down towards the south, towards places like Zaporizhya,” Kirby said. “There’s still active fighting along that front.”
But the movements have raised the tantalizing possibility that what originally appeared to be a quixotic bid by Ukraine to humiliate Russian President Vladimir Putin could have a more significant strategic impact on the battlefield, depending on how long Ukraine is able to hold the Russian territory.
The Ukrainian operation has impressed American officials, particularly the way the Ukrainian military was able to keep its details so secret—the incursion even caught US officials by surprise, officials said.
While the operation has risked softening some of Ukraine’s own defenses along the 600-mile frontline, it may also divert Russian troops who have been making some incremental gains inside Ukraine through the summer, sources added. Ukraine says it has captured over 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory since the start of its surprise assault, forcing tens of thousands of Russians from their homes.
A senior US official and a senior European intelligence official both said a major goal of the operation appears to be to create “strategic dilemmas” for Putin, particularly when it comes to where Russia should allocate manpower.
Still, Russia is believed to have hundreds of thousands of troops on the frontline in Ukraine, so diverting a few thousand may not have a large impact in the short term, officials said.
Russia also does not appear to be moving its larger and better-trained units away from Ukraine and into Kursk just yet, said two other sources familiar with western intelligence. One of those sources said Russia appears to instead be bolstering Kursk’s defenses primarily with untrained conscripts taken from elsewhere in Russia.
“We haven’t seen a substantial move [of Russian troops] just yet, and we can’t tell whether that’s just because they’re only just getting started moving forces, or whether they just don’t have the forces to move,” said one of the sources familiar with US intelligence.
In addition to the troops moved from inside Ukraine, Russia has also sent personnel from the Leningrad military district and Kaliningrad, in Russia, to help defend Kursk, one of the senior US officials said.
Even as they acknowledged the limited success of the Kursk operation thus far, multiple US and western officials familiar with the latest intelligence cautioned that Ukraine is extremely unlikely to be able to hold the territory for long and emphasized that it’s too soon to judge how the operation will affect the broader outcome of the war.
The US also remains reluctant to allow Ukraine to use long-range, US-provided weapons inside Kursk, multiple officials said—not because of the risk of escalation, but because the US only has a limited supply of the long-range missiles, known as ATACMS, to provide to Ukraine and thinks they would be better used to continue targeting Russian-occupied Crimea, officials said.
Some officials also raised concerns that Ukraine, which one western official said has sent some of its more experienced forces into Kursk, may have created weaknesses along its own frontlines that Russia may be able to exploit to gain more ground inside Ukraine.
“It’s impressive from a military point of view,” the official said of the Kursk operation. But Ukraine is “committing pretty experienced troops to this and they can’t afford to lose those troops.”
“And having diverted them from the front line creates opportunities for Russia to seize advantage and break through,” this person added.","['Katie Bo Lillis', 'Natasha Bertrand']",en

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the military for the attacks, which he described as “precise, timely and effective,” in a video address released the same day he said Kyiv’s forces had captured Russian soldiers in southern Russia and destroyed a Russian fighter jet.
“Our Ukrainian drones work exactly as they should. Still, there are things that cannot be done with drones alone,” Zelensky said.
A source in Ukraine’s security service told CNN it was the “biggest attack” on Russia’s airfields since the war began and targeted four bases in the southwest regions of Kursk and Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow.
It comes as Ukraine’s massive ground incursion has forced tens of thousands of Russians from their homes and put Russia on the back foot as it struggles to repel Kyiv’s troops.
Russia’s defense ministry said Wednesday it destroyed 117 “aircraft-type” drones and four tactical missiles over Kursk and neighboring regions.
More than 35 Ukraine-launched drones were destroyed over Voronezh, its Gov. Aleksandr Gusev said Wednesday on Telegram.
While there were no casualties, the attack damaged properties, vehicles and municipal infrastructure, Gusev said, adding there was a risk of further drone attacks.
A statement by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Wednesday claimed that Ukraine’s Air Force “destroyed a Russian SU-34 fighter-bomber” in the Kursk region on Tuesday night.
In Belgorod, which neighbors Kursk, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov declared a regional emergency Wednesday, calling the situation on the ground “extremely difficult and tense” in a message on Telegram. Residents began evacuating Monday because of Ukrainian advances.
Regional authorities are now appealing to the Kremlin to declare a federal emergency, Gladkov said.
In his address Wednesday, Zelensky called for further support from Ukraine’s Western supporters, saying: “We need other weapons - missile weapons. And we continue to work with our partners on long-range solutions for Ukraine.”
Ukraine’s Western partners have been reluctant to supply Kyiv with long-range missiles that can penetrate deep into Russian territory.
Zelensky said his forces had advanced in Russia’s Kursk region by 1 to 2 kilometers since the beginning of the day and had captured 100 Russian servicemen.
Kyiv has already claimed to have control over some 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory since the start of its surprise assault.
A video posted by the Agence France-Presse news agency at the border crossing between Ukraine’s Sumy region and Kursk showed a Ukrainian truck carrying blindfolded men in Russian military uniforms traveling away from Russia.
CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for comment on the video.
‘Buffer zone’
Ukraine’s incursion – which poses a major embarrassment for the Kremlin – represents a notable change in tactics for Kyiv, marking the first time foreign troops have entered Russian territory since World War II.
Since the incursion began, tens of thousands of Russians have fled their homes while Moscow scrambles to contain the attack, imposing counter-terror operations in Kursk, Belgorod and another border region, Bryansk.
Russia has pulled reserves from key battleground areas in Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea to repel Kyiv’s advances, a Ukrainian military commander told CNN Wednesday.
Dymtro Kholod, commander of the “Nightingale” battalion, told a CNN team on the ground in Sumy that the military had “information” suggesting Russian soldiers were being pulled from Zaporizhzhia, Crimea and Kharkiv to halt Kyiv’s forces.
A Ukrainian minister said the aim of the operation in Kursk is to create a “security zone” on Russian soil to protect border communities, particularly in Sumy, which have seen persistent Russian artillery and missile fire throughout the war.
“The creation of a buffer zone in the Kursk region is a step to protect our border communities from daily enemy attacks,” Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram.
Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk also said Ukraine would open “humanitarian corridors” to evacuate civilians either to Ukraine or within Russia.
Ukraine’s latest move has prompted an angered Russia to take peace negotiations off the table for the foreseeable future.
The Russian Foreign Ministry’s special envoy, Rodion Miroshnik, said at a briefing on Wednesday that Moscow will be “at minimum” putting the talks with Ukraine on a “long pause.” Peace negotiations between the warring nations have proven unsuccessful since the start of the war in February 2022.
Russia’s National Guard said on Wednesday it had tightened security around the Kursk nuclear plant in Russia’s southwest.
Last week, the director general of the United Nations nuclear watchdog urged both sides to exercise maximum restraint to avoid a nuclear accident.
On Monday, Kyiv claimed to have gained control of nearly the same amount of land that Russia had seized so far this year – though that is still dwarfed by the total Ukrainian territory held by Russia since the conflict started in 2014.
On Tuesday, Zelensky said Kyiv’s forces were in control of 74 settlements in Kursk and they are making preparations for “next steps” in the region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has meanwhile vowed to “kick the enemy out” of Russia.
US President Joe Biden addressed the incursion on Tuesday, saying he was receiving regular updates from staff and that it was “creating a real dilemma for Putin.”","['Nick Paton Walsh', 'Lex Harvey']",en

“This is the consequence of (the Russians) coming into our land,” Hanna Fedorkovska told CNN at an evacuation center in Sumy, a city just south of the border.
“We entered their territory not because we wanted to, but because they came to our home and took away our peaceful life. Now they have to deal with it. I hope that it will not be in vain and that we will get peace.”
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that Kyiv’s forces were pushing farther into Russia after claiming hundreds of square miles of its territory. Kyiv said its troops have been expanding on a “buffer zone” inside Russia, which they say will better protect communities in northern Ukraine.
Fedorkovska, 21, came to the evacuation center with her 72-year-old grandmother, who was inconsolable after leaving her husband and the home they’ve shared for 52 years.
The two women were among hundreds of Ukrainians evacuated from border areas in recent days. Fedorkovska, a student, said her 85-year-old grandfather insisted on staying behind, telling her: “You save your grandmother, and I will guard what we own.”
The surprise counteroffensive brought a much-needed boost for Ukraine’s military, but it has also left some Ukrainians, including Fedorkovska and her grandmother, worried about what will happen once Russia gathers enough troops to the area to push back.
“I wish our guys good luck, because if they do not hold on to the (Russian) lands they have now seized, I think there will be a lot of troubles in Sumy region. It will be the second Mariupol, I think,” Sergey Zemlyakov, a former soldier who fought in the eastern Donbas region in 2014 and 2015, told CNN at the evacuation center.
Mariupol, in the Donetsk region, fell to Russian control in 2022 following months of besiegement and bombardment, thousands of reported deaths, and tales of horror and starvation.
Russian aerial attacks
Nila Buhaiova, who works at the Department of Social Protection in the Sumy regional administration, said hundreds of people came through the center’s doors in recent days.
“The evacuation has intensified over this past week … when the shelling of the Sumy district started, people could not stay anymore, so they left. On Friday there were 270 people, on Saturday 382, and on Sunday 250,” she said.
The numbers are dwarfed by the evacuations on the Russian side of the border. Local officials in the Kursk region said some 180,000 people there have been put under evacuation orders, with thousands more evacuated from neighboring Russian regions.
But for many Ukrainians, it’s hard to feel sorry for their neighbors.
Fedorkovska’s grandparents stayed in their home in Myropillya after the war broke out in 2022, even though the village is surrounded by Russia’s Kursk region on three sides and has been under frequent attack ever since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
But the area has become too dangerous now that Ukraine has launched its surprise incursion.
“After the start of the Kursk operation, artillery and mortar attacks stopped because our guys drove them away from the border. But the attacks with guided bombs and aircraft have intensified. Now they can’t reach us with artillery, so they shoot from the aircraft,” Fedorkovska said, explaining why her grandmother had finally decided to evacuate.
“We want people to understand what it’s like to live under constant shelling, to live in a place where you have lived your whole life, a place you put your heart and soul into, where you raised your children, went to school … and that you are forced to leave and move somewhere else because there’s constant shelling now.”
Olena Lozko is an accountant from the Ukrainian village of Velyka Rybytsia, which sits about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Russian border. She too has left in recent days amid the intensifying attacks by Moscow’s forces.
“We are very happy that our soldiers are attacking, but we are very scared. We have nowhere to go, and we are very afraid of these glide aerial bombs,” she said. “The situation is getting worse.”
Russia’s FAB-1500 guided glide bomb is a 1.5-tonne weapon nearly half comprised of high explosives. They are delivered by fighter jets from about 60-70 kilometers away, out of range of many Ukrainian air defenses.
‘You attack – we attack too’
People farther away from the front lines hope that giving the Russians a taste of their own medicine could help bring the conflict to an end.
“It’s a signal to Russia that any action can cause a reaction. You attack – we attack too,” said Borys Lomako, a café owner from Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which is also near the border with Russia.
He told CNN he believes the counteroffensive will help Kharkiv – a city that has been under constant shelling for months – breathe a bit more easily.
“It’s life-affirming to me that we’re going to fight for our border, and we’re doing more than just pushing [the Russians] back to the front line. You enter our territory, we enter yours. Psychologically this is a change of position in this war,” he said.
Andrii Legin, a 40-year-old resident of the capital Kyiv, said he fears the response of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he called a “crazed dictator.”
“Russia may respond in any way, starting with a completely frantic military response. Or perhaps some kind of shift will happen among the Russian people because the war has moved to Russian territory. Let’s see how the Russians react to this,” he said.
He said he is certain of one thing, however.
“I don’t think it will do any good if we Ukrainians enjoy it,” he said. “Yet if this is the only way to call for peace, then maybe it does work.”

The explosions left gas billowing from Nord Stream 1 and 2 – two major conduits that transported Russian gas to Europe – and prompted a huge operation to find who was responsible.
A spokeswoman for Poland’s Public Prosecutors Office, Anna Adamiak, confirmed Poland had received a warrant from Germany seeking the arrest of a Ukrainian man, named as Volodymyr Z. She added that he had left Poland and was not arrested because he was not on a database of wanted people.
The news comes after three German outlets reported that the man – described as a male diver - along with two other Ukrainian suspects, are believed by German federal prosecutors to have launched an audacious underwater attack on the pipeline from a sailing boat in September 2022.
After a joint investigation, German outlets ARD, Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung reported Wednesday that the arrest warrant for the man had been sent to Poland’s government to approve in June. Germany’s Federal Public Prosecutor General did not comment on the reports when contacted by CNN. Die Zeit reported that the man denied involvement when contacted by the outlet.
The origin of the explosions has been a subject of intense speculation and further stoked political tensions in Europe seven months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Neither of the pipelines were actively transporting gas to Europe at the time of the leaks, though they still held gas under pressure.
Investigators found evidence of explosives at the sites in November 2022, leading Swedish prosecutors to conclude that the blasts were caused by an act of sabotage.
According to the new German media reports, investigators in Germany believe that the sailing boat set sail from Rostock, Germany in September 2022, stopping in Denmark, Sweden and Poland, with a six-person crew including five men and one woman.
During that voyage, the crew is reportedly suspected of diving into the Baltic Sea and attaching explosives to the massive Nord Stream pipelines, which subsequently detonated and damaged both lines, according to the outlets.
Last year, three US officials told CNN that the US had received intelligence from a European ally that the Ukrainian military was planning an attack on the pipelines three months before they were hit.
The New York Times meanwhile reported in 2023 that intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a group loyal to Ukraine, but acting independently of the government in Kyiv, were involved in the operation.
Ukraine’s government has always denied any involvement in the blasts.
The Nord Stream project had been controversial long before Russia invaded Ukraine. Several Western countries, among them Poland, raised fears it would increase Moscow’s influence over Europe.
Germany nonetheless championed the expensive multimillion dollar, 750-mile second pipeline, before eventually pulling the plug on the plans after Russia’s invasion, just as it was set to become operational.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/europe/why-ukraine-attacked-russia-intl/index.html,Why Ukraine attacked Russia and other questions about Kyiv’s incursion,2024-08-12 00:00:00,"A week into Ukraine’s surprise cross-border incursion into Russia, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Moscow does not have the situation under control.
Tens of thousands of Russians have been forced to flee their homes as Ukrainian troops continued to encroach onto Russian territory over the weekend and on Monday.
The incursion – the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II – is a major embarrassment for the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to “kick the enemy out” or Russia, but his troops are yet to stop the Ukrainian advance.
Here’s what we know.
What happened?
The first reports of Ukrainian troops crossing into Russia’s Kursk region, just north of the Ukrainian border, started to emerge late last Tuesday. But it wasn’t until several days later that Kyiv officially acknowledged its military was operating inside Russia.
The incursion marked a notable change of tactics from Kyiv. The Ukrainian military has in the past regularly attacked targets inside Russia with drones and missiles, and there have been limited cross-border attacks by Ukraine-aligned Russian saboteurs, but until last week it had not launched any official ground incursions across the border.
By Monday, Kyiv claimed to have control over some 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory. In terms of its size, it’s similar to the amount of Ukrainian land Russia managed to seize so far this year, estimated by the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) at 1,175 square kilometers (453 square miles).
Still, the area is dwarfed by the more than 100,000 square kilometers, or 18% of Ukraine’s total territory, taken by Russia since the conflict started in 2014.
Why is Kyiv doing this?
The objective of the incursion remains a mystery.
Kyiv is likely trying to achieve several goals: reclaim the initiative and boost the morale of its soldiers while diverting Russia’s attention and embarrassing Putin.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said over the weekend that the incursion was a way to put “pressure on the aggressor.”
On Monday, he added that it was “only fair” and beneficial to destroy the Russian positions that are used to launch strikes against Ukraine, saying thousands have been launched from the Kursk region since the beginning of June.
“Russia must be forced into peace if Putin wants to continue waging war so badly,” he said.
The Ukrainian government said it didn’t intend to annex Russia’s territory in the same way Moscow has annexed Crimea and other areas seized from Ukraine.
“Unlike Russia, Ukraine does not need (foreign territories). Ukraine is not interested in taking the territory of the Kursk region. But we want to protect our people’s lives,” spokesperson for the foreign ministry Heorhii Tykhyi said on Tuesday.
Ukraine has been under increased pressure along the 600-mile front line as Moscow in recent months, even as the long-awaited US military aid started to arrive to the front.
Moscow’s slow, grinding offensive along the entire frontline has been forcing Ukraine to commit to defensive operations rather than gear up for a counteroffensive.
While Russia’s advances have been mostly incremental, it has recently managed to inch towards several strategically important towns and roads in eastern Ukraine.
How has Putin reacted?
With fury. The scale of the crisis became clear on Monday, when Putin held a tense meeting with top security and government officials and the heads of the border regions, vowing to “kick the enemy out.”
A video of the meeting published by the Kremlin shows Putin scolding his subordinates, at one point shutting down the Kursk region’s acting governor Alexei Smirnov as he attempts to outline the scale of the invasion.
Smirnov was telling Putin that the Ukrainians were some 11 kilometers deep into Russian territory when Putin cut him off saying he can get that information from the military and ordered him to focus on social and economic issues instead.
Putin is not used to having his authority and power challenged and the incursion is the second major humiliation for the president in just over a year, after the Wagner mutiny last June.
While the private mercenary group’s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin ultimately failed and ended up dead after trying to challenge Putin, the episode caused a major crack in the image the president has been cultivating for decades.
What does it mean for Russia?
The magnitude of the crisis cannot be underestimated. For more than a decade, since Russia sparked the conflict in eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, the war Moscow has been waging on Ukraine barely touched the Russian people.
Widespread sanctions imposed by the West on Russia made international travel difficult and foreign goods expensive or innacessible, but the sense of safety from foreign attack has remained more or less intact.
That changed once Ukraine began using drones and missiles to regularly strike deeper inside Russia earlier this year, especially after Kyiv got permission from some of its allies to use their weapons for cross-border strikes. The ground incursion makes it even more apparent.
Moscow has been scrambling to contain the attack. Russian authorities imposed a sweeping counter-terror operation in three border regions – Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk – but stopped short of declaring the incursion an act of war.
The ISW said this was likely an attempt by the Kremlin to deliberately downplay the assault to prevent domestic panic or backlash over the fact that Russia was unable to defend its own borders.
What are Ukraine’s allies saying?
Putin has lashed out against Ukraine’s allies on Monday, claiming the “the West is fighting us with the hands of the Ukrainians.”
Yet everything seems to suggest that the incursion took by surprise not just Russia, but also some of Ukraine’s closest allies.
The Biden administration said last week it wasn’t made aware of Kyiv’s plans in advance, but it reiterated its support for Ukraine.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, the White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said: “Make no mistake about it: This is Putin’s war against Russia. And if he doesn’t like it, if it’s making him a little uncomfortable, then there’s an easy solution: He can just get the hell out of Ukraine and call it a day.”
Similarly, the European Union, Germany, the UK and other Western countries expressed support for Ukraine.
What happens next?
Analysts are not expecting Ukraine to attempt to advance much further into Russian territory. The success of the incursion was largely down to the surprise factor, with Moscow scrambling resources to try to defend its borders.
Once Russian reinforcements are in place, it is unlikely Ukraine would be able to hold onto the territory it managed to seize.
Russia has already relocated some of its troops stationed in occupied southern Ukraine to the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military officials.
Ukrainian Ground Forces Spokesperson Dmytro Lykhovii told Ukrainian media Tuesday that “some Russian military units” were moved to Kursk from the Pridniprovsky frontline and the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine. He caveated, however, that Russia had already amassed “a large number of personnel” in the Zaporizhzhia region.
“The number of units they are redeploying is relatively small to talk about any weakening or removal of the barrier to continue the offensive in the southern direction,” Lykhovii told Ukrainian TV outlet EspresoTV.
“We want to avoid the impression that we are already winning and that Kursk is ours. This is not the case at all. We emphasize that every segment and every area is important.”
Ukraine has spent the past few months trying to hold off further Russian advances, first while waiting for the long-delayed deliveries of US weapons and now as it awaits the newly recruited troops to get trained up and arrive to the front lines.
The incursion might have given it the boost it so desperately needed.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/europe/ukraine-incursion-russia-analysis-intl/index.html,Ukraine’s Russia gambit punctures Putin’s veneer of invincibility once again,2024-08-13 12:55:08,"It is another coin-flip in a conflict punctuated with at least annual reminders of how frail Vladimir Putin’s Russia truly is.
Two months ago, as Russian troops poured into Kharkiv region, Kyiv was eyeing its borders, concerned at where else Russia might find vulnerabilities. Yet instead, Ukraine appears to have looked at the map, decided Russia was equally exposed, and turned Moscow’s gambit on its head.
A week in, and whatever the final outcome of Ukraine’s invasion of Russia, Kyiv’s initially perplexing, perhaps even rash, decision to send thousands of troops into the Kursk region and beyond is paying stark dividends. For the second time in just over a year, the Kremlin has a hostile force marching in its south, and very little it can do about it. Last June, it was the homegrown rogue mercenaries of Wagner, headed to Rostov and on, to decapitate Russia’s top brass. Now, it is Ukraine’s own military, scything off what they claim is 1,000 square kilometers of border territory.
Some analysis at the weekend put the figure at about a third of that. Nevertheless, the ability of Ukraine’s commander Oleksandr Syrskyi to even float this claim is a remarkable win in the information war for Kyiv, even if Moscow severely limits what information Russians are exposed to.
“Bold, brilliant, beautiful,” was what veteran US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called Ukraine’s cross-border operation during a visit to Kyiv Monday. Meanwhile, US Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal called it “historic” and a “seismic breakthrough.”
The events are remarkably similar in how they expose the gulf between the veneer of impregnability the Kremlin tries to portray, and the ramshackle reality of its power. And while Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin’s march on Moscow fell apart when the former chef finally seemed to realize he was on his own – and had enraged Putin, rather than gaining his approval for tackling the failing top brass head-on – Ukraine’s forces seem to have little but their own supply lines and ambition holding them back.
Ukraine’s lightning advance is another example of their forces’ dexterity and mobility in warfare, over Moscow’s preference for slow, months-long grinding attacks on the same place. It is purposefully unclear exactly where Ukraine’s forces are. Videos pop up from towns far inside Russia, but without context. One overnight emerged from Lgov, about 26 miles from the border, with a soldier saying he promised his mother he would not go far.
It is also unclear where Ukrainian forces are digging in and where they are just racing through. The lack of transparency in the Russian system – where mistakes and problems are hidden rather than addressed head-on – works in Kyiv’s favor. It is unlikely Moscow, or even Kursk’s governor, knows the full picture of the mess they are in.
And the news the Kremlin is getting is uncharacteristically dire. When Kursk acting governor Alexei Smirnov told Putin on state TV on Monday that 28 settlements were under Ukrainian control, with 2,000 people’s fate unclear, and 121,000 residents evacuated, it’s likely the moment was staged and pre-recorded, like most of Putin’s televised meetings.
But to what avail? Putin turned the question towards his military chiefs, who he’s slowly decimated over the 30 months of this war’s ebb and flow. They clearly do not have the solution yet. But still Putin tries to play the role of the tsar adjudicating between chaotic and failing departments, despite on Wednesday being assured by his chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, that the Ukrainian advance had been halted. The last time this sort of invasion of Russia happened, Joseph Stalin was in charge, and he did something other than televise his failing leadership.
Two questions remain. The first regards the ultimate fate of Ukraine’s incursion. Do they intend to try and hold even the smallest amount of terrain? Do they intend to keep raging across undefended spaces? And how much firepower, manpower, and precious Western-supplied equipment is Ukraine happy to indulge this effort with? The merits of the assault are less in doubt than a week ago when it was first launched. Putin has a bloody nose. But the Ukrainian endgame needs to be as carefully engineered as the invasion to capitalize on Kyiv’s success.
The second is what impact does this have on Ukraine’s more challenged frontline in Donbas? During the past week, the successes of Kursk region have been peppered with worse news from Toretsk, or near Pokrovsk, as Russian forces continue their costly, bloody, yet inexorable advance. No matter how small the village, Moscow just keeps attacking.
So far, Ukraine’s hope the Kursk operation would lead better units to be withdrawn from Donbas to support Russia’s borders has yet to bear major fruit. As images continue to pour in of poorly trained Chechen troops being taken prisoner en masse by advancing Ukrainians in Kursk, it is clear Russia has sent its less effective units into the fight. They may choose to change that approach. Putin has also entrusted the operation to the FSB, the internal security service that also controls the border guard, which has instituted a “counter-terror operation.” This has previously been used to tackle Islamist insurgencies, not columns of Ukrainian armor. That, too, may have been very short-sighted.
Manpower crunch
But soon the crunch for Kyiv emerges. Where does this leave its forces a month from now? Has the talk of a manpower crunch over the past months been because they were secretly holding forces in reserve for this assault? Do they extract a strategic advantage great enough from these advances that Moscow’s view of them as a defeated adversary changes? Does the advance make their Western supporters decide the support is truly paying off?
Regardless of how efficiently Ukraine answers these questions, Russia has for the second time in 15 months been rudely humiliated. Firstly it was by Putin’s own loyalists, egotistically turning on corruption and mismanagement. This time it is Putin’s own FSB, who couldn’t keep control of the borders, in Putin’s war of choice. This falling tree may not make a sound in the heavily managed forest of Russia’s political space. Yet it probably hit others as it fell.
One fact endures however. Both Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russia’s Putin have referenced the incursion in terms of its role in talks. Putin said Ukraine was trying to improve its position ahead of talks – talks that still appear to lack an agenda, or a date, or any sense of trust between parties.
For his part, Zelensky said on Monday: “How useful this [incursion] can be for bringing peace closer.” He added: “Russia must be forced into peace if Putin wants to continue waging war so badly.” Kyiv knows it cannot enter talks with Russia without a strong hand, as the wildly deceptive negotiating style of the Kremlin has proven they simply stall for time unless they urgently need something from their interlocutor.
Still, even if Syrskyi only has half of the 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) he claims, a change in season to fall is no more than six weeks away, and with it the sludgy slowing of motion on the battlefield. Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive last summer has been eclipsed by the sudden success of this August incursion.
The dismal fortunes of last winter are not behind them yet, but they may approach the next with a better hand, and at the very least the idea of the Kremlin’s invulnerability - first broken in their failed initial invasion - shattered for at least the third time in this war.",['Nick Paton Walsh'],en
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/europe/russia-ukraine-incursion-belgorod-intl/index.html,Ukraine claims control of hundreds of square miles of Russian territory as operation forces tens of thousands to flee,2024-08-12 09:14:51,"Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to “kick the enemy out” of his country’s territory after it emerged that Ukrainian troops were in control of dozens of Russian villages and large swathes of land a week into Kyiv’s surprise cross-border incursion.
The scale of the incursion became clearer on Monday when Putin held a meeting with local officials from the border regions as well as some of Russia’s top security, government and law enforcement personnel.
The acting head of the Kursk region, Aleksey Smirnov, told Putin that 28 settlements in his region were now under Ukrainian control, adding that Ukrainian troops had managed to advance some 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) into the territory across a 25-mile (40-kilometer) wide stretch of the border.
Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Monday that some 386 square miles (1,000 square kilometers) of Russian territory were now under Ukrainian control.
Putin said the incursion was an attempt by Ukraine to “improve its negotiation position.”
“But what kind of negotiations can we even talk about with people who indiscriminately strike at civilians, at civilian infrastructure, or try to create threats to nuclear power facilities. What can we even talk about with them?” Putin said.
CNN cannot independently verify Putin’s claims that Ukraine has struck civilians in the incursion. Over the course of the war, Russia has been repeatedly accused of targeting Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure by Kyiv, its Western allies and by international bodies, including the International Criminal Court and the United Nations. Russia has denied the accusations, despite evidence.
Putin went on to tell his security chiefs to expel the Ukrainian forces: “The main task is certainly before the Ministry of Defense: to squeeze out, knock out the enemy from our territories and, together with the border guard service, ensure reliable protection of the state border.”
The Ukrainian advances have sparked a large wave of evacuations from the border regions. Smirnov said 180,000 people had been told to evacuate and that 121,000 have left already.
Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the neighboring Belgorod region in southern Russia, said people living in the Krasnoyaruzhsky district were being moved to safer places.
“We’re having a disturbing morning – enemy activities on the border of Krasnoyaruzhsky district. I am sure that our military will do everything to cope with this threat. But to protect the life and health of our people, we are beginning to relocate people who live in the Krasnoyaruzhsky district to safer places,” he said in a statement posted on his official Telegram channel.
About 11,000 residents from Krasnoyaruzhsky district were evacuated, the head of the district administration, Andrey Miskov, said later.
The incursion, which is now affecting two Russian regions, is seen as something of a game-changer in the conflict. The Ukrainian military has in the past regularly attacked targets inside the Belgorod region with drones and missiles, but until last week Kyiv had not launched any official ground incursions across the border in the two and half years since the start of the full-scale war.
The extent of the operation remains unclear.
An influential Russian military blog Rybar said on Monday that “apparently the (Armed Forces of Ukraine) is not shying away from plans to stretch our defensive formations, create the maximum number of points of tension, and attempt to break through in the east to cut Belgorod off from the north.”
Ukrainian officials are yet to comment on the current operations in Belgorod and CNN is unable to independently confirm Rybar’s claim.
A video geolocated by CNN posted on social media over the weekend shows Ukrainian soldiers holding their flag outside a rural social club in Poroz, a village that sits in Belgorod region about a mile from the international border.
Several Russian military bloggers reported an attempt by Ukrainian armed forces to attack a border crossing in the Belgorod region Monday morning, in the district that Russian authorities say is being evacuated.
CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry for comment.
The operation, which started last Tuesday, has been shrouded in mystery. Ukrainian officials for days remained silent, refusing to comment on reports of Ukrainian troops operating inside Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky finally confirmed Kyiv’s troops had crossed into Russia on Saturday, saying in his nightly address to the nation that “Ukraine is proving that it really knows how to restore justice and guarantees exactly the kind of pressure that is needed – pressure on the aggressor.”
On Monday, he said “Russia must be forced into peace if Putin wants to continue waging war so badly.” Zelensky reiterated that it is “only fair” and beneficial to destroy the Russian positions that are used to launch strikes at the Ukrainian territory and reminded that thousands of strikes have been launched from the Kursk region alone since June 1.
“Therefore, our operations are purely a security matter for Ukraine, the liberation of the border area from the Russian military,” he noted.
Diversionary tactic?
The reason for the attack is also unclear. Ukraine has been under increased pressure along the 600-mile front line as Moscow continues its slow, grinding offensive, inching towards several strategically important towns and roads in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian General Staff said Russia was targeting Toretsk, a strategic town just north of Donetsk. Toretsk lies on the southern end of a key road that connects Kostyantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, three Ukrainian cities that form the backbone of Ukraine’s defenses of the region.
According to two Ukrainian military bloggers, Russian forces are pushing into Toretsk from several locations, trying to outflank Ukrainian forces. One blogger said Russian forces were already operating within the city. Russian military bloggers suggested a similar strategy, claiming Moscow’s armies had advanced in several locations around the town.
CNN could not independently verify their accounts but video geolocated by CNN showed Russian forces operating just south of the city.
The Ukrainian cross-border attack could be an attempt by Kyiv to divert Russian resources elsewhere. Given the spate of more negative developments from the front lines, the news of a successful incursion may help Kyiv boost the morale of its troops and civilian population.
Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitoring group, say the situation at the front in the East remains largely unchanged, with Russian forces still retaining momentum and continuing on the offensive despite Ukraine’s push in the Kursk region.
Putin accused Ukraine of trying “to destabilize” his country, according to the Kremlin, adding that “a primary military objective” of the incursion is “to halt the advance” of Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.
He said currently “the pace of offensive operations” in the East “has actually increased by 50%” and the Russian troops are advancing “along the entire front.”
Moscow has been scrambling to contain the attack. Russian authorities imposed a sweeping counter-terror operation in three border regions – Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk – but stopped short of declaring the incursion an act of war.
The ISW said this was likely an attempt by the Kremlin to deliberately downplay the assault to prevent domestic panic or backlash over the fact that Russia was unable to defend its own borders.
“Russian President Vladimir Putin has refrained from officially declaring a state of war, has repeatedly demonstrated his unwillingness to transfer Russian society fully to a war-time footing, and has forgone declaring general mobilization as part of wider efforts to prevent domestic discontent that could threaten the stability of (his) regime,” the ISW said in its update.
The counterterrorist regime officially gives Russian authorities wider powers, including the ability to monitor telephone conversations and restrict communications and limiting the movement of people.",['Ivana Kottasová'],en
